       "\"Hello, my name is Donovan and this will be my first report regarding experiences of a psychedelic nature. Just to provide a little background regarding myself and the circumstances surrounding my encounter I will tell you that I am what some would call a very “spiritual” personality. My brother, Boob we call him, and I have been on a rollercoaster ride of fantastical advancements since we read “The Celestine Prophecy” in 1999. He, Boob I mean, leans a little more toward the theoretical side of our sojourn while I like to dive right into the more practical areas, which of course includes the use of psychedelic substances for the exploration of the psychological aspects of our perception. I had always been primarily interested in altered states of consciousness due to their ability to so brazenly expose one to their deepest illusions and most precarious understandings, and I had experimented with LSD and psilocybin as well as many of the more conventional substances such as marijuana and alcohol for quite some time to little avail. I found that THC helped to enhance my attention span and enthusiasm towards hobbies such as writing and playing video games, while the relaxing effects of alcohol allowed for me to be much more outgoing in social environments and to stop hiding my true nature from others. Hallucinogens provided a much needed and awe-inspiring vacation from the monotony of everyday life but had never left me with any truly groundbreaking insights into the nature of reality aside from revealing how dynamic and “liquid” my perception of it could actually become. I had thought that my aforementioned forays into the lesser known world would have prepared me for some of the more powerful experiences available to the human psyche but upon testing salvia for the first time I was made briskly aware of how deeply wrong I was. What happened in that instance would change my life forever, but that is a story for another time. In this submission I would like to make an attempt at illustrating as best I can the sheer craziness that is the DMT trip.After trying salvia a few times before reaching what I like to think of as the “bottom of the universal mystery” I became very frightened of that encounter with what seemed to be the “real world”, if such a place exists. However, I was still very enticed by the idea of returning, only under more manageable circumstances. With salvia I could  not even ascertain a method of fighting to remain myself let alone negotiate the great void to which I been introduced, and I was hoping to find an “easier” way to get “out there”. Meditation works to some extent, but could never take me so far so fast or in such a tangible and observable manner. At the same time no other narcotics could compare to the all-consuming effects of that simple little plant. I was in a fix to be sure. After spending the past couple of years dealing with severe family-related financial problems, having little to no time or aspiration for uncovering deeper levels of understanding I felt stunted and stifled in my quest for personal evolution. When we stumbled upon accounts of DMT and Ayahuasca induced adventures relating encounters with entities existing in a realm that seems “realer” than this one I felt that we had encountered providence, as we just so happened to know someone who actually had some DMT for sale at the time. As soon as Boob and I got back from work with our pay in pocket I purchased myself a one way ticket to “elsewhere” thinking that if I could handle salvia at full force then surely I would be capable of piloting the DMT vehicle without difficulty. Yet again, I would find myself deeply humbled.In order to relate my experience for what it truly was I must first elucidate my state of mind in regard to the occasion. Throughout the course of my spiritual and psychological training I have become deeply obsessed with the concept of an existing “God figure” in the universe. Now before you jump to any conclusions let me state that my fascination has absolutely nothing to do with any religious study or kinship, in fact, though I believe that some ideas related in the Bible and other such religious texts are especially relevant to my personal understanding, I do not, never have, and never will prescribe to any one religion and maintain my personal opinion that devotion to any religion destroys one’s ability to comprehend a true God to some extent if not completely. The God figure that I speak of is simply the infinite mystery of existence. Where did we come from? Where are we going? What is our absolute situation, our ultimate truth? What is really happening here? The God that I seek is simply an ultimate comprehension of who I really am beneath the manufactured illusions of an inescapably superficial reality. The self-proclaimed realizations that I had made during my encounters with salvia were particularly frightening to me and of course these would inevitably colour my experience with DMT. I intended only to maneuver deeper into this bizarre void of consciousness in the hope that some greater sanctity might be revealed thereat, and though I cannot be certain of the validity of my conclusions regarding the event, I do believe that just such an occurrence has transpired.Anyways, when I went to pick up the brown sugar-like pebbles from my buddy down the street he offered me some magic mushrooms that he had left over from a little while back along with it and I figured that one couldn’t go wrong with a price as cheap as free, another friend of mine had left my brother and I a couple bottles of wine that he had procured from the warehouse in which he works as a celebratory gift for me having recently acquired employment involving restorative carpentry with Boob in an impossible economic environment, and we already had some extremely beautiful weed to smoke, so I was sure that this would be a weekend to remember. I have a severely addictive personality and tend to overdo things as often as is possible. I rarely ever really regret this behavior, but boy was I in for it this time. I decided that since we had just finished a long and arduous week of woodworking and we were already tuckered out for the night that I would save the mushrooms and wine for the next day when we were well-rested and did not have to work in the morning, but I just could not will myself to wait on the DMT. I had already been waiting long enough.For the price of just ten dollars I obtained a plastic vial containing seven rocks resembling amber but smelling very similar to old dust in the attic of my childhood home, each of which would be sufficient to propel an individual into the cosmos. Of course, having no grasp for the gravity of the drug that I was about to abuse I asked Boob for a small nugget to pack as a filter and then proceeded to cover it with three stones smashed into powder. “Here we go!” I say confidently to my dear brother as I set the flame the pipe and pulled. I had intended to hold the hit in as long as possible for maximum effect but almost immediately found myself scrambling to get the smoke out before it all became too intense to endure.As soon as the smoke entered my lungs I witnessed the objects around me tear apart from their halos, leaving neon streaks of electromagnetism hanging in the air around them which stuck in place and then shrank as though being pulled by expansion into the vastness of space. At this point I remembered it, not from any experiential account that I can recall per se, but more from a primal, instinctive perspective. I “knew” what was happening, and all I that could say before collapsing on the floor was, “Ohhhhh...” The sound of my voice droned out into the rapidly shuffling distance as a wave of electrical vapor swelled into a tsunami that came flooding in from the right of me, and all that I could do to keep from being swallowed was drop onto my back and close my eyes in an attempt to escape the chaos that was suddenly ensuing all around me. I witnessed then, without eyes to see, the ceiling and walls of the room transform and inflate with a weightless force into an enormous dome of prisms resembling diamond eyeballs peering in at me from the edge of the world while radiating rainbow coronas in every direction. It was as though the living room had become this great museum of spectacles that had always been there just beyond my ability to perceive and had now been revealed, ephemerally, for me to partake of. I felt that though I could observe the museum from a singular point within the museum that somehow I, at the same time, am the museum. I wanted ever so desperately to exacerbate how amazing it was in vivid detail but all that I could manage was, “I can’t fraking explain it... I don’t even know what to do with myself here...” That was when the shifting began.Suddenly everything was tumbling and folding into itself, much like what I have experienced with salvia in the past, however, the difference is that this time I was still me and was able to see what was actually happening. The gravity was shifting, but not without deliberation. The very rules that make up the game of life were being rapidly changed ever so slightly by some alien persona very concisely, as though the function of the existential machine depended upon the shuffling of these values. When I use the term “alien” I do not mean extraterrestrial, I mean truly alien, inconceivable. Something entirely unknowable. Again, this conception is totally congruent with my experience of salvia, however, again, this time I can actually maneuver, and so I move toward the edge of the dome where I find a strange man standing in the corner manipulating pulleys and levers as though he was running the stage arrangement for some grand play. He works the mechanisms in the corner while turning his gaze around to me, smiling wildly. He looks eerily similar to Two-Face from Batman, and even appears two-dimensional, like a comic-book character. I think of him as being the museum’s curator. I can remember thinking, “This guy’s obnoxious.” before making my way back to the museum showroom in the center of the dome. Upon reaching said area I found myself standing in the living room again, effervescent clouds of color streaming from the walls into the vastness surrounding like a cacophony of vacuums oscillating infinitely. I could then just begin to hear disjointed ramblings approaching. It was a myriad of sounds collecting into small bunches that made up little symphonies. Each one was a different genre of music entirely and sounded quite discordant uniquely, but altogether the differing music created a larger orchestra and I could just barely make out the melody. The song was beautiful beyond words, yet still, I could not stand the madness. The rules were continuing to shift, the gravity continuing to fold, and I feared, yet again, that I would be lost forever. Looking over towards the couch I see Boob sitting straight up with his eyes fixed on me, and for the first time since the initial puff I can feel my own eyes and how wide they are. I must have appeared positively frightening at the time. When I see him I get the feeling that I am viewing a mirror of some kind and I am relieved that he is present. My exact thoughts were, “I’m cool, that’s Boob right there. That’s Boob? I’m Boob! I’m Boob? I’m not Boob. Have I been Boob this whole time?” and all of a sudden I am someone else. I have been the entire time. “Then who is Donovan?” I wondered. The riddle was humongous and encompassing. Everyone that I knew was in the room at this point, all going about separate businesses, I just couldn’t see them if I tried to look. I could feel them though, because I was them! “Residual memory.” I told myself, but I was my brother, so who was me? The rules continued to fluctuate, not immensely, but just enough to keep us all confused. The curator continues to meddle obnoxiously, but not without reason. I reach to my left and feel the leg of the coffee table.Suddenly I am back in the living room again. Boob notices the change in my demeanor and asks me if I’ve returned. “I think so” is all that I can honestly tell him. There is still a very conceivable current of electricity snaking its way throughout the room, but for all intents and purposes I am me again, and I am lucid. I tell Boob that I think I have to vomit and begin walking into the bathroom. Immediately upon entering I recognize a strong feeling of nostalgia sweeping over me like excessive déjà vu. I said to myself, “I’ve been here before” and for whatever reason it seemed so very sad and desperate, as if I’d been there forever. The area repeatedly assembled itself in patterns befitting its character and I felt as though I was standing backstage at the show of all things, alone. After attempting to gag myself into vomiting a few times in hopes of relieving myself somewhat I looked into the mirror and saw that I was me, truly, not some other person, and suddenly I sobered. I walk into the living room and smoke a cigarette while trying to accurately relate my experience to Boob. The next morning we ate the mushrooms with the intention of playing a two-player role-playing game while tripping. No more than a half an hour in and I was no longer cognitive. I had absolutely no idea what we were doing or what in the hell the point of any of it was, so I stopped playing and we began to watch a television show. Immediately I recognized the embossed quality of the picture from the last time I had ingested psilocybin whereat myself and a good friend of mine sat here all night laughing hysterically at a British television show about survivors of an Earthly holocaust rebuilding humanity on a barren planet, and I suspected that I would experience the same type of trip as then, mild and unproductive. I was wrong. Within an hour or so the entire room had taken on this very distant quality, like the walls of an aquarium, right there, yet so far a way, and the objects in my environment were floating on a tide as though the ocean has swept into the room and overtaken things. The cat was being a grouch in the corner and I was finding this all very amusing and enthusing until...I find myself awakening to the realization that Boob and I had been sitting here doing all of this together for ages, forever even. It was like we were the first two people in the Garden of Eden waiting throughout eternity for each other to wake up from this crazy dream that we’ve been having. I felt as though he knew every intimate detail of my life, and in this nakedness I felt ashamed and scared. I felt as though I needed to retreat. I couldn’t bring myself to embrace the extreme unity of this relationship. I could not face this reconciliation, yet. I had to run away and hide in waiting. I felt so stupid that I had been doing this for so long. The whole world knew as well. Everyone that had ever been was pointing and laughing at me because I created this insane illusion to hide myself from my closest friend. A voice is telling me to get up. At first it seems like a motivator telling me to get up and make a better life for myself, create a better me, but then it begins to twist and turn, seeming more like a first-responder finding my body on the ground and begging me to be alright. I begin to think that maybe I really have been in some horrible accident and this is someone trying to revive me. “Get up! You have to get up!” I open my eyes to find that it is indeed a person speaking to an unconscious body, on the television. “Damn, that was freaky.” I tell Boob who is hiding under a blanket on the couch. We both come to and decide to take another shot at playing the video game.We run our characters in circles and stare at the clouds laughing and exclaiming how very awesome everything looks for about fifteen minutes before throwing our controllers to the floor and laughing at them as well. I feel as if I am at the peak of something now, just close enough to reach higher, and so I suggest taking another hit of the DMT. Of course my brother isn’t into it (I think he’s afraid), but I don’t let that deter me and I take a hit of what remains in the pipe from yesterday. It greatly enhances the trip but does little else, nothing worth mentioning here at least. Later on that night I take another hit with a very good friend of mine who cannot partake of other drugs due to enforced legal parameters, and we got high together, that was about the gist of it. It was a very fun night, but nothing exceptional beyond what I’ve already mentioned.At any rate, disappointed with not having returned to the fantastic museum the night before I waited until early in the morning the next day to try one last time, as our resources had grown slim and my brother hadn’t taken his chance yet. I could remember distinctly having felt as though I were fighting the trip the first time and that I needed to relax in order to experience it fully. It just so happened that the wine had been left over from the first night and all seemed to be perfectly aligned. I drank the wine slowly as I watched videos on the internet of people relating their own experiences with the drug in order to build myself up to the moment. It was an extremely beautiful young lady that described, to the best of her abilities, having seen angels in her visions that finally pushed me over the edge, and I packed up probably a little more than I should have. I took a long, slow drag of the pipe and immediately I recognized having made the same mistake again.Now, I cannot fully remember what happened here as of yet, but I can tell you that I was scared beyond my wits upon awakening from it. I recall having become a two-dimensional black and white zigzag pattern and remaining that way for quite some time. I felt as though others were watching from somewhere, though from where I could not tell, as I was existing in a two-dimensional universe. I remember a gigantic face, somewhere. A woman’s face, made of rainbow colors. She was watching me, and it seemed as though she had always been watching me but I simply had not noticed until now. Though she seemed complacent, I felt as though she was happy that I had recognized her. During the episode I lost consciousness at some point and had very vivid dreams wherein my brother failed to relate to me his experiences with DMT several times over the course of a full week’s worth of time, even though he had not even really tried it yet, after which I awakened to my brother getting up very early in the morning which led me to believe that I had skipped a day and that we had to go to work immediately, which scared me quite a bit. All in all, it was a seemingly eventless experience, but I feel that the insights are apparent, and I am extremely grateful to have been a part of it. Until next time...

This report is written in three voices with some amount of overlap in events.PLAN:Each person is to take 2 hits of LSD followed by 1 pill of MDMA approximately 3.5 hrs thereafter.SET & SETTING:B'S VOICE:I'd been curious about candy flipping for a number of years, but the opportunity to try the mythic combo had always eluded me.One fine day in May, however, a lovely series of rather serendipitous events afforded me the chance to procure enough LSD and MDMA for myself and two others.   I related my find to a couple of wonderful friends who live out of town.  They expressed interest in trying the combination, and so that weekend I left Brooklyn for West Philadelphia.  I was somewhat aware that this combination may have a propensity for precipitating ++++-type experiences.It's worth noting that I was involved in a rather traumatic bicycle accident about four weeks prior, which resulted in a broken clavicle and some nasty scarring.  I was mostly healed, but my skin was still pink around the wounds, and my shoulder still ached, though lightly.  In retrospect, I think that the psychological and physical impact of my accident had some effect on my experience.I arrived in Philly on Friday evening and met H and E for dinner and a couple glasses of sangria.  We fleshed out our plans for the following day and chatted a bit about our expectations.  My sleep that night was somewhat restless.  We knew we were in for a ride.The next morning we shared breakfast.  I ate lightly.E's house is situated in West Philadelphia.  It is large, clean, and comfortable.  We were alone for the duration of the experience, and had collected a few little toys for the impending trip:  A tape recorder, guitar, sketchbook, markers, two stereos in separate parts of the house, and a large selection of music.We each took two hits of LSD at 10:30 AM, about two hours after breakfast.Within 15-20 minutes I felt the LSD making itself known.  My muscles trembled lightly, my breathing became deeper, I felt less talkative and somewhat anxious.  I slowly paced around the house, feeling the twinges of energy move through my limbs.  I remember chatting a little bit with my companions at this point, but I was more wrapped up in the rather unpleasant effects of the drug.  Coming up is always difficult for me. H'S VOICE:If, as B suggested at the outset, the LSD would make me anxious, I decided to quell the anxiety with tricks I've used before.  I focused on the guitar.  It makes time pass more quickly and allows me to forget myself. Only five, ten minutes in, I felt it.  Some quivering in my wrist, and playing guitar (remembering chords and/or changing chord positions) became increasingly difficult as the seconds crawled forward.  I mentioned nothing at first to B and E but in my head I said: Damn.  This shit works fast! I am about two or three inches in at this point and looking for non-verbal confirmation from either B or E.  [Enter Trope Number One: fear of being alone.]  E is slightly more energetic, and B is quiet. I have no sense that they are feeling what I am.  We decide to go to the store to pick up batteries for the tape recorder.  Nervous. I snip a little at E, make fun of a neighbour, and laugh awkwardly at B's jokes.  Still nervous.  Previous experience with situations involving LSD return briefly and remind me that the beginning of a trip can set the tone for the entire thing.  [Enter Trope Number 2: Drug Experience of the Present Through the Lens of the Past.]  I would like to be more calm but the anxiety only feeds off itself.  The green of the trees is startling.  My stomach is feeling strange. We walk inside the store.  I remember also how much easier it is to 'see' the effects of coming-up indoors (a house, store, wherever)  Our footsteps cause a mirror on the wall to shudder slightly.  Or does it?  The mirror is likely moving only inside my eyes.  At the counter I look at B.  His pupils are dilated.  Is he feeling what I'm feeling?  Probably.  Yes.  Get.  Home.  Now. We get home and quickly put the batteries into the recorder 'before it's too late,' and make our first verbal entry on the tape.  We are all officially 'feeling it' at this point.B'S VOICE:The effects were continuing to build, but I was feeling a bit less anxious.  We decided to take a walk to a nearby park.  H grabbed a backpack, a couple of bottles of water, and we were out the door.  As we turned the corner, I noticed a voice in the back of my head suggesting that perhaps it was in my best interest to turn around, head home, take cover.  The park was crowded when we arrived.  I felt exposed.  I sat in the grass for a few short minutes before deciding to concede to that quiet voice in my head.  We walked back, meandering over the cracked sidewalks, broken glass, hastily discarded trash.H'S VOICE:B was insistent on bringing bananas.  I decided this was either because some chemical in bananas intensified the effects of LSD (and B knew this) or because we were going 'adventuring', no adventure being complete without 'provisions.'  Clearly, we weren't going to actually eat the bananas.  If my stomach was in knots at this point, so must be B's. [B's Note: It was because we were adventuring!]On the walk I stumble once, maybe twice.  Did anyone notice?  I share B's anxiety.  We are not drunk, we are on drugs!  Everyday people not on drugs are passing us, perhaps wondering why our eyes are so big.  E asks to hold my hand.  Yes; my anxiety makes me feel especially distant, but then his hand feels very grounding and warm and safe.  I feel bad for B, travelling alone up ahead, our fearless, lonesome leader.  [Enter H Trope No. 3: Feeling Guilty that B Might Be Experiencing Third Wheel Feelings]B'S VOICE:Walking back, the birds sang a chorus with each voice perfectly focused.  I wasn't able to concentrate on any particular sound or call, but neither was doing so a necessity -- I was able to evenly divide my attention to each song and process them all in my head simultaneously.  A sort of reverse-cocktail-party effect.  How novel!It was nearing 1:00 PM by this point. The effects of the LSD were still escalating, but I felt that the physical effects were smoothing out as my body adjusted my new chemistry.   We went to E's bedroom, where H & E sprawled on the bed and I sat on a chair.  H picked up the guitar.  She played while E & I sang along to a few songs.  Singing felt fantastic.  I noodled around with the guitar for a while and eyed the six little blue pills that we had planned to take.H & I commented on how our skin changes whenever we trip.  My hands age.  They appear veiny, wrinkled, boney, weak, arthritic.  I worried about what it will be like to be older, and how I'll manage to come to terms with aging.  I feel reasonably clear-headed, but things are visually rather, uh, impressive. H'S VOICE:What I saw in E's room: My skin 'aging' in and out, or at least the dark parts of my hand (shadows in the crevices, darker parts of skin) pulsing darker, then lighter.  The glow of the painting of the boat, the incredible blue of the sea there.  The ship 'coming towards' me, the soft billowing and white light of the curtains, watery music: it fed into the nautical theme I felt on and off all day.  The painting of the girl with blue hair on the wall, her hair reaching up and out of her head, then coming back down, some very pleasant Medusa hair.  Technicolor patterns on my skin, like moving tattoos or the script of a strange, Arabic-like language.  White light changing to a rose color, to a green, then blue, constantly in flux, like rainbow blood coursing through the vessels of what makes up the unseen of the world.  A small fresh scar on my arm, glowing bright, then dark red.  Also the hairs on my arm arching up and out, then back towards my skin again (like the Medusa hair, but on a smaller scale).There were moments when I wasn't sure if I was asleep and half-dreaming, or awake.  Falling into the bed, then rising out when, slightly startled by the feeling, I darted my eyes open.  Touching doors that I might have seen in dreams.  Was the wall that protected the two worlds being broken down?  The dream world - the one that is always functioning subconsciously - and the world of mundanity, where we must reason and follow rules.  I believe there are protective boundaries created by nature to keep us humans safe, but a little more permeability just like this would be nice sometimes.  B'S VOICE:1:30 rolls around and we each swallow one pill.  I take one or two small hits of marijuana from my bowl.E'S VOICE:Several themes occurred again and again: Energy, love, community.  As I began to climb on the LSD, I felt excited mostly, then energetic.  A minute behind B, I remember feeling anxious only briefly.  The climb, I had already been assured, is mildly unpleasant for many.  I would have to agree, and for a bit I found myself moved to separate from the group.  When my mental state changes, I have noticed an increasing propensity to being alone.  I felt sad, the failure of the back yard, the failure of the park, unable to provide my friends a good close place to rest our heads and enjoy our freedom.  I felt more alien and out of place then liberated.  But as it straightened out - and before the pill kicked in -  I began to notice the wonderful measures of light linking from object to object.  Enjoyable patterns emerged, I felt child like, immersed in colors; any subject with in itself no longer important, but the patterns that made up the subject intrigued and tantalized (i.e. the ink and colors of Calvin & Hobbes, the visuals of the Of Montreal - Satanic Panic in the Attic poster, the faint light coming through the window)  Novelty breeds pleasure, happiness, fascination.  I needed to see where this would take me.B'S VOICE:Shortly after taking the pill, E moved downstairs to be by himself.  H & I sprawled out on the bed and chat a bit, but we mostly stay quiet to explore this novel headspace and await the effects of the MDMA.As the minutes pass, I notice additional alerts.  A gentle wave of warmth and euphoria washes over me, and the visual characteristics become sharper, more electric.  Rainbow-static-vortexes wash over the ceiling.I look at H. H looks back.  Her expression is unmistakable and we each know what the other is feeling.We rush downstairs.'E!  The MDMA works!' E was laying on the sofa in the living room.  We greet him and tell him that we are both feeling the effects of the MDMA and that it is pretty fantastic.E'S VOICE:It is a faint rush, a sudden twinge of worry that too much has been downed that suddenly bursts into overwhelming joy and understanding that all is right in the world.  In the space in between there is a falling away.  The eyes close and the world drops - or more accurately, I slipped from the world, knowing full well it was there but that its rules no longer applied to me and my mind was free to explore at will.  With my eyes closed, the patterns in my 'sight' had intensified far beyond a mere hour earlier and as I opened them the world was not there but simply the fractals of light flowing through beautiful dark empty air.  I double checked, needing to make sure my eyes were open - they were.  I saw what I saw with my eyes open as I would like one fully asleep in a dream.  I double checked for extra dimensional creatures.  Silly perhaps, but I called out to them having heard B mention them from DMT experiences.  I wanted them to be there, but it was only my own voice that rang back at me as I mentally announced my presence and invited others to come join.The patterns began to be replaced - how long did it take? Not more than ten or fifteen minutes I would guess - by the euphoria and joy of love.  All the rough edges were completely gone, smoothed out into an angelic serenity.  The room had returned to it's normal state, furniture intact, me physically laying on the couch.  I felt very connected to H & B and missed them.  As I moved to join them they came down the stairs.'E! The MDMA works!' said B.  We hung out; it's all a bit blurry in my mind, though wonderful.  I enjoyed a few more minutes to myself.  At some point H and I went upstairs to my room to explore physically, but we wound up mostly just talking in between kisses.  We spoke honestly and openly about our relationships, the wonderful stuff along with the pressures we felt we faced.  We started to miss B and we also suspected - somewhat accurately I believe - that if we were to go down the path of intimacy too far we might never come back.  We made a few notes into the recorder.  I remember how amazingly lucid I felt even with the joy of the MDMA running through me.  A fascinating combination of the openness of alcohol but remaining completely articulate though certainly very high.H'S VOICE:I remember looking out the window and thinking, 'We can't leave now, we're too effed up.'  I felt trapped.  The green of the trees looked so organic and inviting (MDMA for me had briefly kicked in, then retreated slightly, I think) but I wasn't allowed to go outside and enjoy them.  I wondered to myself if this is what crazy people feel, an interior experience so bizarre when described, it's best to keep it to oneself and avoid contact.  Likely a picturesque moment with my hand lifted to keep the curtain to the side, watching the outdoors with furrowed brow.  I related the sentiment to B.  But then suddenly, intensity took him and, even for me, the music grew incredible.I really loved how lucid we sound on the tape recording.  I love how the mind is clear and unfettered by insecurities and 'ummms' and 'uh, well...' and so on.  To speak was to explain honestly.  No games, minds open, sentiments flowing freely within the friendship triangle of E-H-B, B-H-E.B's VOICE:The floor was rippling bit.  The rugs shifted.  The curtains moved in the breeze despite the closed windows.  I sat on a rug in an alcove near the front of the house and closed my eyes.  The clarity of thought was astounding; my every thought resounded in a single voice instead of the usual cacophonous choir of doubts and contradictions.  And if I wanted to quiet my mind entirely, I could do so at will.  This deep state of meditation was intense to the point that it was nearly frightening.  It was too easy to simply forget that I existed in the physical world at all.  Vibrant greens and blacks filled the vast void behind my eyelids.  I opened my eyes when a tentacled thing cut its way through my visions and pushed the fractals aside like curtains.  It was all a bit much.I found H in the dining area.  We sat across the room from one another, in absolute awe of the music.  Mum - Finally We Are No One was playing through the stereo.  H suggested we try to sing, so we sang along with the music and it felt like light was coming out of my chest and meeting with the light coming out of her to mingle and harmonize in the air between us.  I could visualize the waveforms.  I was amazed.H and I grabbed a tape recorder with the intention to record our singing, but quickly forgot about doing so.  The boundaries between self and non-self were rapidly crumbling and I felt that an uncontainable well of bliss / empathy / love / unity / oneness was erupting inside of me.  The empathogenic qualities of the MDxx merged with with the ego-destroying effects of the LSD and the result was this state of feeling empathy and love for everything in the universe.  This was the ++++ experience I'd accidentally stumbled across several years prior.  I was there again.  It was more than I could take, and I was utterly overwhelmed with gratitude for existing at all, for having the opportunity to experience the beauty of existence, to know what it was just to be here, anywhere, to exist at all was a gift that I did not deserve and could never repay.  H and I hit record on the tape recorder.You can hear me get a bit choked up.I felt more sober than sobriety, everything was more real than it ever was before.  I remember picking up a pen and seeing the electric trails follow my hand, words writing themselves without a writer, energy flowing out of me and into me, everything completely at one with everything else.  I remember feeling that love of this profound magnitude must be at least the sum total of the experience of having a child, to feel love to have made a thing that you would happily -- happily -- give your life to.I'm not sure for how long the plus-four part of this experience lasted, but at this point things went downhill a bit.E & H expressed a desire to explore each other, and I agreed that they should.  This was fine with me and I felt happy for them as they departed for E's bedroom.  I moved to the sofa.  I started thinking of my girlfriend in Brooklyn, someone I had known for a long time but had only recently become sexually involved with.  I watched myself find my cell phone, turn it on, and call her.She picked up.  I told her that I loved her.  I had never told her this before. The fact of the matter was that I did love her, but also that this was a profoundly inappropriate time to be saying so.  I told her I had taken two hits of LSD and one tab of MDMA.  I very quickly realized what I had done and felt extremely embarrassed.  Before we said goodbye, she told me to take it easy and told me that the last time I took LSD it seemed to last a very long time... 'seemed like it never ended,' I think were her exact words.  Things really took a negative turn here.E'S VOICE:We return.  B had called his girlfriend and told her he loved her for the first time.  Though it appears this is harmless in retrospect, at the time it couldn't help but weigh on our minds.  It was not a good decision, but on the other hand what's done is done and there are many many worse things to say to someone.  We move on, though it is an added concept that is filled in the back of my head.There is music played, mostly H, sometimes B, some singing.  The Mountain Goats mainly.  I've already forgotten which song specifically - someone list here if remembered.  [H's Note: The name of the song is 'Linda Blair Was Born Innocent'.]At one point B says he understands why these drugs are illegal.  The more time I have to reflect on that idea and on my own emotional state, I'm not so sure.  It in fact strikes me that if one could modify these drugs so that they were much like cigarettes  -- harmful over the course of a life time and intensely addictive -- a government could easily control an entire population, enslaving it in much the same way as in Brave New World.  As I walked through the rain today, I was forced to ask myself:  If I was able to access that mindstate as easily as picking up a pack of cigarettes after a day's work, would I choose, quite voluntarily, to become a slave?  It's a scary thought, and it makes me worry about the joy of what we have felt.  Perhaps it's my personality, but after several days of total sobriety I can't deny that I miss it and want to repeat it -- at times almost urgently.  It is controllable, completely, but the desire is there and I suspect will remain until time works its magic and the memories fade.B'S VOICE:Time was already moving strangely.  I wasn't sure what had happened already and what hadn't happened yet, which is an awkward way of saying that time seemed to be moving backwards and forwards.  I remembered that I had taken LSD at least ten days prior. I could not, however, figure out what happened in the intervening ten days.  With what my girlfriend said on the phone about it lasting a long time, I started thinking that I had taken LSD ten days ago and never come down, that I was still high... and how long had I been in Philadelphia, anyway?  Wait.  How old was I?  How long has this been going on?I got worried.E and H returned and we all went to E's bedroom together.  I noodled with the guitar, but I didn't really know what I was doing.  E or H asked me how long I had been playing, but I didn't understand how I was supposed to interpret the question:  A while.  Never.  Presently.  I remained mute and shifted my head side-to-side and shrugged.  There were more questions.  Words simply escaped me.  I was not sure if I was usually able to speak...  And who were E and H and how long had I known them?  Why were they asking me all of these questions?  Were they trying to coax words out of me?  And again, what happened in the intervening ten since I last took LSD?I got paranoid.I believed -- and I use the word 'believe' in a very loose sense, because these beliefs were qualitatively different from other beliefs -- that E & H were sort of paternal figures for me.  I wasn't sure how old I was, but I seemed to think that I was quite young and generally incapable of speaking, and that E & H were trying to help me learn to speak.  But for all of their questions, I either had no opinion, or no words, or believed that there was a 'correct' answer and that I was being 'tested.'  The idea of being tested frightened me.  I noodled with the guitar and tried strumming certain chords in order to try to convey what I was feeling.  It was a relief to have the guitar as a sort of nonverbal outlet.And I could sing.  H played the guitar and I sang along a bit.  This felt good and was indeed very grounding, but real verbal communication was too much.  In short, I was frightened and confused, did not know where I existed in space or time, and couldn't comprehend how the events of the previous week led up to me being in Philadelphia.  Additionally, I had no idea how long I had been high.  It could have been years.  I had no reference points.  I was lost.I tumbled through various delusions in my own head about who E & H were, who I was, why we were together in this place, and how long we'd been here.  My broken clavicle no longer ached, and so I thought I was an opiate addict since a drug had taken away the pain.  I was asked to read a comic, and so I thought I was illiterate.  When I was coaxed into answering simple questions, I thought I was mute.  I was provided with water and so I believed that I only drank water and didn't eat food.  I experienced a complex delusion of alcoholism, wherein my concepts of alcohol and water became interchangeable, and I believed that my perception of the liquids was incorrect, and that whatever procedure I was presently being made subject to was in order to cure my alcoholism.  I saw the scars on my body from my recent bicycle accident and worried that I had inflicted this harm on myself intentionally.  I remembered the accident.  Had I crashed on purpose?  The thought was (and upon reflection, still is) terrifying.  I knew that there was something very wrong with me, and that we were conducting an intensive psychoanalysis that forced me to delve into my subconscious mind and into this world I was inhabiting but couldn't understand.  Most of all, I felt like I was a child and that E and H were here to try to help me.Eventually, the effects began to wind down, my delusions ceased, the fear subsided.  I regained the ability to speak.  I was no longer a child.  And despite it going against the plan, I kind of wanted another one of those blue pills.E'S VOICE:This intimacy with others lasts and stays powerful.  Though we are coming down, I still feel a sense of closeness and relief to have touched on something so beautiful.  Towards the end we are lying on my bed.  B suggests doing a second one.  We agree.  Later after I have snorted a part of a pill - a perfect definition of the word unpleasant or simply foul - off my 'learn guitar' book I realize that I do not want more of this, that it is time to even out a bit.  It is perhaps a mistake to be the odd man out as B & H both finish their other pills.  I am coming down and it is happening fast and hard.  Too quick for me to even realize until it is too late, I feel myself exposed, overly so, despite one being my lover and the other a long time friend and confidant.  As they are rising again, to a less intense degree, I am shutting them out and losing myself in my own mind.  For a while I cannot speak except to offer the occasional reassurance that I'm fine and well, which is true. I feel jealous of their state but also relieved to be in my own head again.  For a while I am happy to follow them in body while my mind begins to categorize, sort, search, and make sense of all that has happened to it.  I feel awkward but not terrible.  B and H are both very kind to me as I slip further and further out of it.  I am not use to such intensity nor did I realize how much I would like it.  I feel the need to pull back, a feeling that remains for several hours.H'S VOICE:At some point, B and I discussed how having experiences like this with other people [especially when a little younger than now] opens a door that may or may not be ready to open.  Deep connections are made.  They remain, though time passes and people grow apart.  A giant hole in space opens, a golden marble is accidentally dropped inside: then the hole closes, the point of gold (the bond) remaining.  I had friends and relationships like this in college.  I don't necessarily regret them, but they certainly weren't naturally deep -- the opening of the senses through drugs made them pre-emptively intense, and permitted them to exist longer than they ought to have.E'S VOICE:While I'm spacey, we head out to H's place to change the environment and hang out with her cat.  I stay quiet and withdrawn; once again it does not come from a hostile place but the need to be emotionally alone for a bit.  I don't remember too many details: B & H left to smoke cigarettes, I stayed, we all went out to the front porch to enjoy the cool night air, and finally headed back to my place.  We stopped by Dock Street first to fill up a Growler with beer.  B and I hang out, he offers to talk.  I assure him I am fine.  After we go home, they pour some beers and I head upstairs.  I don't have any beer -- my abstinence here turns out to be a fantastically terrible choice.In my room with the door locked I am finally alone and face many personal demons -- items that for now will stay private.  I light some candles and turn on music, working my way through these very sudden and very strong feelings.  They come in waves, exploding and retreating.  B & H both stop in to comfort.  I push them away for a while longer.  H finally comes in, but I have no words for her at the moment.  I am disconnected and lost.  She is sad - I am empty.  I go downstairs for a drink and to see my roomies.  I down three shots of frozen vodka and a lager Black & Tan.  Ten minutes later the alcohol is working its way through my system and rapidly cutting away the emptiness.  Warmth and endearment begin to set in, along with a sense of empowerment.  No longer a victim of circumstance, I'm able to finally pull myself together enough to relate to others again.  I'm impressed by the power of the booze, it really made me feel okay.  H and I talk a great deal.  Eventually I swing by B who is near asleep to offer my apology for being so far away.  Laid back, he appears calm about the whole situation.  With H I smoke the best tasting cigarette of my life -= an unfiltered.  D'oh.  I quit over a year ago.  Totally worth it though.  Then, sleep?  I'm not sure if there was any intervening events, the last one I really remember is smoking that cigarette.  Possibly we drank some more beer, but then off to bed for a much needed sleep.SIX DAYS LATER:B:Sunday and Monday were been rough, largely dominated by an unspecific sort of anxiety, an antsy boredom to do something/anything.  By Tuesday, things had levelled off and I was left with a fantastic after-glow, general feeling of confidence, a feeling that I had a deep understanding of myself.  I'm not afraid to offer advice or speak confidently.  Everything feels right and good.   I feel as though my life had previously been riding on rails, and that a possibility for dramatic change for my future has opened.  This doesn't feel entirely comfortable.  I'd say that my life in the months prior to this experience were 'comfortable.'  Now I feel like I'm on a mission.  It's good.I would be curious to repeat this with bk-MDMA instead of the mystery street pills I'd acquired.  I think the more grounded character of bk-MDMA would be a fantastic complement for using LSD in this sort of setting.  I would also probably lower the LSD dosage to 1 hit.  I was overwhelmed.  I would also keep valium on hand, and would probably abstain from smoking marijuana, at least until things have pretty much tapered off.Incidentally, I have not felt the desire to drink alcohol since this experience. H:This past week I have had very little urge to drink - I have had a great urge to stay sharp and busy.  I've felt great warmth for my family and friends but my dreams are often nightmares, or very vivid and desperate.  Things that give me joy are particularly joyful: today my bike ride to work stimulated just like the old days.  I can't help but sense, however, that my engagement with these elements of my life is a willful distraction.  From what, though?  And is this mere residual gratitude from the drug or a real change?  Some pockets of emptiness will strike me at moments.  Overall, however, I feel more confident & interested in engaging strangers---something I don't typically do with consistency.  I am struck also by the lack of art in my life, something B and I discussed in E's room after our peak.  A thing I ought to remedy, but not sure how. I am a 25 year old gay male living in London. Throughout my childhood I suffered severe emotional abuse at the hands of my parents and sometimes physical abuse in the form of a thick leather belt with a big metal bolt on it whilst naked. As a result I was severely screwed up for my entire childhood, which was made much worse as I made no friends and spent my entire time at school being cruelly reminded of the fact I had no friends by the vast majority of people at school. I also gambled excessively on fruit machines, again starting at age 13, and went cottaging in public toilets from age 14. Thankfully I was never raped. I became severely depressed, suffered from severe anxiety and at age 13 I began abusing alcohol in quantities a professional adult pisshead would consider to be excessive. I had very little money so I began to brew my own very strong alcohol in secret, which thanks to the crazy taxes on drinking we have in the UK, reduced the cost of my drinking by as much as 90%. Despite my excesses I was determined to succeed at school so I could escape by going to a good university, and as a very intelligent guy I did extremely well in my exams. Unfortunately I was not emotionally ready for the real world as I was about to find out. I drank like a fish whilst studying maths at university. I say studying, but this is a gross distortion of the truth as I did nothing but drink. I also made friends with 2 other people through the student bridge club who did this as well. I barely made it through my degree and when I graduated in 2003 I had no intention of looking for work because that wasn't drinking. It is now 2007. I feel it is relevant to briefly mention other medications I have taken before continuing. I took Cipralex (escitalopram) for 4 days and experienced my depressive symptoms becoming so much worse I tried to kill myself with alcohol and painkillers. The hospital responded my referring me for counselling (I have been to endless therapists in my history and have derived no benefit whatsoever from any of them) and by doubling my dose of Cipralex. I couldn't believe I was explaining that the drug did this and their 'listening people' responded by doubling the dose - this is why I hate counsellors. I am now prescribed Effexor but I don't take it, I just smile and say OK so I can continue getting doctor's notes and hence get benefits. I also did MDMA in moderation (previously unheard of for me) for 2 years, and I feel the connection to others and love of myself and others the experience gave me saved my life. Anyway, I quit drinking on New Year's Day 2007. However alcohol is so addictive for me that I managed 4 days. At which point my mind was going through absolute hell and I wanted to die, so on the 5th day I resumed drinking for 6 days. At some point I decided I would like to be prescribed antabuse so that if I drank it would make me ill, and naltrexone to block out cravings for alcohol, and I called my doctor. When I went to see him he referred me to a substance misuse specialist and this person point blank refused to prescribe these drugs. He informed me that binge drinking was 'part of British culture' and not to worry. For once I stood up for myself and argued with him for an hour and a half that my problem was serious, but (quote from South Park) 'naturally, we're not listening'. I woke up on the 11th and realised I had drunk a litre of gin the previous day, then moved onto several beers and had gambled away £450 on the internet, and that the medical people had no intention of helping me. I managed to quit again for 4 days before once again hell was raging in my mind and I was about to go to the off licence. However this time I thought to myself 'maybe G can help'. I had been using G non-excessively for 6 months, although I had sometimes drunk it with alcohol. I intuitively thought this was a bad idea, but I was desperate, what else could I do?And so I come to the plus and minus sides of G. The plus side is that I managed 2 months with no alcohol, and still to this day (it's April 29) I only use alcohol socially, meaning in pubs and clubs on average 2 to 3 nights a week. I never drink alone any more. It has to be said that this is a huge advantage of GBL, and one that I absolutely needed. However, there are also big downsides too. Early on in using G, I required about 1.8ml. This dose produced social lubrication and made me feel more sexual. Also as an intoxicant it lacks the hangover and extreme mental fogginess that pervades my mind when drinking to excess. As a high it enhanced my emotions in a positive way rather than just blotting them out. Also, there is still some remote sanity in our laws on GBL so it is legal here and it's therefore easy to obtain pure GBL over the internet. Obviously if it were not I would have to pay more for an unknown strength hit, and thus it would be more dangerous. However there are downsides too. I have passed out in public occasionally - this is inevitable if you're using regularly. Now here we have the National Health Service. Britons love to moan about the service however I don't - because I have ended up in hospital due to alcohol quite a number of occasions and also once due to G. Ending up in hospital due to G is not something that worries me because the service is free, but I'm aware that doing this once in a place like the States could equal a huge hospital bill and so in other places this does actually matter. If you use G regularly when out it is very likely that this will happen to you as it could have happened to me other times as well. Also, I now require 2.3ml to experience any real effects, and that's on an empty stomach dose. I will also re-dose with half this dose after about an hour as it has a very short half life. I use every day I'm not drinking, although I don't dose up constantly; if I have something to do or I need to go out I won't take any. I am concerned because I know that my required dose and frequency of dose are likely to continue to rise, but there again the alternative of constant drinking is so unappealing I choose to ignore this problem. Also my shoulder blades have become quite painful so for example, a deep breath hurts mildly. Also, I have broken stuff in my flat thanks to stumbling around on G, and I have also fallen asleep stood up and then fallen over and hit my head and elbows, and also woken up with unexplained bruises on my legs and arms after too much G. In addition the effects of the G are not what they once were. 1.8ml used to be mild, relaxing and pleasant (to make a point about getting the dosage right, 2ml would equal face in dinner snoring). Now 2.3ml doesn't do all that much beyond remove the desire for alcohol whereas 2.5 makes me feel more messed up than relaxed and happy. 2.7 makes me feel very messed up in a way I don't enjoy (a bit like poppers do).  Any more will knock me out. Also when I used to sleep on G, I would sleep for about 4 hours. Now if it's time for sleep anyway I will sleep for about 4 before taking more to get a full nights sleep. But if I find I don't need the sleep that much I'll only sleep for an hour and then need as much as 3ml to get another couple of hours. My flatmate has also got up for work in the morning and found me passed out in random places, but luckily he doesn't seem to mind me being a twat (he's probably used to seeing me drunk).Overall I would say that if one has an addictive personality then maybe it's best to avoid G. I'm not really sure because I could easily go back to just drinking but I see that as a worse habit and so I just don't want to. On the other hand, if one has no addictions beforehand I could see G causing one. I have come to appreciate that it's not an alcohol addiction, or a G addiction that I have, but the symptoms of my mental illness that give me a predisposition to liking sedating intoxicants. I won't be trying any new ones though because, for example, I can see how something like heroin would destroy me and I can maintain myself with what I have. I am also engaging with the job centre these days and can see that by slowly re-introducing myself to people at large and working towards full time work I will one day be able to leave GBL behind. With alcohol, I would never have achieved this more positive state of thinking because when you are affected by problem drinking, both as the user and someone who knows one, it is a truly vicious and destructive habit. G is not. T = 0: 2 margaritas, delicious T = 1 hrs: 1 bump (~25 mgs) ketamine (note: stupid given previous substance)T = 3 hrs: ~2.5 ml (concentrated to saturation) 1,4-butanediol (note: stupid given previous substance)T = 6 hrs: ~1.5 ml 1,4-butanediol (same stuff, same stupid comment)I was saying this to just about everyone that would listen the next morning: I am not hardcore. I have lost my deep dive certification. I’ve been demoted to drugie newbie status along with cold medicine aficionados and people who wander around the playa asking strangers if they have any “liquid x” for sale. I was once hard core, I am no longer.The evening started out well enough with a heavy dinner of rice and seafood washed down with a healthy dose of margaritas (hornitos, orally administered). Later, on there was a request from others in our group for a little bit of k before the walk to a party at a friend’s house and not wanting to be left out, I took a bit. It was fun briefly followed by a bit of stumbling and then the wishing it would go away, which it did.After waiting until I didn’t feel any effects from the evening's previous indiscretions, I downed a bit of B in fruit juice over about 30 minutes (I drink slowly) and everything was _peachy_ where peachy includes some kissing, some talking, etc. Then my girlfriend (who was taking the same things at similar times and doses) passed out for exactly 2 hours. She was completely unwakable and unresponsive to anything.  After we verified a strong pulse and healthy breathing, and laid her out on a bed in a dignified and attractive manner, we proceeded to continue to have our little get-together in the bedroom while periodically admiring her beauty and noting her continued healthy pulse and breath.Any intelligent person would have stopped there. Called it a night and switched to some nice mint tea (decaf, orally administered). Not me, I was having a grand time and once my girlfriend woke up again I didn’t want to stop my g-like drunkenness so I poured myself another glass of floor cleaner. This is when the trouble started. There was some spinning at first, then the incoherent (and horny) babbling, then the nausea set in and I went to the bathroom to deal with any resulting unpleasantness.I woke up exactly two hours later, naked, with my girlfriend sitting next to me, and a strong desire to puke. This I did, for the following two hours or so. Every time I felt like I was done and attempted to stand, that turned out to be a horrible idea. Finally after a shower, sending my slightly puke-stained clothing through the wash, I was able to rejoin the party (still in progress) with a deep sense of shame at my foolishness. In my defense, I left alone the nitrous (this was causing the party to continue in spite of the prevailing morning conditions outside). I did learn a valuable lesson and will confine my activity to safe combinations like cocktails of AMT, datura, and paint thinner from now on (note: I'm joking, don't be like me kids, etc.).

Standard and extra special warnings apply kids, NEVER DO THIS.So the Sunday started as usual -- with a hangover! Just kidding folks, the day started out great. Plenty of sleep last night, Monday is a day off, Tuesday is an Australian public holiday, and after a week of wouldn't kick your dog out weather, the sun graced our faces during morning coffee and croissants on the back porch. For the record I am in mid thirties, male, 180cm/70kg, with about 20 years of experience with psychedelics, a byproduct of which is extremely high tolerance to MDxA type compounds. Surprisingly enough, I am also healthy and health conscious.The Soulmate, a professional musician and an artist of acclaim also had the long weekend fairly free, no mandatories, and although a non-participant in any of the forthcoming, or for that matter, any of my pharmaceutical activities, blessed me with her loving, courageous and very feminine presence. Did I mention beautiful?So after the morning coffee kicked in, augmented with 1000mg of l-phenylalanine, 1,600mg of Piracetam and 5mg L-Deprenyl (standard nootropics regimen, the remaining five or so neurons need all the help they can get), the sun still stubbornly shone through the gusts of clouds, and we realized there is no way of weaseling out of the working bee at the gardens. By this time it was 11:00 A.M. T 0:00 On our way out, I happened to glance at a copy of PIHKAL innocently open on the coffee table, right on some obscure chemical, Entry No. 33. From nowhere, the Psychedelic Spirit took possession, halting me midstep. Several large cones (this is what us Aussies call bong loads) of high quality local hydro mull mix were needed to calm the restless soul, yet the desire for alternate and altered perception remained. The solution became evident, I had to eat a Greenback - a very strong MDMA/MDA combo pill, tested, unusual in that it is dual-colored - green one half, white the other half, not dyed. A lazy-hazy ambulation to the gardens with the Soulmate talking about nothing and everything, touching her brown skin (she gets mistaken for Brazilian) and running my hands through her waist-long hair. T 0:15 Ah the working bee, the compost heap that needs a'choppin and the sun, and the AXE with which to chop, good grip yyeah, AARGH! As the typical effects of MDMA became pronounced, a brightening of the visual aspect and a general mood lift - I became Coner The Axe Wielding Barbarian on top of the compost heap, the roots and weeds didn't have a chance! Soon, with an axe in each hand, I devolved to a green goop-covered grinning, chopping madman, the bastard son of a thousand maniacs, or was that Freddy Krueger? Sweating under the hot sun, chopping away, scaring old ladies to be sure, feeling each muscle move in tandem, grrreat!T 1:45 By this point the compost heap was leveled, the blisters on both hands fully formed, and the effects of the Greenback were in need of augmentation. The Soulmate was resting in the sun, surprised at my manly, sweaty prowess (grin), and although both highly erotically charged, we were unable to take the opportunity, this being in a public place. alas, a swift walk home, several more cones, hmmm, there was sumethin-somethin missing. A synchronicitous occurrence -- approximately 8 mg of 2C-I, a substance unexplored but much researched, fell into my mouth, seemingly materializing right from the pages of the Shulgins' book. The taste was almost lacking but slightly off-bitter, not at all unpleasant at this experimental dose, washed down with apple juice. What the fuck are you doing? - asked my Internal Observer, but a check of vital signs and emotional-spatial landscape confirmed the set, setting, time and intention were correct for the upcoming adventure. T 2:00 A review of the morning's activities over some coneloads smoked to the background of Hallucinogen in Dub reasoned my way clear to chewing another Greenback, some cones to follow the well beaten path. By this time the effects of the initial MDMA dose were giving way to the push of MDA, which manifested as appearance of often described smoke-ring type peripheral visual effects and a strong Kundalini push from the lower shakras.T 2:30 The effects of the second Greenback are kicking in, back outdoors by the bay and the sky moves too fast to look at, I am crowing with the birds flying with them overhead in the thermals coming off the hot sand on the beach. Gardening again proves welcome relief for the MDA push, exercising muscles I never even knew I had. T 3:00 2C-I, Yes, there it is. Subtle energetic lift complemented by significant enhancement of visual acuity, a distinctly different phen signature, seems to begin blending well with the effects of the MDMA/MDA combo, with MDA the backbone, MDMA the nervous/sensory extension of the metasystem, and 2C-I providing introspective depth and coloration, the painter of emotions. Another effect of the 2C-I, it made me completely unaware of any somatic side effects usually associated w/ MDxA intake. No nausea, and when the 2C-I became pronounced, no nystagmus or jaw clenching until much later. In fact, the whole trip was very lucid, with no body load, perhaps aided by the L-Dprenyl and Piracetam, no distortions, confusion or fuzzyness.T 4:00 The sun is bright and the wind high, and by golly, so am I. Gliding my way through the crowded street in a quest for sunglasses, absolutely hopeless given my condition as I don't think they make frames large enough to cover the dilated pupils, becoming aware that everyone's faces had changed. Peoples' faces became masks, but not color-distorted, morphing and often scary masks of LSD / Psilocybin, rather the faces, or rather the expressions they wore became enhanced to the point that all of the person's life, emotional makeup and baggage, and even self perception, were mixed in proportion and stamped indelibly on their face, right now and at all times. At this point, the questions begin coming. What is the source of beauty that you seek? - asked the Internal Observer. Subjective Projection is not Objective Perception, or is this even the point? The visuals are becoming stronger. Emotions people tried to put on, the personalities they tried to project appeared fake and thin, veneer, gloss, like the glossy gray skin-tight T-shirt two sizes too small on an exceedingly muscle-bound bodybuilder who walked by, and made me laugh out loud. Almost as funny as a flock of dreadlocked and carefully cultivated crusty ferals perched on the grassy hill who appeared to be Trustafarians rather than Rastafarians. On the other hand, some people were stunningly good looking, and in many a case, regardless of their outward physical appearance. When the two, the inward and the outward combined, the synergetic perceptual effect was stunning, it was as if some people were karmically pure and shone with the light of Good Intention, for lack of better words, emanating their pure, beautiful energy, comfortable in their own space and purpose. This was seemingly much more than typical auras I can read under the influence. When I saw the Soulmate upon returning from the lost crusade, I understood the essence of Love, the pure joy of loving and being loved in return, unconditionally.T 5:00 Something about the righteous satisfaction of packing the perfect bowl of mull, not too big, not too small, the exhaled smoke is a rainbow cloud, the visuals from the 2C-I are definitely there, with surprisingly few somatic effects still. Pulse 85 -- high by 25, BP 120 / 60, normal. Another bowl was complemented by a fine cold Belgian lager which went down a treat, as well as helping get rid of the taste of another whole Greenback. Back outside and working away, feeling social as all getout, meeting people right and left, with apparently, no awareness of my changed condition, thank god for the sunglasses which were on my head all along. Conversation is no problem, hardly any distortion, empathic and understanding, attention span is great, and memory recall significantly enhanced, long forgotten references on tap.T 5:30 Fully tripping, lying on our backs on the grass, all senses enhanced almost to the point of being painful, especially the olfacatory and the visual, the grass recently mown smells of sunshine, every inch of ground seems to be covered with life of some sort awakening under the sun. I can almost feel the plants opening up to the warmth. The gorgeous, stunning, completely unpretentious Soulmate is feeding me a huge dripping golden mango, I laugh as I suck out the nectar lying on my back, juice and pulp running down my face, taste becoming colored, synaesthesia, here we come. Smells, usually enhanced by L-Deprenyl are magnified immensely, although none bordering on the offensive. Water divine, definite dehydration after working all day, blisters now burst with top layers of skin gone (remember to wear ya gloves when ya axe, dough!) but while visually amusing and disgusting to others caused no pain ... certainly the awareness of the damage was there, as was the sensation, although it was not perceived as pain, but just that, an awareness of damage. Nearby is a chicken coop, where we see a rooster, no a Cock consider a few prime chooks then, taking a good running start, jump on top of the fattest looking hen, while others ran away cackling, covering his hapless selection with his flapping wings (tracers) to prevent escape, making mad chicken noises all the while and doing what birds and bees do best, with tenacity and vigour to impress any Viagra salesman -- wow, such raw nature, I look at the Soulmate and she is laughing at me laughing at the chickens and places her body next to mine, her head on my chest.I feel her warmth and her waist-long hair smells of hay and sunshine and her smell which I love, now in colors, and we want to make love, but there are others, including young'un family members in vicinity; desire a hot knot of white energy at the spine, rising through the lower shakras and spreading through every skin cell, touch is in itself semi-orgasmic. Eyes closed, her words, spoken gently and not too often, are colored with emotion, I can see both melding into a visual thoughtform, each concept a geometrical figure of fractal complexity, unique as a snowflake, in brilliant hues of primary, yet un-Pantoned colors against a neon pastel background of gently shifting field patterns. Love shines as a tesseract lotus diamond through my whole being.T 8:00 back home after the sun on its way to meet the ocean becomes obscured by copper-tinged clouds, some cones and music. A shuffle through the CDs scattered everywhere, a few hit and misses, the misses being Sun Ra, some new school Israeli psytrance which proves too aggro, some dub which was too boring, with a Shponglization-Younger Brother a final temporary selection, which when cranked to pleasure levels prompted the poor Soulmate to drive the tired family members back to their abode.Alone with the music, subs at just before the neighbors come knocking levels, the cat absolutely freaked out jumping off walls, her eyes bigger than mine if possible, escapes to the balcony where she sits indignantly twitching the tip of her tail. The cat hates loud electronic music, she is a classical aficionado though. Oh well, she will have to bear for a bit as next up is a wicked mix of some guitar driven space trance off Guitars on Mushroom, and some Russian psy, which, of course, needs full amplification. Some definite ego expansion noted. Pulse 120 BP 130 / 70 getting higher than I like but within normal range. Online, reading no problem, music jamming visuals, connection not fast enough to keep up with my clicking, internet bores, reading is not fast enough, some agitation and peripheral amphetaminergic stimulation becoming noted. T 9:00 Disconnect, a short session of cones, load of laundry, washing dishes proves no respite from the forthcoming Comedown...Lay back, close eyes and chill to Backroom Beats 2 (Twisted) over another lager. Cat is back, laying on my chest, purring away as I scratch her cheeks. How cool is it to be a cat, with long soft fur, grace, agility, personality. Chilling with the cat, fully grokking as to why the Egyptians of yore chose to deify the feline. Coming down off the pills, the 2C-I still in effect, blood pressure normal but pulse around 140. An energy tremor, not a cramp passes through whole body. I want sex, but she is gone, oh frustration! T 10:00 Soulmate is back, wonders at my condition, which has apparently become pretty disheveled. Shower brings back memories of being a primordial water creature, feeling the impact of the spray, each drop on my skin.T 10:30 Just when the massage is blooming to the truly erotic, Glen Gould humming along to his unique Bach fugues on the piano, every cell afire with sensation, friends who were supposed to drop by some hours ago show up. Dough! They knew nothing of my intake, and conversation flowed easy over beers, cones, and for the abstinent ladies, a bit of amaretto on ice. 1mg Alprazolam ingested to ease peripheral tension, and pardon the expression, the priapic puptent in my pants. Pulse is fairly fast still, active visuals calming, mind at full throttle.T 11:30 Friends dearly depart and a brisk walk outside in the warm night holding hands with the one I love, haloes still around lights and headlights. We walk, sharing our thoughts and revelations of the day, I nuzzle her neck with my shaved head like a big scratchy dog, we kiss under the phosphorescent glow of the cloud-diffused moon and, well, if you know about kissing a loved one, enough said.T 12:00 Back at home, the cat fed, and Soulmate is falling asleep after an intense day, too tired by this point to respond to amorous innuendos. I follow her to bed after a final nod to Jah Rastafari, and lay curled up next to her luscious naked, warm body, matching my breathing to hers, some CEVs still present, which slowly take the shape of her oncoming dreams. T 12:30 Thinking there is no way I can fall asleep, I find myself in the midst of a lucid dream, floating, no, flying slowly above an endless lazy blue-green crystal ocean glistening in the breezy tropical sun. The answers to all questions come, realizations yet again, ephemeral yet again.One remains, of Beauty of Good Intention combined with the Will to Power as the manifestation of a plan of a higher intelligence, and that quintessence of Beauty, regardless of Perception, is Love. This was my fourth experience with 4-HO-MiPT, though it's my first time making a trip report about it here. I had used it previously at 20, 25, and 30 mg, and at all of these doses I had found it to be a subtle psychedelic, producing a mixed body load with euphoria but also some muscle tension and nausea without any very significant psychological effects aside from empathy and only mild waving visuals around the borders of objects or textures. My favorite thing about it so far had been the way it enhanced my imagination, making it much more colorful and erotic, so I was wondering if this effect would increase to something more overt at 50 mg. Much to my surprise, it seemed that the drug had something very different in store for me.My previous experience with psychedelics includes Psilocybe cubensis, Ipomoea tricolor, Argyreia nervosa, bufotenin, DMT, LSD, 2C-B, 2C-I, DOC, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, 4-AcO-MET, 4-HO-DET, 4-AcO-DET, 4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-DPT, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-AcO-DALT, MiPT, DiPT, DALT, and at least a couple of unidentified things.Unfortunately, unlike my previous trip reports, I did not manage to take any notes with timestamps this time around. To be honest, I was nowhere near expecting the intensity of this trip which was several times greater than at 30 mg, not a linear dose response at all. I was nowhere near expecting the intensity of this trip which was several times greater than at 30 mg, not a linear dose response at all. For that reason I went into it expecting to be able to just take notes casually, but I ended up becoming so immersed in the experience that that just never happened. Consequently, I will have to describe this trip entirely from memory, so please forgive me if anything has escaped me now.It was early in the morning and I had the apartment to myself, and I had the desire to take something psychedelic. I had 4-HO-DET lined up for my next really heavy trip, but I wasn't really looking for that kind of experience this time around. I figured that since 30 mg of 4-HO-MiPT had still been completely lucid for me, 50 mg shouldn't be that hard to handle alone (haha). I weighed it out, dumped it in a gel capsule, and down the hatch it went.Most notable to me at first was that the capsule seemed to drastically slow down the onset from how I'm used to eating it just straight; I'd normally feel that kicking in hard within about fifteen to twenty minutes, but this time at about an hour I was honestly starting to wonder if the chemical had somehow degraded despite the fact that it still looked completely white. However, just as I was having these thoughts, I moved my hand and there they were: tracers, tracers, and tracers of tracers. They went from nothing to almost blinding, creating too many copies to see through the spaces of, stacking upon each other, and just floating in front of me wherever I tried to look. I started to become anxious that I had gotten myself into more than I had prepared for, and I stood up to try to gauge my situation. As I did so the floor pulled down into itself as if I was heavily dissociated, and it became clear to me just how hard this was hitting me as I began to feel the clarity about my situation or past memories starting to slip away as well.So far the intensity of the detachment that it was hitting me with was comparable to the same dose of 4-HO-MPT, but I had been in a better situation to let go at that time then I was now, and my gut told me that I should do something to cut the intensity just a little bit. I ended up taking a few sips of wine as the trip was still reaching its full peak, and it did nothing to hinder the intensity of the sensory overload, but it did help me stay a little more lucid and relaxed than I had been before. About that sensory overload though, things were really starting to go crazy. There was still surprisingly few open eye visuals for me at this point aside from the aforementioned tracers and the now quite heavy waving of all surfaces, but they made for a powerfully disorienting combination, and at the same time my audio perceptions were actually heavily distorted as well and echoed to a point that it was extremely difficult to tell what was or was not happening around me, especially outside where I could hear but not see things. It was also very difficult for me to enjoy any bodily euphoria which was occurring at that point because I was also getting some gastrointestinal distress which was intensified to the point that my I just felt really physically twisted up and uncomfortable. It was a hard peak, but I knew it would pass eventually, so I tried to make the most of it.I closed my eyes for a bit and noticed that there was light tryptamine hyperspatial imagery unfolding, of a similar to style to what I have also experienced on 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MPT, but less vivid or developed. It was interesting to see, but not enough to keep me captivated for more than a moment. While staring around the room with eyes open I was eventually able to make some geometric patterning emerge as well, transparent but detailed, which was again similar to but less complex than those other two tryptamines. Notably, those two both also include vivid imagery of faces and things like vines among their geometry when it is this active, but 4-HO-MiPT was lacking for me in this way. Probably the most interesting visual effect it did have for me was that it produced sort of a 'mind's eye visual' I have also gotten from 4-HO-DET and 4-HO-MPT, one which starts with a 'twisted tunnel' geometric effect that is brightly colored in a way that reminds me of meditation-induced out-of-body experiences, and it has led to those types of visionary effects on the others, but did not reach that intensity this time. However, despite the visual simplicity of it, I believe that this combined with the fact that it took me to that point at all is still just another great example of its subtle power.Aside from the visual effects, there was a very typically psychedelic mindset that had me thinking overly emotionally about many different aspects of life, which would have been fantastic if it were the kind of thing I was looking for. I believe that 4-HO-MiPT, at least the way it works in me, would likely make an excellent ally to anyone who is currently using psychedelics in order to have these kinds of philosophical thoughts and new perspectives, but at the moment I don't really feel that that is what I need out of tripping. Most of the thoughts that I had were just review of things I've thought through before and already started integrating into my life in a more levelheaded fashion. But, I suppose it was a good reminder of some things.Eventually, once the sensory overload finally started to die down, things started to get easier and nicer. My somatic discomfort went away and was replaced by a general numbness and the occasional feeling of energized euphoria. Strangely, despite one very interesting fantasy I had that did not really seem outside the realm of what any tryptamine could do, I had no particularly erotic effects from 4-HO-MiPT this time around. I did however have some good tactile enhancement, and taking a hot bath turned out to be a wonderfully blissful experience. I stayed in there for a good while just thinking about the trip and how it effected me and what choices I am making in my life right now, and I didn't get out until it finally started to get a little cold on me. I had a similar dissociated feeling to when I first stood up hit me once I got out of the water too, reminding me of just how altered I really still was, even though I seemed to mostly be thinking and perceiving rationally again.In the mid afternoon my roommate got home from work, and at this point I started happily discussing the trip with him. I was also in the process of taking out the trash when he arrived, and should note that the outside world was beautiful, but very, very bright. Anyway though, after my roommate got settled in he decided to put on one of his favorite show's musical episodes, and as soon as the TV first came on I noticed something suspicious: the startup sounds did not sound like the correct notes. I waited for the episode to start up, and sure enough, the main actress's voice was shifted downward in pitch, and the instrumentals sounded just slightly wrong. Having just experienced this on my previous trip sixteen days ago, I immediately recognized this as the same sort of audio distortion that is produced by DiPT. No wonder sounds were so hard to understand earlier on on top of all the other psychedelic distortions!We finished watching the show about seven hours after I had initially dosed, and by that time her voice and other sounds had returned to normal. My roommate and I had been smoking cannabis slowly since he arrived and this had pumped up some of the patterning and stimulation from before as well, but we had stopped part of the way into the episode and now I was feeling mostly down, aside from a lingering body high. I considered this to be the effective end to the experience, and stopped trying to find more effects afterward.In the end, I thought this was a fascinating experience, but I have little to no desire to repeat it. I thought this was a fascinating experience, but I have little to no desire to repeat it. As I said, the headspace is simply not what I am looking for the most right now, and the intensity of it is something that I can appreciate just after this one go with it, and I can get stronger visuals of a similar nature with other tryptamines that I prefer more. Actually, I was quite surprised that 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT did not even manage to be as hallucinogenic as the same amount of MiPT for me. But, despite that, I can still appreciate it for being the very powerful psychedelic that it is, and as I mentioned, I do think that it would be a wonderful tool for what it's good for. The whole head trip reminded me very much of both mushrooms and 4-HO-DiPT, very emotional and intellectual in that way.I only have enough 4-HO-MiPT left for one less than 50 mg dose, and I suspect that this may be my last opportunity to try it unless it just happens to find me again. I have to say though that I find the lower dose effects to be much more enjoyable and positive on my mind, so I am excited to save it for when the time is right and give this chemical the proper send off it deserves. This is a psychedelic that is subtle enough to be nearly as social as MDMA for me at lower doses and ego crushing on a level comparable to LSD and 4-HO-MPT for me at higher doses, and that is something I think is quite an accomplishment. Treat it with respect, and it will respect you back. Setting: my apartment.  My partner Kai and I are alone.  Context: I am well versed with opiates—pharmaceutical and street varieties—as well as with AH-7921; my tolerance is near 0.  I’ve had breakfast and lunch, no dinner.  My mind and body are relaxed with no distinguishable anxiety.  Product (99% purity) sourced from a trusted vendor with whom I have done business for many years.+0:00 (22:34) Oral ingestion of .237 grams of AH - 7921 which was prepared using a reliable milligram scale.  I place the material directly onto my tongue then swallow.  +0:05 I ingest Thirty milliliters of 40% alcohol whiskey orally. +0:10 My stomach feels slightly uneasy, but not severe enough to purge.  I sit comfortably in a recliner while listening to music.+0:30 The nausea is dissipating & I note my first alert of departing baseline.  This occurs in the form of light anesthetic sensations in both forearms as well as a pleasant mood lift.  +0:45 I smoke .3 grams of cannabis from a water pipe.  This increases the mood elevation further to a low level of euphoria.  The feeling is returning to my forearms and no other physical effects are present.  +01:00 My thought process is sharp, void of any dullness or haziness that is commonly present on other opiates. My body is slightly numbed and when I pay attention to the contact points where my arms and hands rest on my legs, I find it difficult to determine exactly where the limbs are touching.  I am not experiencing any auditory effects.  My music sounds normal and my pleasure derived from listening is not enhanced from a baseline state.  +02:00 Time is passing at about half tempo.  The past hour seems to have lasted for twice that.   Standing up for the first time since I sat down several minutes post ingestion immediately brought back the unpleasant feelings in my stomach.  I sit back down.  My stomach settles almost immediately.  I continue to test the relationship between movement & the nausea.   Causational relationship affirmed. +02:45 I smoke another .3 grams of cannabis through the water pipe.  I continue to stay seated comfortably and enjoy the peak of effects. With an unclouded mind I close my eyes.  My thought stream is unaffected in topic or speed.  I turn off the mental conversation & attempt informal meditation. I mentally and physically lock into a beautiful & intense focus on my breathing.  I slowly open my eyes to find my heart beating slower than it has all night (normal up until this point).  The opiate high Is fairly significant at this point.  A warm buzzing sensation throughout my body seduces my mental focus and I smile childishly.  I forget the possible consequences of movement and I head to lay down in my bed, a short walk with no stairs required.  +03:30 The nausea hits me harder than it has all night two paces from the edge of my bed.  I spin and head to the adjacent bathroom.  I’m slightly stunned by the harsh lighting.  Vertigo; by classic definition, strikes me.  I gain control of the balance enough to fill and drink a glass of water before propping myself upright in bed.  Closing my eyes brings back the spinning sensation.  With my eyes open I feel on the verge of nausea but this lessens the longer I am laying still in one position.  My mind relaxes and I realize I actually am very comfortable.  My muscles are relaxed and I can feel a warm glowing sensation coming from within.  I concentrate on these pleasant effects and slip easily back into a pleasant mood having not a care in the world.  The unpleasant vertigo was behind me and seemed miles away.+04:00  I choose to remain in bed, finding conversation uncomplicated and enjoyable.  The body high is dwindling at a steady pace now.  Movement continues to produce nauseas in my stomach and spinning sensations in my mind.  After several minutes of staying relatively motionless these effects disappear entirely.  The negative effects are mirroring the intensity of the pleasurable ones.  +04:30  Rapidly approaching baseline I prepare myself for bed.  The process involves a short walk for water and a trip to the bathroom.  The dizziness returns, strong enough for me to pause, debating a purge before sleeping.  Deciding against the idea I return to my elevated supine position in the bed.  After a few seconds of motionlessness my stomach returns to normal.  A peaceful calmness drifts over my mind and body.  I fall asleep with more ease than my average night.I enjoyed the experience & while not perfect, certain redeeming qualities exist.  The 'forced' lack of motion turns the mind inward, tuning the experience toward meditation.  The anesthetic qualities are useful for medicating physical pains.  The nausea is the only negative effect I have experienced, but is certainly a large factor. It's hard for me to drink due to stomach problems and bleeding ulcers somewhere in my intestines, but I love getting drunk. I once came across the idea of alcohol enemas and have been forever curious about it... if it works, and what the experience is like since this method bypasses most of the digestive track. I was in a good mood, and really wanted to get drunk so I finally decided to give it a try and thought I'd share my experience with others who are curious, as there are many rumors/questions surrounding such activity. It should be noted that from what I understand this can be a VERY dangerous and potentially fatal route of alcohol consumption. If one decides to give this a go, every consideration should be taken.Having read that using hard alcohol (vodka, whiskey, tequila) can cause considerable amounts of pain, bleeding, Chron's disease, and death resulting from alcohol poisoning I decided to go with something more gentle for this experience. I used undiluted wine. Specifically, a brand called Carlo Rossi white zinfandel.Not knowing exactly how much to use, but knowing that if this experiment worked I would probably be getting more alcohol in my blood than if I had drank it, I decided to use a rule of thumb that suggested using about half the amount you would normally drink to get drunk. I took an educated guess and measured out exactly 32 oz.For the record I should state that I don't drink often at all (only a few times per year) due to my medical conditions so I have a low tolerance. I'm 5'10' and weigh 140 lbs. so I don't have a lot of body weight behind me either.I waited until I had to take a dump in order to ensure that my colon would be clean to facilitate proper absorption. I stripped down naked, used the bathroom and cleared my bowels.For the actual insertion of alcohol in this experiment I used a 12 ml syringe with the tip removed that came with a printer cartridge refill kit. After measuring out 32 oz of wine I used some sex lube and lubed my asshole up. On the bathroom floor I put the alcohol down in front of me and got down on my hands and knees. I filled the syringe with wine, put my ass in the air with my chest almost touching the floor so that the wine would flow downward into my colon and inserted the syringe as far as it would go. I squeezed the plunger and felt the wine squirt into my intestines. In a few seconds it felt warm, slightly burning. My stomach cramped a little bit and I had mild pains like I had to shit. 2-3 minutes later the burning and cramping stopped. I filled the syringe and did it again. I had to repeat this refilling/inserting process quite a few times to get all the alcohol in me because the syringe I was using was quite small. It took a total of about 30 minutes to get it all in. 32 oz seemed like the right amount because right at the end, almost at the last drop there came a point where I literally couldn't fit anymore inside me and my intestines were too full. I'm glad I had the foresight to put some plastic trash bags down on the floor because there was a bit of leakage from my ass as I became fuller and fuller.To my surprise within 5-10 minutes into the filling process I was starting to feel DRUNK. After I had all the wine inside me (which as I said took about 30 minutes), I stood up and started to feel the drunkenness coming onto me as the room was slightly spinning. I cleaned everything up (which took about another 20 minutes) while holding the alcohol inside. At some points the burning/cramping returned and I found it to be somewhat of a challenge to hold it in. The burning/cramping didn't last long when it did come back, lasting for only a few minutes, but was sometimes intense.At about the 40-50 minute range while I was cleaning up and holding the wine in I started to feel more and more drunk. After approximately another 15 minutes I absolutely couldn't hold it anymore and ran to the toilet, letting it all out. I took a shower and continued to slightly gain in drunkenness. After my shower, I was now pretty drunk but it was a weird kind of drunk. It's kind of hard to describe. It felt mellow and my memory was blacking out in spots, but I still had control of most of my motor skills although I was slightly clumsy. It wasn't a 'falling over' drunk but still pretty satisfying. The best part- I felt NO nausea/sickness whatsoever! There was something REALLY weird, though. Even though I had drank no alcohol, I could still taste it on my breath and if I burped I would taste the wine!The one thing that surprised me about this experiment was that the maximum effects didn't last as long as if I had gotten drunk by drinking. I was at the height of my drunkenness for about 1 1/2 hours, then started to sober up. After about 5 hours total from the time I finished filling myself with wine I felt totally in control and pretty sober, but really spaced out. This was a strange feeling that I had never experienced when getting drunk orally.I also experienced some weird physical sensations while sobering up. Again, it's hard to describe... it felt like I SHOULD be sick but wasn't. It felt like my body wanted to be sick or do SOMETHING but it couldn't. I felt kind of shaky, and my legs were a little wobbly and involuntarily twitchy. I also had cold sweats.Still feeling not really drunk anymore but spaced out, at about 8 hours in I decided to go to bed. I fell asleep, but tossed and turned all night with bad nightmares. I awoke the next morning at about 8:30 STILL in that spacey state and it took another few hours to get back to normal BUT... NO hangover to speak of whatsoever! No headache, no sickness and very little dehydration. I just felt a little slow mentally. I also felt slight intestinal irritation/cramps but those went away very quickly. By 1:00 in the afternoon I was completely back to normal. Also, my intestines felt noticeably 'cleaner'.So, in conclusion regarding my experience:The good:- It DID WORK and allowed me to get drunk while not actually ingesting alcohol orally.- No sickness or hangover! Some may argue that this point is worth its weight in gold.- While it did not allow me to be drunk for an extended period of time, the sobering up and mellow spaced out feeling was really nice.The bad:- It took way too much time setting up, actually giving myself the enema, and the cleanup process. - It was fairly messy. Maybe REAL enema equipment and a better technique for delivery would have made it much better.- The maximum effect of intoxication did not last as long as oral ingestion and that was kind of a disappointment. It's possible that I needed to use more alcohol or a wine with a higher alcohol content. Maybe I should have released the alcohol I was holding and then started filling myself up again. Not being sure, I didn't want to risk alcohol poisoning and then I wasn't going to spend another hour filling my ass with more wine.Besides, at that point I was drunk enough that I don't think I would have been able to do it without making a considerable mess.- That weird 'should be sick' kind of feeling, along with twitching/cold sweats. I tried my best, but it's really something you have to experience to be able to describe.All in all I don't think I will be repeating this experience. My main goal was to put some of the rumors/questions to rest for myself and in that regard I succeeded. It was interesting that it actually worked, but the time and effort it took just weren't worth the effects. I hardly dabble in anything other than the daily smoking of weed and weekend drinking. So when my friend E tells me he knows someone with quite a bit of LSD to sell, I get immediately excited but wary at another go-round of purchasing and tripping. Having wasted two days on bunk acid in the past, I was ready for a clear picture of what acid was even like. I was never impressed by my two previous trips with only mild effects from the blotters and gel tabs I tried. Comparable to my separate glowing experiences on mushrooms, weed, ecstasy and peyote, acid was not memorable. Regardless of my reluctance to try out Lucy again, I decide to purchase 15 hits of it from E's friend. Apparently marketed at 125 micrograms a blotter, this stuff looked far more legitimate than the blue blobs and discolored papers I ingested in the past. A design of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi was repeated on the delicate perforated paper, with an overlay of psychedelic colors. I was indeed impressed and very excited to have a proper meeting in the next few days with the Lady. I originally planned to trip on my own on 2 hits. I was impatient to wait for my usual tripping partner, D, to find a day in her schedule to trip. Being my roommate, best friend, and partner in crime for many years, D is always with me and quite rarely are we apart around friends. This summer in the Midwest was proving to be a psychological challenge for myself with family issues and general college/future of my life stress. I felt that a trip by myself might be a good idea to help solve some issues and think deeper on things I never could ponder in a sober mind of guilt and anxiety. This idea soon was improved on by the surprising request of my friend S to join me on my trip. S was also a weed connoisseur and occasional experimenter with mushrooms although never with acid. He explained to me his claimed sensitivity to psychedelics, such as his intense trips on mushrooms. Because of this, S wished to only get a feel for the acid, requesting half of a blotter hit when the time came. I agreed that a trip with him would be great for the next day, with a forecast of beautiful weather. S is very much a brother to me and I felt almost as comfortable with him as D by this point in our friendship. I liked the idea of tripping with a logical, grounded person that had the ability to take care of me if the trip was to go badly. I have always appreciated the complement of S's methods of thinking through situations and being calm in situations where my eccentric, flighty mind freaks out. I was ready to trip.S arrived at my apartment at around 12:15 on a fine Saturday. Because of the somewhat secrecy needed of taking the acid because my drug-hating other roommate being in the apartment, we went to my room to talk over some of the things first. S had spent the night reading up on LSD and what to expect. I extensively had read online on a few separate occasions to get an idea as well and was ready for this trip to take on characteristics of Lucy, not weak trips. I had only eaten an orange and drank some cold tea that morning, in order to avoid the nausea I commonly get when dealing with any sort of psychedelic. We only dwelled in my room for about 2 minutes before I got out the tweezers to handle the paper. It was decided that S would take half, and I would take 1.5. The rough measurements on what E's dealer told me would equal that S was ingesting 65 micrograms and I was ingesting 190 micrograms. I had no point of reference to know what was standard for me so it seemed like a calm amount. I was really anxious that S wouldn't feel anything from his scrap of paper. We both sat in my freshly cleaned room and put the paper under our tongues. The placebo effect immediately rushed over my body and I felt an air of excitement for the irreversible adventures ahead. S agreed that a body buzz was felt within five minutes, but I assured myself it was only me getting my hopes up. [Erowid Note: Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.]  I started to quickly gather my belongings for the day knowing we should soon depart from the apartment to avoid tripping around my roommate. I packed what I felt were essentials in my small satchel: phone, water, chap stick, gum, $20, iPod, bug spray and drug journal from years ago. S brought along a notebook and small video camera to document our journey on film. At 12:45, we set off for a stretch of forest I have frequented on other drug journeys and smoking sessions. It was a 15 minute walk to the magical forest, taking place along a busy stretch of road flowing out from my college campus. Although it was already humid and hot so early on in the day, I didn't mind it. S and I caught up on trivial things in our lives and began musing what the trip would bring. My mind was slightly pre-occupied with thoughts of D at her job and wishing she was enjoying the day with us.At around 1:00 we made it to the entrance of the forest, behind a student dormitory. I am hardly what you would call an outdoorsy person but I do soberly love nature and appreciate it just as much as those that can go camping and love it. The magical forest was quite buggy on our initial entrance, so we both sprayed ourselves in a thick layer of repellent. I started to giggle at S and the gnats that kept flying into his long eyelashes. The path at the entrance had two choices, so I chose the one that would show S the awesome tree in the river I like to sit on when I smoke. I wasn't sure how long the forest would captivate S's interest in our acid haze to come since S is far more technologically amused and has really improved my life in the same way via exploring the internet and such. I was sure that we would get bored of the forest and venture home within 2 hours. We walked deep into the forest, following the Green Birch River as the trail swerved next to it. We got to the tree and sat for a bit, talking and enjoying nature. I always seem to notice how the roots look like dinosaur bones halfway uncovered by the base of the tree. I got out my journal and started to doodle and jot down my thoughts. On that page I had written 'oh yes, the bark is smooth, dragonflies, if I wanted to I could snap out of it but something is so beautiful in my mind right now'. I doodled some geese and the tree, wondering why S didn't want to sit with me. I was definitely getting hit by the acid, feeling waves of delirious nausea and confusion. I knew how to control the urge to panic and tell S that it was all about to get crazy. It certainly was but for his first time I wanted him to identify when he felt his dose come on. I still had the ability to text and write.Things chilled out for a second in my mind when we switched to talking about smoking green. It was the beginning of the trend of 'normalcy' as I will dub it. Talking about something so commonly referenced and done between S and I was very ordinary and normal, therefore I felt comforted. We decided to walk further and put on more bug spray. It felt like a beautiful little happy adventure for us with nothing to do the whole day or night. We approached a cross-section of trails with a setup of hopscotch using logs. It made me smile that something from a suburban playground could manifest itself in the wild if in demand. We looked across the forest canopy to see a black and brown squirrel chattering and fighting each other. It suddenly appeared to be the textbook case of race and ethnicity and how it translated from animals to humans. I felt the urge to explain to S my theory on how different colors of squirrels indicate different breeds, therefore they know to be scared and defensive of different genetic makeup than their own. However, since humans all contain the same genetic makeup, we should not be intimidated by others' different outer appearance. I thought of my Indian Race & Ethnicity class professor in the woods in her traditional dressings watching the squirrels interact.The colors all around us by this time were beautiful. A forest of greenery and sunshine with hundreds of plants and animals seemed like a mind treat. Feelings of being in a dream and being stoned ruled my sensations. The vivid colors of dragonflies amused me as S began coming up, I think. Between 1:30 and 2:30ish we wandered and S had a great idea involving using the iPhone App that allows you to find hidden treasure called geocaching. S and I looked up for treasure in the area and were giddy to see that one was marked as very close to us in the woods. I began to explain my only time burying something as part of a self-treasure hunt in the future, which turned into an elaborate lie to avoid telling S it was a McDonald's toy in a jewelry box. It just seemed like such a trivial piece of childhood memory that I felt embarrassed to share with him, having never really thought of that memory since I was 8.Well our hunt began for the geo. I was beyond excited to find something while on acid. Making do without GPS, we wandered up a new trail, trying to keep in mind where we came from to avoid acidy panics later. We decided to rest in the middle of a trail on a log, still admiring the vibrant canopy and little forest noises. S brought up a random memory from a party the previous weekend we both were at, involving me seeing an ex-boyfriend. As I started musing on how strange it was to see him, I started to think S was him trying to trick me into talking about himself. I was frazzled that I had weirdly associated that in my mind, and told S what happened. We both decided to keep on moving but standing up from the log opened up the full-on trip. I stared into S's face and saw how the flaps of skin hung on his jaw and cheek bones. The idea that his face was just nerves and flesh constructed so normally onto bones was silly to me. We are all just bones with animation.As I was staring intently at his face, he beckoned for me to come along. That's when the tracers began to appear. I was ecstatic! Tracers were something I always read in trip stories yet never managed to achieve. His hand would move and I could see a smearing in the air of the hand colors. It was amazing and I was glad S could see the beginning of it too. We played around watching each other move and observing the crazy visuals of tracers. The whole scene was a euphoric melting pot of happiness to me and I began realizing the ludicrousness of the situation. We wandered deeper into the forest and I began giggling my asshole off. Nothing could stop the laughter; in fact everything seemed to appreciate the maniacal chuckle I was emitting. The bushes, trees, and stumps we passed were all in agreement I was right for laughing. I noticed S wasn't saying much so I assumed I was freaking him out with how strong my trip was getting. Thinking about how concerned I was in a time of utter mind control made me giggle harder. I didn't recognize my own laugh which in turn creeped me out which then caused me to laugh more over how insecure I was being around S.S started to think out loud about the future of reality. We wondered if someday virtual reality could make us feel like we were us in that moment. We stood and stared at each other, realizing none of our feet atoms were touching Mother Nature's ground, or that when we touched arms they were not really touching since it was all force of collision. By this time we had given up on the geo and embraced the idea of a full day's trip ahead of us.At 3:00 I texted my other dear friend SU to let him know I was an oxen deep in an acid trip. SU has been the knight to my drug crusades, introducing me to the world of mind-expanding drugs. I owe him a lot for the knowledge and safety he always brings to the drug table. The texting was difficult to say the least. S and I started walking different trails from the main 4-point cross road. We almost made it to the beginning, despite landmarks making little sense. Some animal-like symbols were spray painted on wooden markers and I accepted it as some form of woodsmen code. I somewhat knew what trails would take us where so I led S to a torn-down teepee frequented by weed smokers on campus. We sat at the site, looking around and cooling off. Putting the plastic of the water bottle up to my mouth felt strange and S agreed and began giggling over it. My mom called at some point, which I refused to answer. S was awful at directions, given his unfamiliarity with the forest and his new state of mind. I decided I knew the way home pretty surely; therefore we would go further into the forest, following Big River still. As we walked I felt a surge of pure light coming from within. I felt so clean and understood by my surroundings, including S. It was like something more beautiful than my desired soul was leading us, and I was ready to embrace it strongly. The path began to widen and become more finely packed. We discussed how amazingly strong the Lucy was. S seemed to be really enjoying himself, which pleased me. I was terrified of S having an awful trip and being a damper on mine. We seemed to be tuned into each other well, only using minimal words to communicate and being open with each other about everything we thought of the trip. A tree marked a side of the pathway with 'LSD' carved into it, making me feel a little less special for choosing to do acid in the forest far after someone else obviously. S put down his water bottle since it was too much for him to carry and I grinned at the idea of him being a Russian version of Hansel and Gretel. We walked into a clearing with a bridge for a busy road overtop of us. It was so strange to just waltz out of a forest on acid into a tunnel under the bridge covered in shiny graffiti, then into a new strange world. The graffiti itself provided ridiculous visuals, reflecting its shiny coating into the river the flowed next to it.The other side of the tunnel was unfamiliar at first to me. It appeared to be a beautiful park, complete with kids playing basketball and benches to rest on. S and I kept grinning and looking at each other with wide eyes, confused and pleased at where Mother Nature had dropped us. It was a new chapter in our trip where human interaction with people not on acid might become necessary. I was very cautious to not look at anyone other than S. We kept to ourselves on a slanted grassy hill, talking in small fragments and laying down in the shade. The levels of volume we were talking at were so hard to understand. I kept thinking we were drawing attention for talking so quietly but feared to talk any louder just in case I blurted out a trippy moment within earshot of an old person. It was maybe around 3:45 by this time.I was beginning to feel so perplexed by the smallest things. I felt covered in sticky residue, didn't care about the bugs in my hair, and was overwhelmed again by peace and giggles. My mind shifted to a complex topic dealing with memories and dreams. I tried to examine how my own mind was working, whether I was conjuring up old playbacks of memories to invoke my thoughts or if pictures were used or even words. I was unsure if S was comprehending my ramblings and unsure of his state altogether. I realized then how different our relationship felt in those moments, that we were talking totally different than our usual hanging out chats. Our humor was totally different on acid together and I started feeling a really strong connection to S for being there on the grassy hill with me. I had never just laid bare in the grass and stared at someone for so long while talking, it was relaxing and great. We both seemed to be open to freely saying whatever was on our mind as we stared at the trippy clouds. I became extremely sad at how I never seemed to notice this natural kaleidoscope of beauty in nature before. I felt selfish for never looking so intently at nature as I do myself. I then got an overwhelming unpleasant feeling of being caged by clothing. Like every point in our journey, as soon as we became restless of the surroundings we followed Big River farther. We both noted that we couldn't feel our thirst or hunger, even after so long without food or water. Only a few yards from our green mini-hill, we decided to take a break in the sun of a strip of land next to the sidewalk. It felt so out of place to be squatting in the middle of a grassy area where people could walk by. I soon recognized my surroundings as a part of campus I rarely ventured to. I was again shocked that we managed to walk from my apartment to this point on campus and more so that the trail led there. While sitting again, I realized we had been in our new chapter from 4:00-4:45. The kids playing basketball made us laugh at the idea of trying to play in our state. I started to look at my hands closely and imagine all of the things my hands have been through. Bracelets I made when I was 10 were made with the same hands I use now to break up weed. It was a really weird concept that left me wanting to look at S's hands and touch both of ours. I was hyper-aware of how special my body was to my brain, being the only one my brain ever can have. We soon got up from our spot to look into the river and see little mini-lobster crayfish. We both realized just how important it is to do something out of the ordinary with someone else to make it appear intentional and normal, like something as simple as sitting in the grass together. I'm guessing at around 5:00 we decided music might be a fun idea. My iPod was dead upon inspection, killing my vision of leading each other around whiling listening to music, relying only on body language and pointing to communicate. S seemed to appreciate this idea instantly which reinforced my feelings of connection to him and nature. We wandered down a staircase to the underpass of another bridge although S was reluctant to go. Underneath it I screamed as a bird flew out from hiding, causing a major overload of echoing sounds. We came out on the other side of the road, next to a campus building I used to work in. It appeared so different and distant to me, and memories of my old boss began to flood my happy brain. I halted those thoughts to avoid anything bad happening and continued walking the path next to Big River with S. We needed water and I knew the perfect place to find such a thing. We walked toward a big lecture hall I was quite familiar with while passing a tree that looked like it was melting in the heat. The bark looked like the inside of a popcorn bag and I felt really bad for how hot it must be. Inside the lecture hall, we were overwhelmed by the air conditioning, yet automatically saddened by the lack of nature we had been submerged in for so many hours. We had deep realizations of how pathetic it was to have huge buildings stuck in the middle of a serene wilderness of sorts and that it was our reality of how much we disrespected nature and forced our living onto it. While inside, I decided to try to use the bathroom. It was just a weird situation to me but calmed by the normalcy of such a routine. Although the acid was in full force, I could still remember the basic routine of using the bathroom, washing my hands, and drying them. I knew it was normal so feeling in the moment awkward and unsure of my actions revealed to me just how much I was fucked by the acid. Looking in the mirror was also intense in a strange way, staring at my plain and contorted face. The flesh hanging on my cheekbones was startling and I couldn't understand how my eyes looked so different. They were huge saucers on my face, drawing me in for a closer examination, so wide like they didn't want to miss a single thing happening. They looked innocent and evil all at once and I decided to rejoin S before he got bored. Standing around in W Hall, I could sense movements in the hallway that indicated people were present. I decided to tour S around the hall including a very large lecture room that could seat 600. We sat in the chairs in the back, looking out at the large classroom and giggling again at the ridiculousness of the situation and concept. I tried to remember the class I had taken in that room before but could hardly remember word-for-word anything the professor said. I had listened to him for countless hours and never once locked in my memory a distinct thing he always said or anything like that. I began trying to explain to S this thought I was having about the weirdness of my memory and asked him about the phone call he earlier had with his grandma. S speaks Russian with his family including his grandma who had called him when he got to my apartment. I love talking about language and how crazy of a concept it is, especially when it ties into memory. I questioned if S had stored the memory as pictures or if he remembered the exact Russian words for what she talked to him about, or if it was in English. It was a concept I could not figure out, especially for my own experiences of using only English.Deep in conversation, we were startled by people coming in from outside the hall; we quickly got up and left the classroom, chattering nonsense phrases that I felt made us look suspicious. Talking became really frustrating and exhausting for me since I just barely could put into words what I felt from Lucy. I realized that the words I chose to say were reflecting to S what kind of person I was and from then on I told myself I would stop using such dirty language. We ventured up some stairs to a study nook on the second floor. When asked about classes I had taken in W Hall, I could hardly remember the past 2 years of my college education. I then realized how new everything was that day to S, from the forest to the buildings, since he was not a student on this campus. I admired him for being adventurous and trusting me to show him neat places. It was a great feeling to realize S had given me his full trust, and that both of us were okay and content with spending a full day with only each other, like a nomadic family of sorts.After venturing back outside into our homeland, we found a map of campus. It was maybe 5:30 by now and I remembered another beautiful place to show S. We had to cross a bridge to get there with the noisy rapids interrupting my thoughts. I pondered with S what it would be like to be deaf or blind on acid. We tried plugging our ears and closing our eyes. That's when the gorgeous undiscovered world of patterned closed-eye visuals hit me. We walked across and to the place I wanted him to see, being a nice little opening where the river hits a small dam and creates rough rapids. Ducks were just content being around us as we looked into the river. By this time, D was off of work and texted me to come join us. D was with me the first few times we tried 'acid' and generally really loved it. I was reluctant at first to let in an outsider to our twisted logical acidic world but reassured myself that of all people D would be able to put my mind at ease. We waited for her arrival until 6:30. As she approached, I was confused at the beautiful apparition that she was in the sunshine, yet sensed that she was up to no good. I was intent on staring at her until I could figure out what it was that was so off in my best friend. She instantly told me what a creep I was being and that my eyes were scaring her. I became really nervous and giggly and really tense with the whole situation of her being present. Her hair was now blond and her body was really morphed and new to me. I swear I could see the evil in her eyes as she tried to barely understand our predicament. She walked too fast for our leisurely stroll, which explained how it took us 6 hours to walk from our apartment to the dam on campus, which usually might take an hour at the most. I kept trying to look at D and realize who she was to me and how much I loved her, yet something in my mind kept telling me she had bad intentions and was trying to steal S away from me. As soon as I got up the courage to voice these opinions, they seemed silly and I laughed about it. D asked if I could get her some weed for the night, to which it suddenly clicked that she was only with us for her own personal amusement and to use me for weed. I tried to hide how weirded out I was by her and the place in time we were. We sat on the edge of the grass with our feet in the water, trying to tell D about our day thus far. We were still far enough into our trip that it was beyond difficult to make rational sense. Later D told me that she felt like she was tripping balls in that moment with us because of the way we were talking and acting. As S and I sat there, we began only pointing to show each other cool things the water was doing. Dots of water led to magnificent ripples, which led to swirls of water until it smashed into the dam. S and I began to feel hot and sweaty, a good sign that the acid might be losing its power in our bodies.At 7:00, D offered to drive us someplace else since she had her car parked not far away. The car ride was much needed as a change of pace and general resting for S and I. D drove us to a field outside of our town that had cows freely grazing in it. I realized the normalcy of us driving like that, since D always drives places while I ride in the passenger. But the normalcy of it was overshadowed with the intense feeling of D being a complete stranger. I could sense something was weird about either her aura or mine; obviously looking back it was my drug-induced mind feeling that. We parked a little ways up the road and walked to the cows, who happily greeted us thinking we came bearing food. Looking into their eyes, I wondered if the cows could even process emotions like us. The filth caked on the cows was a strange sight to see, since I immediately pondered what it would be like if humans and I defecated freely, didn't wear clothes, and only got excited if we were being fed. No one can really remember what it was like to be a baby and not be embarrassed to poop freely. We decided to leave the cows after much talking and feeding of them.Our troupe headed back to S's place, stopping at a convenience store for drinks and snacks. I wasn’t necessarily hungry or thirsty, I just wanted to feel the sensations in my mouth and see if I could deal with being back in public. The trip inside seemed obvious, like everyone in the store could tell 2/3 of our party was tripping hard. The frozen drink I got was beautiful in its own way, since it was composed of delicate little ice pieces that I could definitely feel individually melting on my dry tongue. I didn't like my interaction with the cash register girl and was shocked that society has not switched over to totally automating everything. I thought of how novel it would be to walk into a convenience store and just ring yourself up and leave. We managed to buy everything we needed and left, getting safely back to our car vessel. The thrill of lying down in the back seat kept me entertained until arriving at S's humble abode. Walking inside S's apartment, my mind started playing tricks again. I smelled the cows, even though we were nowhere near them again. It was very clean and cold in S's apartment and a nice familiar place I had been before. To regain more normalcies, the three of us decided to smoke a little green. Although lighting a bowl and passing it was very much a routine to us, it seemed very difficult to keep it going while we chatted. I didn't think I could feel any effects of the weed on my trip and attempted to clarify with D how stoned she was feeling. By this point I was again comfortable with her and tried to freely talk about the day's events. My biggest fear in divulging any information with her was the chance of sounding stereotypical. By this I mean sounding like just any other report she had read on acid trips, not original. Even though I know most acid trips contain the same characteristics, I felt generally quite elite about my experience and pushed away any attitude she had that her trips were anything like this one. I couldn't help but feel annoyed with her for trying to compare her past bunk trips to mine. I wanted her as well as people in the future to know that what I was experiencing seemed to only be expressed using words I had read before such as 'glowing experience' and 'tracers'. I was growing sick with trying to convey any ounce of originality in my thoughts. At 8:30 I stepped outside onto his porch to try and think some things through and get away from the videos being watched on YouTube by D and S. I started to reflect on what I truly wanted to do with my life. I thought back to how much the past is gone for good now and that we as humans need constant proof that it really happened through documents and videos. My college education is only proved through documents. Then thinking to the future, which only comes in small installments of the present day, meaning I had no real concept of personal growth. I began to get really pissed at myself for not doing anything worthy of saying at my funeral. I pushed those thoughts aside to settle in on the positive thoughts of present goals. I tried to think of what my point of being was at this moment in life and came up with the overwhelmingly happy thought of just finishing school and staying alive. That was a shining moment where I felt clear-headed and ready to rejoin my friends.Back inside the apartment, we came to the solution that D and I would go our separate way and leave S to his computer programming. D and I drove over to our other friends' apartment for more smoking and chilling. The stimuli were a little overwhelming and being around I and J was not very pleasant. I had a hard time telling what my mind would actually like to do, so I decided to stick it out and smoke more with them until D wanted to leave. I was under the impression weed would have little effect on me since the acid was still in control, so I continuously hit a massive bong for a few rounds with the rest of the group. That's when things began spiraling ridiculously out of control. I would begin to speak and end the sentence, but split seconds later have no idea what I had just said. My sentences were more of a world salad with little sense being made from it. D was getting concerned by what I was babbling, like 'I have to stop pushing out because the mist comes out the sides.' I had no recollection of saying some of the things she said I said, only random fits of hysterical maniacal laughter where I would bury my face in I and J's couch. I do recall a ridiculous conversation with D where we used analogies about belts and shirts to explain relationships with various friends. I was so intent on being committed to the conversation that I hardly realized we were about ready to go to a party with J and I. D started picking up random people and dropping them off at the party, while we waited on alcohol to be picked up. I was babbling nonsense again in the passenger seat, trying to not make a fool out of myself in front of anyone in her backseat. A black cat crossed in front of our car at some point in the drive, to which I swore it off and promised D her penny (side up) would cancel that out. We finally rolled up to the party at around midnight. I was so disoriented and confused at how the situation would go, being on acid, really high, and about to consume alcohol. I had been outside most of the day in the woods, was sweaty and not properly dressed for such a party. I felt ugly and really uncomfortable. Soon after getting there I begged D to take me home because things were turning strange again. As I talked to her outside with a group of acquaintances, I glanced across the street and saw her standing by the stop sign with her back to us. I kept looking back and forth between the two Ds and got extremely confused and upset as to why my mind was doing this. To make matters worse, people around me who knew I was on acid kept trying to help me 'trip harder' by getting in my face and making strange noises. I wanted to cry or just pass out. By the time we left at 1:00am I felt extremely embarrassed by my presence in a party like that. Although I was extremely incoherent, I still managed to give D directions home with ease. Upon arriving home, I showered and ate some food. After collapsing in my bed, I could feel the extreme tenseness of my calves and tried to massage the pain away. I grabbed pens and jabbed them into the tight muscles to try and alleviate the pain to no avail. I gave up and hoped sleep would consume me as it so easily does on mushrooms and even ecstasy. The last memory of the night was a crazy closed eye visual of pride rock from The Lion King and oranges in the sky. I woke up the next day sore, wiser, and with a better understanding of too many things. The feeling I could not shake was the lack of desire to do drugs for awhile. I'll start off this report by saying I have experienced alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and LSD all more than once but had never tried any combination except for tobacco & alcohol and tobacco & cannabis. Ever since first trying LSD I've been interested in psychadelics but unfortunately they are hard to come by where I live. When I heard about a friend of a friend getting tabs I immediately jumped on the opportunity and was ready to buy 5 or so, but then I heard that they didn't contain LSD but instead 25I-NBOMe. After reading trip reports and researching them for a while I decided to buy one 1000ug blotter just to try it out, and was ready to take it that weekend before a party.T+0:00. At 4:48PM I placed the tab underneath my tongue while waiting for a bus I was taking to the liqour store to get some alcohol for the party. Initially I didn't experience any taste and like every other time after putting a tab in my mouth I wondered whether it was actually just a blank piece of blotter and I had just been ripped off. After a few minutes however I began to feel a strong bitter taste in my mouth, different to the slightly metallic taste of LSD, and I could feel the area under my tongue that was touching the blotter was beginning to go numb. While waiting 20 minutes for the bus I checked my pupils which didn't seem to have dilated yet, so I expected a long comeup.T+0:30. On the bus I swallowed the saliva I had been holding in my mouth for the past 30 minutes at 5:18PM. My wallet had slipped out of my pocket when I sat down, and I only realised once I had gotten off at the liqour store, but luckily the money I was using to buy alcohol wasn't in it. I was afraid that this would be a bad start to the trip as I was worried and annoyed about losing my bank card, drivers license and all my train & bus tickets. T+1:00. After getting the alcohol I managed to get the same bus driver on the bus back, as it had just turned around and was going back on the same route it had came, and I managed to get my wallet back when I asked the driver if anyone had handed it in. A man who was sitting where I had been before had found it and the relief I felt was incredible, I believe this is when I first began to come up as I felt tingly through my internal organs, and the praise I was giving to the man who found my wallet showed how happy I was; 'Thank you so much, you're a life saver! I can't thank you enough oh my god'.T+1:30. On the train to meet my friends before we went to the party music got steadily better and I could see that my pupils were almost fully dilated when I looked at my reflection in my phone. I was beginning to get the same feeling as when coming up on acid, that something was different but I couldn't quite place it. I began to see slight rainbow swirls when I closed my eyes - much like what I see after cannabis ever since I had LSD. These got more and more noticeable throughout the train trip and by the end I was able to see them with my eyes open in dark areas of my vision. A large difference I noticed between 25I-NBOMe and LSD is that nothing appeared to melt or move around as it does with LSD, and I didn't get the same type of patterns and fractals although I had experienced similar visuals on LSD. It was as if I was only able to access a certain type of visual, instead of being able to view the entire variety LSD offers, but it was still incredibly complex and beautiful. T+2:00. At this point when I met my friends I thought I was peaking, as the longest come up on 25I-NBOMe I had heard about was 1 - 1.5 hours, later I would see how very wrong I was! T+3:00. We arrived at the party and immediately my friend and I finished off the bottle I had bought earlier which was around 11 standards total, so we had about 5 standards each. I hadn't eaten very much earlier that day so I began to feel tipsy within 10 minutes or so, and that's when I realised that I was still coming up in my trip. I began socializing and was having a great time, I didn't care that people knew I was tripping - in a way I wanted them to know because I was having such a great time. I didn't feel awkward at all and had no trouble making interesting conversation with people I had just met, we had got to the party a bit late so there were quite a few people who weren't sober and I felt comfortable in my state of mind. T+4:00. The visuals I was getting had really picked up at this point, there was no difference between them with my eyes open or closed and they had begun to incorporate parts of what I saw - particularly people's eyes and their pupils which started a chain of concentric circles that lead off into infinitely detailed rainbow structures. One of the people I had just met was using a cigarette holder with her costume for the party and after a few drags she said I could finish the rest because she was trying to quit. The power of that cigarrette was incredible, the light headedness and body buzz combined with the alcohol and separate body-tingling sensation from the 25I-NBOMe was more than I thought my senses could handle. The smoke from cigarettes enhanced my visuals and appeared as rainbow particles some of the time - even though I knew it was unhealthy I couldn't help myself from always looking out for when a friend had one. At this point my friend and I rolled up some cannabis in the shell of a cigarette as we didn't have any rolling paper, and went out the back to smoke it. We kept getting caught in conversations and losing each other so it was probably about 20 minutes before we were actually ready with a lighter to have it. I took huge drags and held them in for a long time, the sensation of breathing anything into my lungs was incredible. We went to go sit down and that's when it first began to hit us, he had popped a pill of MDMA a few hours ago around the start of the party and we were both amazed by the strength of the marijuana. T+5:00. I don't know if it was just because I was drunk and tripping and that he was on E but that was the strongest 1/2 joint I have had in my life, it had more of an effect than 3-4 cones in a bong pulled one after another. This was when the 25I-NBOMe also began to peak, I don't know how I'm going to describe what I experienced because it's different to any experience with psychoactives or anything at all in my life - literally out of this world. I was no longer a part of this universe, I was not a person, the table in front of me was like an entire world. My consciousness was a different reality, a reality that was being created and recreated every instant of existence. I tried to carry on a conversation with a friend and surprisingly was able to understand what she was saying. The feeling in my body was unlike any I've ever experienced - it was as if every area where it is possible to feel anything was experiencing the best possible sensation at any time; the palms of my hands, the soles of my feet and every other patch of skin on my body. Time was almost non existant, and the visuals I was getting were so intense that the best way I can describe it is that they could've been an entire reality on their own and yet they were combined with our world which was brighter because of the marijuana. The 25I-NBOMe visuals had completely taken over my vision, although I was still able to see the world as we know it, I cannot explain this sensation any differently as the english language does not have the words associated to those emotions and sensory experiences. Even now when I close my eyes I can catch faint glimpses of that rainbow world I experienced, that other dimension I was allowed to know existed. The marijuana and 25I-NBOMe were working together to distort my depth perception and sense of direction, everywhere I looked was an entirely new world and what was extremely far away before was now extremely close. This peak lasted for at least the next hour, where I watched costumed people dancing to loud music and flashing lights and ate pizza. T+6:00 - T+7:00. Through the next few hours of the party the effects of the marijuana and alcohol began to wear off, but somehow the 25I-NBOMe was still going extremely strong. I was offered to share a cigarette with a girl I had just met and after a few huge drags my trip was kicked back into almost the full extent of what I experienced before, particularly the body feeling. I managed to find the cigarette holder we used before and had a great time smoking through it, cigarette after cigarette. I was offered opium, which I knew very little about and so decided to save it for another party - cigarettes were enough to allow me to experience an alternate reality. Through the next few hours I became more and more in control, and was able to get home without any major problems. I don't know what time I got home or managed to get to sleep but I remember lying in bed at 2:40AM still experiencing open-eye visuals and listening to amazing sounding music from my phone.Outro:I'd definately try this combination again, except I'd prefer to have 100ug - 150ug of LSD to replace the 25I-NBOMe, I don't think anything similar will happen soon as I need to think through what I experienced and make sense of it all before I'm ready to visit that place again. Ever since this happened last night my visual snow has been slightly rainbow, and when I close my eyes the colours and visuals everyone can see naturally are easier to make out, and contain traces of the visuals I got from that other world. This entire event transpired on the Saturday night before Halloween. I was visiting my cousin, James (not his real name) and his girlfriend, Sherry (not her real name) at their house about three hours away from where I live. I was planning to visit them for the weekend and together attend a very festive Halloween house party that had a phenomenal psychedelic-jam band playing there all night. I was excited; I knew it was going to be a great night with some great friends.After suiting up in our costumes and arriving at the party/concert, we all decided to drop some acid before the music started. This was 30-something-th time for me so I was pretty comfortable with the drug and familiar with what to expect. However, having taken this specific batch of acid multiple times before, I decided I was comfortable enough with it to up the dosage to 2 hits – which was something I’ve never done before. I’ve taken a hit then taken another several hours after peaking, but never have stacked two together simultaneously. “I’ve got this shit,” I thought as I dropped the blotter paper in my mouth. “This is business as usual.”While waiting for the L to kick in, I decided to just take a little dip of molly – not too much; 100mg seemed about right. I figured this would ease the tension I always get when waiting for the acid to hit. About an hour later, I was feeling GOLDEN! I had an amazing body high. I was jamming to the music and was completely perplexed by the setup of on-stage lighting effects. I was very familiar with what I was feeling. It was just more intense, but nothing uncomfortable or foreign. With these two hits of L paired with a smidge of molly, great music, a few beers and great friends and family all around me, I was on cloud nine. I was experiencing different dimensions of reality and different ways of experiencing music. I felt like nothing could have brought me down.Shortly afterwards, a friend of mine who was there, Charles (not his real name), lit a blunt and passed it to me. He and I both shared it as we danced to the music. This is where I made a poor decision. I have an uneasy history with marijuana. I’m not an avid smoker, but the occasional times I DO decide to toke up, I will sometimes find myself dizzy, confused, stupid, and completely unaware of my surroundings. I didn’t know it then, but adding a hefty dose of cannabis to what was already in my system was a recipe for complete and utter chaos, ESPECIALLY with my history of becoming paranoid and irritable while under its influence. I should have known better.About 5 minutes later, all I remembered was that I was completely overwhelmed with sensory input and was suddenly very ill-equipped to process reality now that I was high. I had become disoriented, confused, and very uneasy with my surroundings. “I’ve gotta get outta here,” I thought. “I need to get out in the open.” So I left the dance floor and escaped to the exterior of the house. I decided to retreat from the party and head back to the tent I had pitched in the close-by field. James and Sherry’s tent was right next to mine. I thought it would be best to just sit down in the grass, relax and just take it all in. It only got worse. I starting to forget where I was, who I was, how I got to where I was, what time it was, and even who I was with. This complete stupor was most likely a result of the cannabis, because in the past with taking just acid alone, I’ve stayed sharp. I may have been tripping, but at least I was still sharp and in tune with my surroundings. This time was different. I wasn’t just tripping. I was beginning to lose my entire grip on reality. The full moon was surrounded by swirling kaleidoscopic patterns of color. The trees around me were composed of fractal, geometric structures. Everything was FUCKED!At this point, I panicked and managed to pull out my phone and dial James up for help. “James, you’ve gotta get out here! I’m having a bad trip and am starting to lose it!”“Alright, I’ll be right there,” he reassured me.James had always been there for me when I needed him. He was a mentor to me; someone I had looked up to for a long time. He is a very kind and open-minded individual, which is something I had always admired about him. He was also very experienced with LSD and knew how to navigate through its waters with ease. Shortly after I hung up the phone, he came out to check on me. I told him I was starting to lose it – that I was having trouble recalling where I was and who I was. At this point, he thought I was kidding around with him and playing a game.“You KNOW who you are,” he replied. “You cannot be serious. C’mon, act like an adult, here.”I began rattling off facts about myself. I told him my name, where I was born and who my parents were. At that moment, I began thinking about my family -- specifically my mother, my father, and my sister. While trying to remember my family and the memories I had with them, I think James was trying to explain the universe to me (I honestly cannot vividly remember). He was talking to me about atoms and energy and waves and LSD and thoughts and emotions. All the while, I was trying to hold on to the memories of my family that were slipping away from my mind. On one hand, I’m trying not to lose the memories of my family that are near and dear to me. On the other hand, my cousin was severely fucking with my head (which I don’t believe he was doing on purpose) trying to calm me down and explain things to me.Nevertheless, I began FREAKING OUT! I somehow got it in my head that this man in front of me was evil and was attempting to steal my childhood memories of my family from me. In hindsight, what scared me the most was the fact that, at that point, I lost all connection with reality and no longer recognized James as my cousin. All I knew was that I was losing the memories of my family forever and the person talking to me was responsible for this. This was NOT okay with me! All I wanted was to feel my mother and father’s love one last time before I was sure I’d never see or remember them again. My fight or flight instinct kicked in. I remember swinging at him and wrestling around with him for a while. I tried booking it and taking off running, desperately attempting to get away from James so I can catch my memories before they were completely gone. He caught up to me and tackled me. I didn’t know it then, but he did this out of love and concern. He didn’t want me running off into the street or getting lost while completely blitzkrieged out of my gourd. When he tackled me, I thought I was getting attacked and was about to be beat to death. “Oh my god, this is it. I’m about to get killed. I’m going to die!” I thought.I began screaming, “Help! Get off me! I don’t know you!” Almost as soon as those words left my mouth, I heard him trying to calm me down. “Shhhh. It’s okay. It’s okay. You’re just having a bad trip.” Right then a stranger ran up to me. He smiled, told me his name, and that everything was going to be alright. This kid was very calm and very welcoming. Just his presence alone made me feel calm again. I began talking with him and immediately started calmeding down. I explained to him that I was losing the memories of my family – that all I wanted was to feel their love one last time before they were gone forever (which I still believed by the way, I believed James was taking my family away from me). He told me to try and remember my parents; I couldn’t. I had very little memory of who I was and where I came from.This is what is called ego-death: losing your sense of you. I had heard about it before, but had never experienced it for myself until that night. It was the most terrifying thing I had ever experienced. I was gone. I had no memories and no recollection of who I was. Everything and everyone was completely foreign to me. I began panicking even more. “Fuck!! I’m forgetting my family and my friends!!” I thought. “I must be dying!” I realized that if I was dying and losing my memories, then my parents were going to be gone forever. To this day, my parents are deeply religious. Up until I was 18 or so, I practiced Christianity with my parents. Although I was no longer religious or believed in the Christian doctrine, I had become convinced that I was losing my family because they were leaving me behind in this life because I wasn’t following in their religious footsteps. Don’t ask me how. Don’t ask me why, but that idea somehow was very plausible to me at the time...probably from the years and years the childhood, religious indoctrination I had lodged in my subconscious mind.I was convinced that my family and all my memories of them were leaving me, and it was all because I went astray from the religious upbringing I was brought up under. I somehow thought I was going to be without them for the rest of my existence unless I could make them want to come back for me. I climbed the house’s pool fence in order to get as high up to the sky as I could. I reached out to the full moon and began desperately screaming, “NOOO! NOOOOOO!! DON’T LEAVE ME!!! MOM!! DAD!!! I’M SORRY! DON’T LEAVE ME!! JESUS!!!! JESUS!!! JESUS!!!! MOM!! DAD!!! I’M SO SORRY!!! DON’T LEAVE ME!!!”I had never been more terrified in my life. Here I was in the middle of this party screaming out at the top of my lungs for Jesus, not because I suddenly believed in the trinity or wanted to become a Christian, but because I thought it was the only way my family and would accept me and return to me; to me, it was the only feasible way to get my memories of them back.At this point, everyone at this party was either freaking out or just staring at me, either laughing hysterically or too shocked to know what to do. Now feeling like I had lost my family, I felt as if I somehow transitioned into a world devoid of all love, compassion, warmth, and kindness. I just collapsed on the ground too fucked up to even remember I had taken 2 hits of acid and had smoked a blunt. I was convinced I was now dead and stuck in an eternal world without love or joy. At this point Charles came up to me to make sure I was alright. I was so fucked up, I didn’t even recognize him. All I saw were people in their Halloween costumes and believed everyone was out to get me...to kill or rape me. I completely freaked out and swung and Charles, hitting him right in the face. I took off running again.I ran into James and explained to him that I just wanted to feel love again. I just wanted to feel the kind of compassion that my mother and father gave to me all throughout my life. I just wanted to be able to love others and be loved. He took me over to Sherry and had her comfort me. She hugged me and told me everything was going to be alright. I looked at her and recognized her as someone I knew, but not as my cousin’s girlfriend. All I knew was that I was being reassured by someone I vaguely recognized who really did genuinely care for me and love me as family. I felt like she helped pull me out of the dark space I was in. I started feeling relief. I didn’t know what to do other than to try to kiss her out of sheer gratitude. Almost as soon as I attempted this, I immediately was hit with the realization that I just tried to kiss someone that I shouldn’t have been trying to kiss. Looking back, I am sure I would have tried to kiss anyone, male or female, (probably even James or Charles) if he or she was the one who pulled me out of that dark state of mind. Sherry just happened to be the person that did just that and ended up getting caught in the crossfire of my nasty trip.I think at this point, the kind stranger (who later introduced himself as Jared) stepped in and said, “Let’s go for a walk.” The next thing I knew, I was walking down an empty street with him trying to recollect what had just happened. I was trying to gather any memory of who I was and how I arrived at the place I was in. Just walking down this silent, empty street surrounded by green traffic lights was both peaceful and haunting. I was completely convinced that because my memory had completely been erased, I had died and was transitioning into my next stage of existence. I felt as if he and I were the only beings left in the lonely world we were walking together through. He told me he was my guide and that I would find my parents again soon. I kept telling him I was no longer myself but had died and was waiting to be born again into a new body. I was telling him of all the things I wished I could have done and all the things I wish I could have said to my friends and family before I died. I told him how selfish I was to my parents all through my childhood – how I never gave them back the love they so dearly deserved in return from me. I began weeping after suddenly realizing I could have given so much more back to the world before I died if I wasn’t so selfish. I didn’t care that I was being watched. At that point, I had nothing to prove to anyone; emotions just flowed freely through them and I wore them on my sleeve.Jared then hit me with stunning news:“You’re not dead,” he said. “You had just mixed LSD and marijuana to the point where you forgot everything you had even known. You are very alive, but your ego – your sense of self – is completely dead.”Ironically enough, I had then looked up and gazed across the street to see a church with a giant cross lit up on the side of it.“My parents are in there!!” I exclaimed. I didn’t realize or remember this then, but since a very young age, I had always associated the symbol of a cross with my mother. So seeing this giant, lighted cross somehow immediately convinced my subconscious mind that both my extremely religious mother and father, whom I thought I had lost forever, were in this church. Jared and I walked around the church for a bit. I don’t think he knew this, but I was looking for a way in. I told him that my parents were trapped in there and that I needed to get in the church to be reunited with them. He suggested instead that I sit down and evaluate my life – what I didn’t like about myself, what I wanted to change about myself, what I want out of life, and what I should do to mend my broken relationship with my parents.We sat in front of this church for a while just facing the street. I sat thinking to myself with Jared by my side for what felt like hours. After a while, the LSD and marijuana began to subside. My memories began coming back to me. I was so relieved to know I hadn’t died and would be able to see my family again. Almost as soon as I became overjoyed with the awareness that I was alive and actually didn’t lose my memories, I began to remember everything had transpired that night.“Oh fuck…I crashed a party, didn’t I?”“yeah...” Jared said.“Oh my god...oh my god...I attacked James!”“He’s fine,” Jared reassured me. “You should just feel grateful you didn’t end up in jail, or worse, dead in the middle of the street.”I took a while to gather my thoughts and attempt to meaningfully recollect everything that happened that night. I remembered struggling and wrestling with James not knowing he was James. I remembered attempting to kiss Sherry not knowing she was Sherry. I remembered screaming at the moon in terror and agony thinking it would keep the memories of my parents and my sister return to me.“God, I’m pathetic,” I thought. “I made a complete basket case of myself in front of friends, family, and strangers. The only way I’m going to recover from this, is if I take a few lessons from this and learn from them.” That is exactly what I did and am still striving to do now. As I was coming back to Earth and regaining my footing with reality, I began asking myself, “Now what? Where do I go from here?”It didn’t take long to realize the biggest lesson I was taught from that night was that my parents and I have a lot of unfinished business; I am not ready to lose either one of them yet. They both needed to know how much I truly love and care for them. The following morning, on the drive back to my house, I called both of them and told them I was thinking about both of them and that I loved them very much. Just doing that seemed to fill a big hole in my life. I can’t remember the last time I had said that to them.I also learned (relearned actually) that the universe will fuck you sideways if you’re not willing to accept what it’s presenting to you and deal head on with personal issues that LSD forces you to see in yourself.I learned that mixing marijuana with LSD is a bad idea...at least for me. It was a very unsettling feeling for me to be so sideways, I didn’t know who I was and what was real anymore. Never again, do I want to get to the point where I fail to recognize friends and family or become senselessly violent. This scared me because I am not a violent person in the least; I am usually very friendly to others.Lastly, I learned that I am not invincible. This may sound silly, but until that night, I have always walked through life believing that nothing terribly bad could ever happen to me and that traumatic events always happened to “the other guy.” I couldn’t have been more wrong. I don’t care what anybody says. I died that night. I may not have died physically, but I got as close to death as I could ever imagine...to the point where I felt I had once been that way before I was born: without any sense of self or memory. I’m sure it would have been beautiful had I been expecting it and had been in that space under different circumstances. After all was said and done, everyone I had negatively affected that night had forgiven me, even James, Sherry, and Chuck. I feel there were more people who felt sorry for me than there were people who were angry or scared of me. In fact, the following day, I came to find out that many of the party-goers thought it was one of the funniest, most epic meltdowns they had ever seen. Apparently, according to James, some people, at first, thought I was putting on a hilarious act when I was climbing the fence screaming with every fiber of my being. Although, it was very real for me, I am glad there was entertainment value for others that came out of it. For me, it was a valuable lesson the universe taught me. Firstly, some background: I had taken LSD on 4 previous occasions, generally in low doses (my previous highest had been two tabs of blotter acid or roughly 130μg – on other occasions dosage had been half or a quarter of this). I had also taken mushrooms previously, again in small dosages. This was the some total of my experience with psychedelics. My girlfriend had taken 2CB (with MDMA) and otherwise was without hallucinogenic experience, though, like me had also tried amphetamine and cocaine. Both of us are semi-regular users of marijuana and quite frequent drinkers.On this particular occasion, after a lengthy search for LSD (several thwarted attempts to procure it and the hassles of finding tripping time in our mutually busy schedules had interfered), we finally procured some of a friend of my with whom I had previously taken the drug and who I trusted to provide a quality product. He informed me that the sugar cubes each contained two approximately 65μg hits (he knew the chemist) and as each cube cost only about what one might expect to pay for a single tab, I jumped at the opportunity to finally get some for my girlfriend, who we shall call Claire, and myself.  [Erowid Note: Claims of measured microgram dosages for LSD are usually unsupported. Quantitative measurements for LSD are very difficult to do and cannot be done casually. Without further detailed information about how the measurements were derived, it is reasonable to assume that most statements of microgram dosages of LSD on blotter or in microdots are either misinformed or overstated.]  Given that we had met through a discussion of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas at the bar of our university we had long planned this trip and were keen to do it at the university. At the time the regular semester was over, though summer semester was on. This meant the campus was by no means deserted, but was not particularly busy either. Claire printed out one of our favourite poems – Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s Kubla Khan – in the library whilst I mixed the sugar cubes into two water bottles, giving us each about one and a half cubes. Claire was a little nervous, being aware of LSD’s famed intensity and not really knowing what to expect. Nonetheless, whilst still in the library we drunk down our water and then headed to the bar to wait whilst it kicked in (and for outside to cool down a little as it was about 38 degrees Celsius at the time we dropped). In the bar we purchased a jug of beer and started playing pool. Half an hour after we dropped Claire said she felt colours sharpening and the sensation of everything growing lighter. I myself did not yet feel anything I could definitively attribute to the LSD. About 45 minutes in it made its presence felt, but was still not hugely apparent and, but for the fact that I knew I’d only had two beers, I could have almost attributed the effects to drunkenness. It was right on the hour that the first definitive hallucinatory effects manifested, but this still consisted only of subtle warping of the vision at the periphery and a vague sensation of movement, as well as a more acute version of the sensation Claire had reported earlier. It was as we got a second beer that the effects became more pronounced and floaters – like those experienced when pressure is applied to the eye – started appearing in my vision. At this point we elected to relocate to a bench overlooking the lakes and we sat here for a while. Aside from the visual distortion, which was still moderate at most, we felt our thought patterns shifting and making more connections than usual and wandering more widely. Both of us found ourselves appreciating the beauty of the lakes (which we walked by every day of semester, coming up from the bus stop) more than usual and generally more perceptive of the smaller details around us. The effect was almost paradoxical – whilst everything had begun to gain a certain surreal edge it seemed simultaneously at everything had become almost hyper-real, that every detail was significant. We began walking at this point with the intention of heading up to the Great Court, which is surrounded my magnificent sandstone buildings decorated with gargoyles. Once here we did a lap and at one point stood looking up at the gargoyles and laughing, uncaring of the opinions of clearly bewildered passers-by. In general interactions with other, non-trippers, had become somewhat troublesome and a cause for laughter. Generally we were keeping to ourselves and not paying a great deal of attention to those around us. By the time we had completed our lap we were the best part of two hours into the trip and I had begun to feel that the effects were not nearly as intense as I had desired, wondering if maybe the acid had lost its potency whilst I’d been storing it prior to our trip. Claire thought we should give it a little more time before taking more, not wanting to fall into the classic drug-users trap of taking more when the substance does not seem to be working only to find it coming on very strong a little later. We sat and smoked a few cigarettes and once two hours arrived we both agreed to take more. We bought more bottled water (not wanting to expose the acid to the chlorine in tap water) and measured the remaining acid (which was in the form of a crumbled cube) into each with a teaspoon. Drinking this we then resumed walking and headed back in the direction of the bar.It wasn’t long after this that the effects of the first drop really kicked in (much sooner than could be attributed to the second drop). As we were sitting at the bar once more, drinking more beers, very clear and unmistakable patterns – similar to paisley – began appearing whenever I looked at something for more than a few seconds. Pretty soon I didn’t even need to do that and they were everywhere. Things began to ripple and distort in a very pronounced fashion. Looking into Claire’s blue eyes they seemed like lakes, their surfaces rippling. Deciding it was time to make an exit so as not to disturb the other bar patrons we once again left in the direction of the lakes, stumbling slightly as we exited. Walking past the bar I got a strong sensation all of a sudden that the patrons there were talking raucously in Russian, but when I paid close attention they were speaking English, as I logically knew they must be. We crossed the playing fields near the lake and walked into the small, forested gully I had discovered a few weeks earlier, which was completely shrouded from outside view. Walking along the winding path running alongside the gully we felt like we were deep in a forest and the sounds of the bamboo creaking made it seem almost as if the forest was speaking to us. Looking out across the ferns that carpeted the floor of the gully I could suddenly see hundreds of eyes peering at me, though not in a menacing way. Everything in here was profoundly beautiful, friendly at it felt very safe. We made our way along the path which forked twice and emerged onto a grassy lawn on the side of the river where there is a statue of Saint Vladimir, a prince of Kiev who first converted the Russians to Christianity over a millennium ago. The statue is stern-faced, bearded and is holding up the Orthodox cross and the Bible in his outstretched arms, as if for the masses he is converting. As we looked at him he seemed to tremble with a mighty energy and soon was wreathed in a fiery glow. We stood there in awe for a time and then, after maybe fifteen minutes, headed back through the gully, walking for what seemed ages, but was probably only five minutes. We once again stopped at the bamboo grove, which we felt had some sort of spiritual power and seemed almost conscious. Emerging back on the playing fields we walked over the marquee that mysteriously stood on the far side. Seeing a gap in the side we slipped under the flap and were inside. It was set up like a cocktail bar, but was devoid of a single person. On one table rested a single champagne glass, which Claire dubbed ‘our goblet’ and took with her. A strong wind was blowing and the entire marquee seemed to tremble. Soon not just the walls and the roof were shaking, but the ground too, as if it were liquid and we were miraculously walking on it. Looking along the length of the marquee we saw several machines of some description located at the far end and Claire insisted on walking towards them, but I could see them melting away into black slime, which became the fate of the entire far end of the tent and I suggested we leave. We reached the back of the theatre, where the names of every play are spray-painted on the plain brick wall, graffiti-style. In the bottom of the overhanging deck above I could see a crack and as I watched it, the area around it started to darken and the crack spread and began dripping the black slime of before. Judging that the building had a cancer we once again moved on, though through morbid curiosity I continually looked back at the wall and the crack. Soon we were walking back through the main area of campus, which was strewn with fallen jacaranda petals. These seemed to glow brilliant purples and carpeted everything. Pretty soon we’d reached the bar again and went in for another drink and sat on the couches at the far end. The couches were like jelly and the circles on the fabric expanded, contracted, blinked and occasionally burst like bubbles. I soon discovered the bar had been closed whilst we sat there and we exited, electing to take a ferry to Southbank to ride the Ferris wheel there. The boat ride was superb and the buildings and trees on the shoreline danced and everything seemed to have a beautiful, serene aura as the sun set. By now it was about three and a half hours since we had dropped the first time and I judged the second dose was now starting to kick in as the first maintained its plateau. This amplified the experience immensely and the ride up river, with the strong, cool breeze and the setting sun was absolutely perfect.Soon we reached Southbank and felt like we had arrived in some sort of carnival. Though it was a Wednesday night the whole city seemed to be alive and thriving. Looking across the river to the CBD we judged that some buildings were ‘evil’ and others ‘friendly’. We strolled through the rainforest garden walkways and stopped briefly to smoke another cigarette before going on the wheel. Strangely we found staring into the mechanical workings of the wheel itself more interesting than the spectacular view of the city it afforded at its highest point. After a few rotations we became confused and wondered whether we had to disembark ourselves or it would stop. It finally stopped and we walked across the bridge to the CBD, stopping to watch traffic pass by below us on the Riverside Expressway, talking about Hunter S Thompson, Ken Kesey and Timothy Leary. Finally we went to catch a bus back to my house, pausing once again to smoke in King George Square where we looked at City Hall and the giant Christmas Tree. At this point the second dose was peaking, though the peak was far less vivid than that of the first. Whilst we were waiting at the bus station a little while later the black specks in the floor tiles began to grow and spill out and ooze up, finally transforming into thousands upon thousands of tiny bristling spikes which I felt might penetrate the sole of my shoe if I did not get my feet off the ground. Claire experienced the exact same sensation and lifted up her feet too.  Soon our bus arrived – decked out in tinsel for Christmas, which seemed pleasing to us – and we headed back to mine where we watched Fear and Loathing (after a rather poor go at making toasted sandwiches). At last we had sex. Unlike with just about every other drug I’ve taken, the effect of the LSD was not to make the sex more purely physical but less – it became a more romantic thing, slow, gentle and profoundly fulfilling. Throughout the trip I did not feel the effects of the beer we drank at all (though that isn’t particularly unusual as I typically drink a lot and have a fairly high tolerance for alcohol). I did find that smoking cigarettes seemed to briefly invigorate the acid experience, but the effect was very short-lived. Overall it was a profoundly enjoyable experience and even the unsavoury things I saw seemed less horrifying and more morbidly fascinating in a cerebral sense. As yet I have not come remotely close to having a ‘bad trip’ and rate LSD highest amongst all the drugs I have sampled. I do not think it is a thing to be feared, as so  many do. Claire said she enjoyed her first experience immensely and is keen to do it again, possibly at a considerably higher dose next time. To begin with, I would like to clarify some background information and apologize for lack of punctuation in otherwise unnecessary places. This report is based on my first two experiences of something considered a true psychedelic hallucinogen. Prior experiences: veteran DXM user with trips up to 1600mg [pure only, CCC can kill you], PCP, 4-Meo-PCP, heavy cannabis smoker, hydrocodone [Vicodin], oxycodone [Roxicet], codeine, methoxetamine [dissociative RC] , Benadryl, JWH-018 [cannabinoid], cocaine, d-amphetamine, alprazolam [Xanax], lorazepam [Ativan], zolpidem [Ambien]. Possibly a couple more that have slipped my mind. The day started great, I had received 2 days prior my order of 25C-NBOMe, methoxetamine, and DOI. I had tried the 25C for the first time the day of the arrival. Dosage was 1 blotter containing 400 mcg pure lab grade chemical. Effects felt like a dose of any antidepressant, jittery and uncomfortable energy nothing like speed energy or god-like DXM energy, just weird.This lack of a trip had me craving a real trip, I looked forward to the day I would dose with DOI. Kindly awaiting my usual 2 accompanying Astronauts, the day came where I could wait no longer!T+0:00 It was around 7pm the sky was just turning gray. I had come to terms that I would test this DOI on my own to determine dosage. I took 10 mg semi-carefully weighed out on a 1mg accurate scale.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  The drive was commenced. I forgot to play music regretfully, music usually calms my mind and allows me to focus while driving. Roads all looked familiar as if leading to my house, I got lost, and quickly noticing I was NOT fit to drive. I stopped I called my friend G who I knew to be nearby. I drove 2 blocks to the McDonalds and parked my car. My life is unusually filled with extremely fortunate events, this day was no exception. Fortunately G was in that very same McDonalds with his friend F. G and F were on Xanax bars and cocaine, and bowls and bowls of cannabis. G was obviously out of it from the bars and F was still seemingly in the real world. No importance was payed to the fact I just met F, I felt like I'd known him all my life.I tell them I took DOI, F is intrigued and wants to know more. I start to like this guy; he seems very knowledgeable of psychoactive materials as I am; we get along great. He agrees to dose on it. He claims to be extremely heavyweight on visual trips and wants to visualize I eyeball a dose about 3 times higher than what I took of DOI he snorts it. We head to G's house. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  He wants to smoke more weed & I decline but then remember that I have Ambien prescribed. This has proven to eliminate my anxiety while taken prior and allows me to smoke. I finely crush a 10mg pill and insufflate half the powder all at once to avoid a burn. We head out back. F packs a bowl in his pipe and he smokes. I take 2 small hits. The Ambien being hallucinogenic on its own creates something beautiful. The dark of the night around me begins to swirl. F being a slightly chubby individual transforms into a skinny girl. I am amazed, but once he is done smoking we enter the house the light changes him back to himself. I enter my bathroom. I wet my face and I am pulled into staring at my mirror image.Thoughts of the Devil presiding over the water realm flood my mind. The water on my face gives my skin a reptilian like appearance. Where there is water, there is lines of aqua colored reptile skin replacing the water on my face. I cup my hands and submerge them into the now filling sink. I drink, my whole body takes the form of a beautiful humanoid with stripes of reptile like skin. I assume it to be Lucifer. As I finish swallowing the transformation ends. Every time I drink I transform. I have a conversation with Lucifer. Although nothing is said back to me, responses are received. I leave the bathroom and rejoin F. The weed seems negligible and non existent inside me. I take more Ambien regardless, loving the melting and visuals it created. The remaining half is insufflated. My room is now 3D. 3D as in a badly done 3D movie where the depth is exaggerated but even more so exaggerated. I can only describe it as moving scenery backdrop in a play where there is a layer of grass then a layer of moving ducks or what not and then a layer of sky. Viewing F sitting on my bed he appeared to be a puny midget, floating before my bed rather than on it, and my bed seemed to be before my wall. I was thirsty and decided to get water.I served it in a mug. I later attempted to place this mug on my desk but the desk was way too melted. The cup seemed to lean to one side and wobble. F helped me place the cup which remained slanted to me. The desk then began to melt completely and I was absorbed by this visual. F decided he had to leave since he had work the next day. I simply went to sleep. [This was only possible due to the Ambien.]The next day I awoke still slapping the bird, self-coined for tripping balls on a DXM trip. I said tripping balls backwards as a codename which was sllab gnippirt, pronounced slab nibbert, which sounded like slapping the bird to me. The visuals were just simple movements and slight tracers which left sometime around midday.THE SECOND EXPERIENCE 4 mg of DOI4 beers (bottled)Because of the experience with DOI and Ambien I created a hypothesis: GABA had interacted with DOI, taken the the linear visuals and created melting natural-like breathing visuals.The Experiment:I chose to take DOI with beer on the trip with my usual explorers of the spacial mental realm. They have experienced mushrooms, salvia, and LSD. They said it was like LSD to the T minus the long length and immensely vibrating energy (guess that's the amphetamine side of DOI). Although this was more subtle than Ambien, beer still acted upon the GABA receptors. I was given breathing visuals and had for the first time experienced “The Tree is Alive Syndrome” in the pouring rain with 4 umbrellas held like spartans in the movie 300 covering one another. I waited as they smoked bud, then they showed me a tree the tree seemed to be speaking to me! The leaves were moving in such a way that insinuated LIFE pure LIFE! It was no longer a simple tree it was now a friend (: !!! I hugged the tree and then we left. Inside we listened to psytrance. This intensified the trip 10 fold! (Ananda Shake is a wonderful psytrance group.) The rain seemed to be in the room until I said out loud to myself “WHAT THE F! ITS NOT RAINING.” I could even feel the drops. I guess it was the wet clothes. This persisted for a while. I watched my friend play YuGiOh with his Cuban friend and the cards being moved around created such amazing tracers worthy of applause throughout the trip. Everything was funny. When we attempted to sleep music had to be played as they cannot sleep without music playing although his GF also needs to watch something. She picked the most annoying show with bimbos that said “like” in every sentence. I requested a boring show like Discovery Channel's 'Giant Ships' or something like that. This was bad - everything they said was hilarious, every boat shown was hilarious. We had no sleep and just giggled a lot randomly. Till the next day. In conclusion, DOI mixed with a GABA activating drug can create a potent LSD like trip.I have also found that dosing on DOI does not intensify the trip so much as prolong the trip. The trip was just as strong baseline on only DOI on these 4 mg as it was on 10 but less long. It ended in the early morning and began purposely at 7 as well. As a side note the buzzing energy you can let go of if it truly bothers you though I urge you NOT to do this as it will be gone for the duration of the trip and the lack of it will leave you quite dull and self absorbed. Following extensive research on this 'new' chemical, I understood that 6-APB was an MDA analogue, and so, as such suited to an all night party. Before I recount my experience, I think it would be proper to disclose my psychonautical pedigree. Although espousing most illegal drugs for reasons economic and moral, I have sampled, as far as my memory serves me, Alcohol, Caffeine, Tobacco, Ephedrine, DXM, Ketamine, Marujuana, Nutmeg, Temazepam, Codeine, Dihydrocodeine, Tramadol, Scopamaline (don’t ask), Promethazine, Diphenhydramine and nitrous oxide.Wary of receiving either a dud or a deathtrap, I visited a trusted vendor in a local headshop. The vendor assured me in vague terms that Benzo Fury pellets were extremely popular, although interestingly he refused to commit as to whether he believed they were relatively safe to use at recommended doses. The price, although high in comparison to OTC drugs such as DXM, codeine, dihydrocodeine and ephedrine, was nevertheless affordable for a one off purchase of 2 tablets at £8.50 each. The well packaged, official pouch placated my initial fears that I might be shortchanged with loose powder or 'home made' capsules that might not be official, or for that matter, safe. Having never tried this chemical before, my first reaction was to cautiously ingest around 45mg (less than half a 100mg pellet) to ensure that I would not react dramatically to the substance. However, taken in a constrained setting, I noticed few objective effects besides a vague sense of a head buzz and extremely restless legs as I forced myself to conform to the meeting. Walking home I perceived my effort levels to be lower than would be expected at the end of a long day. Cars flashed by on the central A  road, but even based on my own subjective interpretations of what rolling on MDA or MDMA would be like, this initial experiment achieved little more than to discount the chance I was completely intolerant to 6-APB, and to encourage me that a full dosage was worth persevering for the following evening.Feeling completely back to baseline by the next day (although retrospectively sleeping was significantly more difficult even on that threshold dose), I persuaded my most trusted male friend (Rog) to join me in experimenting that evening. These are incredibly precise timings of the experience recorded on my chronometer: T - 4.00: Had an incredibly light lunch prior to ingestion. T -2.00: Drank 2.5 units of alcohol which, as I had expected, gave me a mild loosening effect as a result of my empty stomach.T - 1.00: Arrived at party to find it already in a strange form of 'full swing'. Shortly after our arrival, one foolhardy girl had already got herself into a sufficiently drunk enough stage that she vomited in the host's garden. Increasingly clear that the party was becoming quite a partisan affair, with different cliques effectively self-excluding themselves from the minority of mingling party goers, I urged Rog, who had by this a self-proclaimed drinks count of around six beers to my two (he is a 6ft 6 specimen), to drop our pellets relatively soon.T - 0.00: With considerable trepidation on Rog's part and nervous energy on mine, I dropped the ostensible amount of 100mg of 6-APB with a sip of beer, whilst my more drug naive partner insisted on ingesting no more than half a pill. The real time was 21.10.T + 30.00, the faintest tinglings begin in my head and limbs, accentuated by the cold November air outside. Rog feels nothing.t + 50.00, the effects of the drug now become significantly more noticeable, my sense of sounds becomes somewhat warped, although not in the same way as nitrous oxide or DXM. As we stand awkwardly in a bedroom playing a drinking game I begin to climb hard. I signal this to Rog, and we leave the room full of somewhat hostile egos. T +1.00: I am now climbing hard, with some mild nausea and head rushes. Looking in at a mirror in a well lit room, Mydriasis has become evident. The euphoria is comparable to that of the initial effects of a recreational dosage of dihydrocodeine in solution. More subjectively, Rog declares that he is starting to feel 'brilliant'. T+ 1.30 Standing in the garden, keeping a good friend company as he smokes a rolled cigarette, I notice firstly, that I have absolutely no desire to smoke this evening, but also find that conversation flows very smoothly. It is hard at this point to determine whether I am still coming up, but I suspect that I am since my connection with the world has changed in a clear yet subtle way; no other people comment on my appearance besides Rog who remarks on my marked mydriasis of both eyes. At this point he takes his other half.T+ 1:40 now starting to feel considerably more stimulated, I take a ride into town with some friends in search of some supplies. Although they are closed, I realise that I have very little disappointment, as if the action of travelling at high speed in a car in the dark was reward enough. This is the first point at which I feel as if I am genuinely 'speeding'. T+ 2.00 Some difficulty in sitting still and talking to those who are fully sober. T+2.30 Take a walk with my friend in the dark outside. The physiological aspect of the drug experience is now abundantly clear; exertion is exceptionally low and my conversation extremely animated. Have what feels like an exceptionally profound discussion with him. We eventually return to the house.T+3.00 Around this time the party seems to have reached a point at which many have already left, whilst others melt into the furniture and backrooms of the house.T+3.30 Now past midnight and into the witching hour, Rog and I decide that we do not want to sleep at the house. Thinking ourselves extremely clever and witty, we tell the host, 127 hours style, that we have ordered a taxicab and are heading back to his house to sleep. Little did our dear, less enlightened friends realise we were about to walk home.T+3.35 I decide, exhilarated by our audacity and the magnitude of our undertaking, to bomb the final 50mg. This is in the very spirit of reckless abandon that is at the heart of the night. Walking down the middle of a small, dormitory town we talk loudly on a range of subjects. T+3.40 The placebo effect of the pill unconsciously kicks in, giving me greater energy and euphoria. I sense that both I and my fellow psychonaut are now greatly released from the almost overpowering emotion and complexity of the party in which our empathy was almost uncomfortable. From this point timings are unknown.T+4.00 We reach the exit from the town onto the main A road. There the sign displays a stern challenge – 6 miles to our roosting place. Like true 21st century hedonists we face our opponent by taking pictures of the sign and hit the road.T+? At some point on the 6 mile journey through the English countryside I began peaking to a new level. The euphoria and physical stimulation were predominant in effects so that I experienced moderate bruxism (jaw clenching). T+6 After what we calculate to be 9 miles, thereby outdoing the matheresque album, 8 Mile, Rog and I reach his home. The trip has in the relatively recent time period become somewhat more mellow and psychadelic with high definition and colour distortions giving the appearance of augmented reality. Our heart rates are still significantly above normal.With difficulty we manage the bare minimum of hours of sleep. The next day I experience significant after glow effects, crashing relatively hard the following evening mainly though physical exhaustion. All in all I would rate 6-APB, in it’s pure form, to be a very interesting chemical indeed. In a pretty subjective appraisal of my experience I would rank it out of 7 (the Kamting-Leung Scale) with 7 being high.Duration: 6Physiological effects: 6Cognitive/Social effects: 5Negative or neutral side effects: 4Cost: 4  In brief-At the time of the experience, it was a BAD trip - quite unpleasant. I would not like to repeat the experience, nor anything similar. By the end of the experience, it was well worth having and I'm quite glad that I did. History -It had been about 3 years since I really experimented at all. In the past I have experimented mostly with hallucinogens, marijuana and other herbs. I never blackout, even from too much alchohol, and I never have holes in my memory. I suffered a minor brain injury 9 years ago, I've had severe depression, and anxiety disorders in the past. For more than a year, I have been in decent spirits, relatively stable, and able to work consistently without medication. Experiment - After reading some Jung and then watching 'The Men who Stare at Goats', I was happy, calm, (maybe too tired), and very much in the mood to play around a bit.Between 12am and 2am while watching 'Girl Interrupted' I had 2 glasses of vodka and Juice (about 2 oz of vodka in each). Around 1:45am decided to put about .1g of salvia div. 20x under my tounge like a tab (just wanted to find out if it would do anything). Meanwhile I was brewing some coffee into a cup containing 3 psilo-cubes (no clue what dose) and about 1/8th oz of mushrooms (Cubensis). I drank it at 2am, with less than an ounce of vanilla vodka for flavour. By 2:20 I was a little tipsy and disappointed. Usually 20 minutes after taking 'shrooms I would have noticed more, and the Salvia wasn't doing anything, so I decided to smoke a bowl of the Salvia. I was standing at the back door. The Salvia lit fairly easy compared to previous times and stayed lit so I didn't have to keep the lighter going. I pulled the smoke in hard and fast, held my breath as long as I could and each time I could inhale more I pulled in more smoke. Eventually I exhaled and think I took another hit off the pipe. Amnesia- One moment I was standing at the door, lights were on in the living room and kitchen, the TV was still on in the living room, lighter and pipe in hand. The next memory I have is a vague recollection of getting a drink of water. At that point I already had amnesia of the previous few minutes and was confused about how I ended up getting the drink. The glass was still half full the next day.After that I was in the living room but the TV and lights were off. I couldn't figure out how that happened, in fact I couldn't figure out how anything happened, I had almost total amnesia.I remembered at some point that I had taken mushrooms, salvia, etc. Checked my hands to see where my pipe and lighter were. They turned out to still be by the back door (I don't remember how I got there to find them). Pipe and lighter were both on the floor, and there is now a burn mark in the carpet. I managed to put them in the kitchen but then found myself in the living room naked with Salvia sweats (I always sweat profusely on Salvia, and am usually back to normal once finished sweating/ about 15 minutes total). I could/ can recall a dissociated image of myself, as if looking from behind myself, taking my shirt off but that's about it...Eventually there was music playing from my computer, which I somehow turned off, and I found myself wearing jogging pants.The night continued like that until after the sun was up (Long past the normal 15 - 20 minute salvia trip). The amnesia may have been related to the....Hallucinations- The night was filled with visual and tactile hallucinations. It seemed like there were curtains opening and closing everywhere around me. There were many different textures and thicknesses, mostly greyish - cream coloured. Most of the hallucinated curtains opened with normal curtain opening effort; however, I also remember feeling like I had to struggle with quite a few, as though they were thick, wrapping around and pulling at me.As I drown in an endless sea of curtains, I caught glimpses of the rooms I was in. The rooms around me seemed a great deal smaller, sideways, and off colour/ yellowish. I couldn't identify exits and at times it looked as though I was in my grandparent's basement from my childhood.Perceptions - Most important to me was the way that I was perceiving things. I remember completely losing track of time. I still had an idea that time was passing but was unable to get an idea of what that meant or any measurement of it. I perceived and identified things as being very compartmentalized - People watch and listen to TV and computer for entertainment and information, a chair is for sitting on, the floor for standing and walking on, the house is for being inside and is inside a city, which is inside a province, inside a country, etc. But I couldn't make sense of why any of that was. Everything around me (especially organization and patterns) seemed even more strange and useless to me than normal and the hallucinations seemed more real. I remember that the TV and computer seemed particularly bothersome, almost irritatingly useless. With the amnesia and occasional awareness of changes in location etc, I had a strong sense of 'being' in a different part of my brain. Realizing that I was moving around and making decisions without being consciously aware of those decisions and instead being aware of perceptions/ ideas that would normally not exist or would go unnoticed.Being unable to simply switch back to 'ordinary' perceptions of things at will and not being able to determine how I was behaving physically I also had a strong sense that in such a state there could be two possibilities,A) Not being sure of what was going on in my physical environment - I may be behaving abnormally in accordance with my current perceptions and hallucinations. In which case an onlooker would know that I was unable to function in a 'normal' societal situation and that I may even be unable to physically take care of myself (i.e. in case of an emergency). << or >>B) As to the best of my knowlege nothing seems to have broken and I don't believe that there were any noise complaints from my wife etc. - I may be behaving somewhat 'normally' externally. In which case it could appear that I knew what I was doing despite that I clearly did not. I then wondered if anybody was experiencing and perceiving 'reality' as similarly as it seems or if we would even really know one way or the other (not a foreign thought for me). It occurred to me that if my brain injury had been more severe I could have found myself stuck in a part of my brain such as this, stressful and extremely different from what I had considered 'normal'. It also occurred to me that, in that case, people may or may not have been able to truly identify or understand the situation. I suddenly found myself with a great deal of compassion for those with severe mental illness. It was probably largely influenced by watching 'Girl Interrupted' (which is why I mentioned it earlier). I have a new appreciation for my mind and the functionality of my brain. My own experiences with mental issues now seem quite trivial as I wonder at the way in which some people may be experiencing life.Side effects-While I describe the hallucinations with a certain amount of dispassion it was fairly terrifying being unable to find an exit to the 'endless sea of curtains' draping around me and overall very stressful. Also the sensation was not comfortable. Despite that they were imagined, some of the curtains seemed course and rough, some were heavy, and some felt like cold plastic with slightly sharp edges, etc. I recall having some indigestion (not too severe) which was not too uncommon for me when experimenting with mushrooms and alcohol in my youth.Roughly 8 - 9 hours later (although I'm not really sure what time I actually sobered up and went to sleep, I do know that the sun was up) I took a bath and started tripping out again. I quickly got out of the bath tub and worried that I was about to have a bad flashback or another bad trip. I jumped into bed and instead of having trouble I just enjoyed a floating sensation slightly glowing walls and ceiling. It ended about half an hour to 45 minutes later. So I got a gram of some very pure, very white, very potent JWH-018 off the net for around $30. This is is purest form of JWH-018 I have ever come across as well. The bag looked from eyeballing it to have slightly more than a gram in it, but then again, I had no scale and the little baggie was really full.My first two or three tries to make it work in a light-bulb vaporizer didn't work very well due to leaks around the cap and the high-heat needed to vaporize the chemical kept blacking the bulb up with the candle I was using, so revamping my approach I went to the smoke shop and got some berry-flavored blunt wraps to help with the taste. I tore open the package and unrolled one blunt wrap and gently dried it out with my lighter to make it lay flat and make it easier to work with. I tore off a small square of wrap about the size of my thumb-nail. I folded the piece of wrap in half then laid it flat again to give me a small crease to put the powder into. I scooped out a small lump with the end of nail-file, but it looked like a very small amount so I scooped a tiny bit more on and then folded the powder up into the blunt wrap like a little ball.I then threw this into my gravity bong and hit it with the lighter for all it was worth and the bottle filled with a somewhat thin smoke (thinner than a weed hit). I inhaled all the smoke easily, way easier than a huge weed bowl. I held it for 10 seconds or so and then exhaled, barely blowing any smoke out at all. Couldn't even tasted the JWH-018 at all because of the blunt wrap smoke. While I was waiting to come up I drank 1 16oz Miller High-Life beer to get a buzz going. This turned out to be a terrible mistake. *WARNING* DO NOT MIX JWH-018 (or any of the other ones, as far as I can tell) with alcohol AT ALL! To put this in perspective a normal day is waking up and smoking a blunt and drinking a 22 or 40oz  of high gravity Old English just to get the day started, so being drunk and high is nothing new to me at all. So anyways... to sum up until the interesting part...T0:00 Ingested the smoke mentioned above.T0:01 Popped a beer and drank it.T0:05 Coming up, and fast.T0:10 Oh shit... what did I do to myself? I'm high, but too high, with none of the euphoric joy that comes with being too high on weed. Is this poison?T0:15 Ok now I'm convinced I've just poisoned myself... holy shit I can't believe how fast my heart is beating.T0:20 I decide to take my dog on a walk. Huge mistake.T0:25 I'm on the other side of the block from my house when I notice that I'm not controlling my leg movements anymore and that the way I am walking is completely odd looking, but I can't control it... I'm not in control anymore, instinct is.T0:35 I am stuck on the curb. Everything is so out of balance I can't stand. All the houses feel oddly close together. I can't explain it but it REALLY bothered me to look at the houses around me... they were like getting closer and closer together and shrinking in around me, yet not moving at all... complete psychological paradox, but I'm too high and sick to comprehend or enjoy it.T0:40 I stumble home with my dog in my arms... I have no idea why I'm carrying her but it felt very important to do so. I am no long in control of the reasoning department of my brain. It has compeletly short-circuited.T0:45 I make it into my bedroom and lock the door behind me just in time to get a huge wave of nauseousness hit me. I puke everything in my stomach out on to my carpet. I am too sick to care. I puke 8 more times without moving, I pull every muscle in my body puking and holding onto to whatever I can to keep from collapsing. T1:00 After puking, I sit on my bed to combat the spins I got from puking. The smell makes the spins go even harder and harder. I closed my eyes and that's when the visual and mental hallucinations really started.T1:15 I am flat on my back, with my arm over my eyes to black out all possible light from hitting my eyes, because the light was making me delerious. If I could just stay awake in my black little mind-cave I can hide from the demons working their magic on my brain and my stomach. I start hearing my own voice yell at me that I am fucking stupid for taking some random white drug off the internet. I hear the same stupid insulting mocking tone in my voice over and over and over again for what felt like eternity.T1:30 I am seeing distinct CEV now... fractal-like in nature, but with shape and definition and not quite as psychedelic. It had a distinct neon-werewolf look to it... and it was circling around my head, inside my head but outside my vision, mocking me and telling me I was close to death. I notice that I feel like I am losing all my hair and teeth. Every hair follicle on my head hurt, and the nerves in my teeth felt like their were expanding like balloons against the inside of my teeth.T2:00 I am semi-awake, semi-dreaming at this point, slipping into and out of consciousness. I really wish I had some novacaine to numb my mouth, my teeth hurt sooo bad for some reason. I start to hear my parents saying something distant, then I get closer and closer and I see them standing over my grave stone with me in it, bald and with no teeth in a pinewood box, saying over and over and over again 'Thats what you get you stupid bastard for doing weird drugs... Just look at you... Thats what you get you stupid bastard for doing weird drugs... Just look at you...'. They didn't sound sad or even surprised at my death... just disappointed and almost mocking me for dying in such a stupid way.T3:00 The hallucinations won't stop, they don't subside, they just keep layering. I am seeing the neon-werewolf fractal pattern circling my head, my parents over my grave, and my own voice screaming at me in my head.T20:00 So I just slept for 17 hours... I have a killer headache and everything feels OK I guess. I feel like somethings is wrong with my brain... hopefully it wears off. I am almost certain that what I had in hind-sight was a cannabinoid-induced schizophrenic reaction to the drug mixed with the alcohol. I am not a schizophrenic, I have never been diagnosed with it, but the vividness and nature of the hallucinations, and how real it all felt to me at the time it all matches up with paranoid schizophrenic behavior. Even with the bad experience above, once I learned to not mix it with alcohol and I found the right dosage I was good and I could actually somewhat enjoy the high, but I think I'll stick with weed when I can get it!JWH-018 is a full-agonist of the cannabinoid receptors, whereas the cannabinoids in good old fashioned weed are partial-agonists. This could explain the reason why it is a more paranoid and less euphoric feel than weed itself as well. My Detoxification – June 2007BACKGROUNDThere's a history of alcoholism in male uncles on both sides of my family, some are still “functional,” but the older, chronically addicted uncles died by age 60. I drank alcohol responsibility for about 20 years (15yr to 35yr). I started drinking most nights about 10 years ago, but rarely exceeding 6 drinks per night -- mostly beer. My drinking escalated to 12+ drinks per night, including sake, and vodka, early this year. I have never consumed alcohol during the day, or when my duties required a clear head. Interestingly, according to my observations, and testimony from relatives, this daytime sobriety and “duty before drinking” ethic is pervasive amongst the functional alcoholics in my family.HIGH BLOOD PRESSUREAfter a visit to the ER in 2002, I was diagnosed with high blood pressure. Note that my drinking at that time was frequent, but not excessive. Since then, I've been taking blood pressure meds daily, and significantly reduced my salt intake. My diet has always been excellent, low fat, low cholesterol, low refined sugar, and a good balance with fruits and vegetables. Notably however, until recently, I was a chronic couch potato. After the BP diagnosis, I found out that my hypertension might be inherited on my mother's side, my mother was diagnosed with essential (no clear medical cause) hypertension, and her grandfather had hypertension, and died at an early age after multiple strokes. Both are/were otherwise in good physical condition. Presenting with elevated BP in early June 2007, I was prescribed a diuretic, to add to the other BP medication.On Sunday, June 10, 2007, after more than usual alcohol the night before (20+ drinks), my BP skyrocketed, I measured 226/124. I took additional BP meds (Not blindly:  I'd previously studied safe dosage schedules for both BP meds.). The extra drugs had no effect. Lightheaded, arms tingling, and distinctly feeling each beat of my heart, my wife drove me to “Capital City” Urgent Care. BP measured by Urgent Care was similarly high  Because I reported no heart attack symptoms, I waited an hour before treatment.  Eventually, a doctor administered Clonidine 0.2mg, which brought my BP back down to the 160/100 range.  They released me with two 0.2mg Clonidine tablets for use if systolic BP exceeded 200, because I had an appointment with a doctor the next day.SEEKING ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE TREATMENTAfter much research, utilizing advice from the online professional medical journals, and credible testimony from past-addicted friends and family, my wife and I decided that outpatient treatment was the best solution. I'd done behavioral homework as well, experimenting with alcohol cessation, to assess the severity of the dependence, and determined that I was mildly dependent: “Stage I” (shaking, elevated pulse, increased blood pressure, agitation). I went to the doctor appointment the next day with my wife, having decided to ask for help to treat my alcohol dependence as an outpatient.Dr. 'Howser' (MD since 2003!) listened to our plan, and at first recommended inpatient treatment (“rehab”), which we politely declined. The doctor then responded with warnings about the risk of DTs, seizures, and death. This upset my wife a little, but I was unmoved. After a 15 minute conversation, the doctor agreed to help us. He advised that I wean myself from alcohol before total abstinence, and prescribed Clonidine 0.2mg 2x daily and Librium 25mg 3x daily as needed. DETOXIFICATIONDuring detox, I continued to take my BP meds, additional meds are listed below. I weaned myself off alcohol for 6 days before quitting, drinking in the last two hours before bed, like so:Day 16 drinks (half usual)0.2mg Clonidine 2x dailyAlmost no sleep, and profuse sweatingDay 26 drinks0.2mg Clonidine 2x daily25mg Librium 3x dailyDifficulty sleeping, profuse sweatingDay 34 drinks0.1mg Clonidine* 2x daily~12.5mg Librium* 3x dailyIncomplete sleep, light sweatingDay 44 drinks0.1mg Clonidine 2x daily~12.5mg Librium 3x dailyIncomplete sleep (<6 hours)Day 52 drinks~0.05mg Clonidine 2x daily~8.67mg Librium 3x dailyFull, restful sleepDay 62 drinks~0.05mg Clonidine 2x daily~8.67mg Librium 3x dailyFull, restful sleepDay 70 drinks0.05mg Clonidine 2x daily~8.67mg Librium 3x dailyFull, restful sleep* As treatment continued, I reduced the doses of Clonidine and Librium to the minimum required for relief, eventually 1/4 of the Clonidine, and 1/3 of the Librium – at the prescribed doses, those drugs made me unsafely clumsy and frustratingly stupid. The Clonidine tablets are easy enough to divide with a pill splitter, but it became necessary to break open the Librium caplets and divide them among 2, and finally 3 gel caplets to get a low enough dose. Note that I appreciated the availability of the full prescribed doses, just in case my BP became difficult to control.CLOSING REMARKSIt disappointed me that outpatient treatment was discouraged, at least by the 'king' of all HMOs, seemingly as a matter of policy.  Highly motivated, mildly addicted persons like myself can be treated, with family support, for very low cost in terms of physician face time and drugs prescribed.  Because Doogie effectively functioned only as a drug gatekeeper, I was forced to research mild alcohol self-treatment myself.  The best relevant document I found is this:  http://www.aafp.org/afp/990915ap/1175.html#table%202Please seek professional medical advice before starting any self-treatment program, even if your alcohol withdrawal symptoms are as mild as mine (shaking, elevated pulse, increased blood pressure, agitation).  Also, be aware that it is not usually recommended to combine alcohol with some of the drugs I used in my self-treatment.  Again, consult your doctor before proceeding.Thanks for reading.  I hope this helps others seek treatment before it gets out of hand.Cheers! After reading about Green Dragon, where marijuana is placed in alcohol to dissolve the THC and other interesting substance, I was curious to try it. When searching, I found that the amount of marijuana and the amount of alcohol varied all over the place, and it was hard to find anything approaching an experience report that also mentioned the strength and method of the preparation and went beyond 'I drank this and I got fuckin' lit,' so I decided to write up my experience.I purchased a liter of Devil's Springs 80% ethanol 'vodka,' the strongest alcohol labelled for human consumption available near me. I imagine you'd get practically identical results with Everclear at 95%, Bacardi 151 at 75.5% or anything around that range, although you'd probably have a hard time finding something to mix with to make 151-based Green Dragon taste decent.I ground up 1/4 oz. (7 g.) of decent pot (I'd say somewhat above average quality for NYC, not that I'm a pot judge or anything.) and put it all into the bottle. I made no attempt to 'bake' the pot in an oven for increased potency. I might try that if I do this again. The alcohol pretty quickly began turning green and within a few hours was a nice dark green that was more or less the final color - it was actually quite close to a dark green beer bottle. I let the bottle sit in a dark cabinet for about 3 weeks. More or less once a day I would take it out and invert it to mix everything up.I used a coffee filter and a funnel to decant, filtering out the plant material. Some of the Internet material I found recommended squeezing out the plant matter in the filter at the end, as this was the most potent liquid. I did this, but I had to use about an ounce of water to wash the last bits of the plant into the filter. I think at the potency I was preparing this, neither the 'potent' squeezing or the slight dilution made much difference at all. Be careful not to break the filter if you squeeze it out at the end.For my first time trying this, I took decent notes on the experience. For this section of notes I hadn't actually filtered the stuff yet, just poured some off the top, avoiding gross plant material (because the store nearby didn't have any funnels). I don't think this made any difference except possibly it tasted a little worse:T=0 - Mixed 2 tbsp. liquor with about 8 oz. Sprite and start drinking. It tastes like 'herbal' flavored Sprite and looks like Mountain Dew. I drink the drink in about 10 minutes and am feeling a bit high by the time I finish it. The start of the high feels maybe a little 'trippy' but nothing I haven't occasionally gotten from smoking.T+25 - A bit high, decide to mix a second one, this time with 4 tbsp of the liquor, same amount of Sprite, and adding some honey to the mix. The honey clouds it, making it look like green milk. At this strength it basically tastes like pot, not Sprite. There's a bad aftertaste - not in the short term, five-seconds-long we usually use the word 'aftertaste' for, but in the sense that after drinking this my mouth tasted like pot (not pot smoke, pot.) About halfway through drinking this one I diluted it because of the taste and for the rest of the liter stuck to 2 tbsp. or less liquor per drink and just had two if I wanted to.T+30 - Start drinking the 2nd one in earnest.T+45 - Still not done with the 2nd one. I wish I had a mint for this aftertaste.T+50 - Noting a little tension in my neck, not painful or too annoying. I have friends who say they've gotten this from smoking, though I haven't.T+55 - Drink's 1/2 to 2/3 gone. I feel a minor headache, which I would have had no reason to expect tonight.T+1:06 - The quality of my notes at this point indicates that I'm pretty baked. Tension in the neck pretty much gone.T+1:08 - It seems like I'm titrating the drink the way I titrate my smoking - having a little sip now and then. I've read about others' Green Dragon experience being closer to eating brownies than to smoking - taking longer to kick in, getting ridiculously blazed. It could be because mine is on the weak end of marijuana potency from what I've read - I've read about people dumping 1/4-1/2 oz. into a fifth, where I put 1/4 oz. into a liter.T+1:13 - Enjoying Pink Floyd as is customary when stoned.T+1:19 - I always thought redeye was some peculiar way that marijuana smoke externally irritated the eyes. Guess not, as I smoked nothing tonight and my eyes are like stoplights.T+1:40 - Finished the second drink.T+1:51 - Just got back from laying down for a few minutes, had some minor visuals going on. Closed eye at first, and once I looked for it, a bit of a shimmery sense to the walls with open eyes. Probably nothing I would have noticed before the first time I tripped and learned what to look for in visuals. This stuff keeps kicking in - that is, I'm used to smoking where the effects generally get weaker over time, this stuff seems to stay at the same level or get a bit stronger over time for quite a while.T+2:00 - Cracked a glow stick I had by chance and watched it leave trails for a while. Mostly seemed like the 'afterimages' or persistence of vision effect were taking awhile to clear from my vision.T+2:07 - Drymouth. Feeling a bit tired. Decided to go on a walk outside. I greatly enjoyed my walk and was very high the whole time.T+3:07 - Got back from my great walk, ate some munchies, going to bed soon.The second day I took a few notes, but they're basically uninteresting things about dosages & times.To summarize my overall experience as I went through a liter of this stuff, I found that 2 tbsp. (or less, if I didn't want to get too high) was a good amount to make into a drink, mixed with about 8 oz. Sprite and a dollop of honey. I could have a few of these in a night. I never made it substantially stronger than that after the first night. I have to stir well to mix up the honey, and once I've gotten it right it actually tastes alright - the Sprite hides the alcohol and provides a basic flavor while the honey and marijuana seem to mix to provide a decent flavor on top of that, compared to just marijuana & sprite which is drinkable, but not tasty. I tasted some of the unmixed liquor if it spilled on my fingers - basically nasty strong alcohol and weed. I could take it straight if I wanted to (it certainly tasted less nasty than shrooms do to me) but if I can afford pot and liquor there's no reason I can't afford Sprite to mix it in. I also tried mixing it with Iced Tea, which did a decent job making the marijuana flavor alright but not so much the alcohol flavor. I also found that my first night's dosage of 6 tbsp. was a decent amount for a night's overall use - I don't think I ever got substantially far above that.It definitely kicked in over a longer period than smoking. From drinking this I'd be high within ten minutes, but an hour later I'd be the same high or a bit higher, whereas with smoking it kicks in quick and then weakens over time. One of my friends described it as coming in waves. He'd be high, start to sober slightly, then feel real high again.I never really noticed the trippy effects after the first night. As I said, I do catch a bit of a trippy feeling due to weed from time to time, and it was really nothing more than that. I did occasionally notice the slight headache, which is probably caused by low-quality high-strength alcohol. It was never a big deal.It proved to mix well with smoking pot. Have a drink to get high, and then smoke joints afterwards. My friends thought it tasted acceptable to delicious and enjoyed the effects. Overall, I'd do this again, although I didn't find too many real advantages over smoking. It gave my lungs a break, but at this strength I was consuming enough alcohol to transfer the damage to liver. I haven't talked about the alcohol effects yet - by any objective measure I was consuming a decent amount, and the effects were there, but the weed effects were primary.My reading indicates this can be made at much higher potency - you'd certainly consume less alcohol, which is good, although you might lose the ability to titrate your dosage that I found at this strength. Keep in mind that at the time I drank this I'd been smoking a decent amount of weed for a while and probably had a bit of a tolerance (and I'm a big guy) - where I tried my first drink with 2 tbsp, there'd be no problem with starting off with 1 tbsp or 1/2 tbsp. Personally the worst that happens from too much weed for me is that I fall asleep, so I wasn't worried for myself. I know some people have a bad time if they smoke too much or unexpectedly catch a high dose on brownies etc. Myself, I drank 1 tbsp drinks often enough when that's how much of a high I felt like.I think this would prove an excellent way to sneak weed into places that you could reasonably sneak alcohol into - it maybe smells of weed if you hold it to your nose, but otherwise it's just a mixed drink. Sometime maybe I'll make it a higher strength to see if I can make this a health alternative to smoking without just transferring the damage to alcohol. I had gone out of town to attend a party at my friend's university. Recently I've been using generic tramadol for pain relief, anti-anxiety, and opiate-like euphoria on a semi-regular basis. I have consumed no more than 200mg in a day prior to this experience, and I have never combined it with alcohol. I'm aware that combining true opiates with alcohol can be a deadly combination, but I was under the impression that the reason for that was severe respiratory depression, causing the user to stop breathing and simply die.As far as I know, tramadol does not carry that particular side effect in the same degree that normal opiates do, so I was curious if I could get away with using tramadol early in the day to relieve my social anxiety and allow me to break out of my shell a bit in terms or talking to people, and then still drink at night, as long as I stayed within reason.To test the effects, I began by taking 150mg of tramadol at about 7:45 AM. After some time, I decided that the high was not good enough, and took another 50mg pill. This was a nice buzz. I was up before everyone else and I spent my time thinking about some ideas for work, I even wrote a poem with little magnetic words that my friend had stuck to his fridge. It was not a masterpiece, but decent, considering the limited vocabulary. It was about sinning, or opiates, and satan... or something. Using the only non-dirty words I could find on the fridge, I titled it 'Come Clean''Perhaps God is never brilliantEmbrace in me and my dark universeWe can drink to your Eternity'It made a lot of sense to me at the time, it doesn't seem so special now, but regardless, I was feeling good.I spent the morning high, not even close to nodding, but just... a little euphoric and talkative. I was enjoying myself and meeting some new people. At around noon, I drank a bottle of beer, just to see if I would notice any extreme reaction between the two drugs. Nothing. Little buzz, felt normal.I stayed in the house and drank a few more beers as the hours went by. I was really enjoying the ability to talk to people without the extreme social anxiety that I normally feel. I felt like I was on my game. Like people were enjoying my company. It was fantastic.As hours passed, still no bad reactions. Little buzz whenever I drank, and standard effects from the tramadol, but as day turned to night I felt the effects begin to dissipate. Now, from personal experience I know that tramadol causes effects within the brain that can last over 24 hours. I will still feel pretty damn good 12 hours after ingestion, and 26-28 hours later, I typically still feel good enough not to want another pill without sufficient reason. This implies to me that its serotogenic effects are long lasting and serious.Even knowing this, I decided to re-dose. My prescription says not to exceed 8 pills in a day, and being slightly high, I decided to go against my better wisdom and dose another 100mg to try and get that feeling back -- even knowing that I planned to drink more later. I really wanted to talk to this one girl, and I could feel the moment falling through my fingers -- I had to take a little more to make the night memorable. I dosed up, and before I knew it, I was feeling pretty high again. Except, my head sort of felt weird, and I was worried that I might induce a seizure. I waited for the feeling to pass, then took another 50mg, waited for that same feeling again, and let it pass, then took another 50mg.All the while I had begun drinking much more rapidly. I don't know exactly how many beers I had, but I felt buzzed, hardly drunk.Finally, several drinks later, I started feeling drunk. I had practically forgotten about the tramadol and was *loving* the night. I couldn't believe that I was talking with this girl. I'm way too socially awkward for her to want to spend this much time talking with me... but there we were. I was so happy.Then things get hazy. I stayed out on the balcony, and she went inside. Things start to get dark, and suddenly, I'm throwing up. I vomit a bit on the balcony between my shoes and then realize how retarded that is, and toss my stomach contents over the edge for a good 20 minutes at least. I eventually got moved inside by my friends to finish my tossing in the bathroom. I felt like a tool. I couldn't have had more than 6-8 drinks, spread out over 2 hours, and here I was, violently vomiting. I figured it was a little bit of the tramadol and alcohol and just... a bad combination.Things got much worse.I finally managed to lay down. At this point I realize that I'm going to have a headache that will be fully debilitating in the morning. What I don't realize is that I will wake up early at an unknown time, but several hours ahead of everyone else again, and stumble my way to the bathroom to vomit grass-colored yellow-green bile into the bowl. Something was wrong here.I continued to vomit, and between vomiting, had extremely vivid closed eye hallucinations. Typically the hallucinations would put me in another place, doing something or talking to someone, only to be snapped back into the shitty reality of this bathroom and my condition. They reminded me of the delirium caused by insomnia and large doses of diphenhydramine. I couldn't hold my body up properly, and my legs went fully numb, followed shortly after by my arms. Each time I would vomit it would be difficult. Like I was extracting every last bit of liquid out of my body. Yellow bile was all that was left in me, and I would be fine until my stomach filled with enough of it, I would inevitably vomit it out. Typically about 2-3 tablespoons worth of liquid, and nothing else.I could not move. At times I would attempt to urinate or defecate, and though sometimes successful, I often could not pull my pants back up afterward. The energy required to do so was simply too great. Before people in the house started waking up, I managed to pull my pants onto my hips, but could not button them or put my belt on.I had a high fever, though the exact number is unknown because I had no access to a thermometer. I was sweating, and my body just felt like shit. I sat there for hours, drifting in and out of hallucinations and occasionally vomiting bile. Eventually my friends came to ask if I was alright, and I told them no, but that there wasn't much they could do for me. I asked for water, but I knew that I couldn't drink it. I put a few drops in my mouth just to try and wash some of the acidity out, but just doing that made me feel like I needed to vomit again.Eventually, as things began to calm down, I waved a friend into the bathroom. I was now propped up against the wall, facing toward the bedroom they were in, and looking fairly... dead.I asked him if our friends could vacate the bedroom so that I could try to rest. The hallucinations were still strong and I was drifting in and out of sleep and dreams. I wanted a bed. I hoped this could be slept off.My friends complied and I enjoyed the bed. I got vicious cold sweats. My whole body was soaked. But the exhaustion was extreme, so I eventually drifted off after vomiting just one more time into a bucket.The interesting thing here is that the tramadol euphoria was still somewhat strong, and I found myself singing 'Don't Stop Me Now' by Queen into the bucket as I was dry heaving. In this deathly feeling state, I was there singing 'I'm having such a good time, I'm having a ball! If you wanna have a good time, just give me a call!'After a little rest, I woke back up, feeling much much better, but entirely too fucking hot. I couldn't believe how hot it was. I was shivering just a little while ago, and now I felt like I needed to strip naked. The good news was that the stomach churning nausea had faded, and I was able to start slowly sipping water to rehydrate myself. To relieve the headache I had acquired, I downed three Advil Cold and Sinus. I normally take these for sinus headaches, and I know the pseudoephedrine can get my heart going fast sometimes, but I was about to realize I just made another mistake.As the headache faded, I went out to the living room. Suddenly my fingers grew numb. Then my hands. Then my arms. Within 30 minutes both of my arms were completely numb and tingly, and I could hardly use them to lift things. My heart was racing, but I was fully coherent by this point and began to ask my friends 'You guys know what to do if I have a heart attack right? You know CPR?' they didn't really know it, but they had a general idea. Due to the tramadol euphoria, I was alright with a general idea. I'm sure they wouldn't let me croak. Right? It was strange to be thinking about my potential death while completely coherent and euphoric. I didn't really care too much. Or as I later said to a friend 'I had a rather cheery disposition regarding my expiration.'The numbness eventually faded after giving everyone a good scare, and I decided that it had something to do with the extreme lack of food in my system and just everything else that I had been ingesting that the pseudoephedrine gave me a pretty scary side effect.Now, about 12 hours after the whole ordeal has passed, I'm able to have some retrospective on it.At first, I believed that I had triggered an extreme serotonin toxicity in my brain, but now that I've done some googling, I've found that I just got a wicked combination of things. There was probably some serotonin toxicity, though I suffered no renal or liver failure, and that was my greatest fear. I constantly checked my eyes for signs of yellowness. I believe that I was severely dehydrated and exhausted, which may have caused the hallucinations. The sweating and fever may have been induced by a serotonin toxicity, and the numbness in my arms the next morning was most certainly caused by the pseudoephedrine being taken under such extraordinary circumstances.If I could re-do that night, I would have hydrated better throughout the day and night. I probably still would have redosed, because my reasoning behind that was not entirely logical, so it would be hard not to do it again in the same circumstance. I also would have drank less. Perhaps 1 drink per hour, ideally matched with a drink of water between each alcoholic beverage. And I should have taken regular Advil, without the pseudoephedrine. In the end, I feel like I should have been smarter than this -- and my youthful sense of immortality has caused me to do something that I feel very stupid about in retrospect. I'm embarrassed to even talk about it. I'm supposed to be more responsible than this, and to know what I am doing.I do not know if I was genuinely at risk of death or long term injury, though I did notice some extremely shallow breathing before I went to sleep, and that obviously could have been very dangerous. I was certainly miserable and showing signs of some kind of overdose. I'm sure it scared my friends, especially because they did not know what I had taken. My advice would be to not follow my example. Tramadol should not be used in combination with other drugs, and it can potentially be dangerous to do so.As for me? I have to rectify how absolutely stupid the whole thing was, and pray that the girl did not think lesser of me from growing violently ill off of 6 beers :-P Hello I'm not talking about any one experience for of all in general. They asked for people taking Prozac daily that use psychoactives. I have been taking Prozac for about 2 years now only 10mg a day though. I was going to list each of the main substances I use/ed and how it effected me while on Prozac.Alcohol: Alcohol and Meth were my first major favorite drugs that I started using at age 12. I finally turned into straight drinker, drinking everyday. I couldn't stop, from the time I woke up till the time I blacked out drunk I wanted to get drunk. I started on Prozac and within a month all of sudden, it was actually creepy, I had no desire for alcohol and almost quit cold turkey when I never thought possible. I've went two years now and have been a bit buzzed a couple times. Prozac lowered my tolerence so bad I have 2-3 beers and I'm passed out. I feel like I've never drank in my life and have no worries because I hate alcohol now.Cocaine:I never got too bad into this stuff, I was well into Meth before Coke. Doing lines almost has no effect, Smoking it gave me the biggest rush and best high but wore off within 20 minutes and I was back to normal like nothing happened.Methamphetamine:This has to be my all time fav, most addictive one. I'm not sure what effect is the Prozac and just basic Meth side effects. But it started when I was 12, I had minor anxiety problems and found Meth actually cured it until I was coming down then it would hit a lot harder. Eventually I developed panic attacks. It got so bad I thought I was dying everyday and I quit Meth. I started on Prozac about 2 years ago and the panic attacks stopped and have little anxiety. So then I start using Meth again. Now I'm up to using Meth and Marijuana along with prozac everyday now. For some reason I always get way more higher then everyone else, but my tolerence goes up so fast that its starting to have bad effects. I can't even function now without it, I can't get out of bed for days without Meth. When I'm on it, I don't get high high anymore it's more of like a 'Welcome Back Bob, Hope You Stay Higher This Time.' I litterally am in bed without it and when I get up I'm exhausted and yawning. This continues until my next hit, see I'm a smoker too. That's the only way 'll do it. I don't know how safe it is for prozac and meth but hell I'll take my Prozac right after hitting my crack pipe.Marijuana:I never was too much into pot until I went back to school and Marijuana helped me graudate. I started my Senior year taking six classes at school and then coming home to take six classes online. Marijuana helped me through most of this. I smoke probably 1/2 to a gram before I hop in the shower, after I smoked like a dime of dope. That's how I try to start the day everyday. But Marijuana I've used at least 3 times a day EVERYDAY not missing one day for 2 years at least.Hallucinogenics (Psilocybin Mushrooms):I know this has to be from the Prozac because I researched and remember reading something about it. I've never had any visuals and never had any audio hallucinations. I can eat more then anyone else and its almost like getting stoned to me. The first time I felt them the most then my tolerence went up the most. Although with the Azurescens on Prozac or not had the most effects. I would feel giddy and almost in a drunk like state. But I was able to function normally. Matter fact I used to eat em before school during season. It never had to much of a major effect though like what most other people say. And I remember I did shrooms one time before Prozac and the whole time I had major energy, and I laughed for like the whole night and into the next day. Since prozac I've never come close to doing that. I haven't done shrooms in a while, ever since I got bad into Meth I've quit just about everything but still Marijuana 3 times a day but only a few hits each time, and my prozac and meth. That's about it anymore.Now as far as the prozac itself when I first started taking it my anxiety went totally away and I got all this natural energy and I felt really good about my self. I used to have a problem getting to sleep and waking up but I could go to bed fine and get up after sleeping half as long feeling better. Since then the drugs have reduced the effects of the Prozac (I truely believe) to where its almost the same as I was before it except not as extreme. My anxiety is back and panic attacks here and there. Except my sleeping problem is bad, my friend who does same amount as me has no where near this problem. Without it I have to sleep 14-20 hours. 20 only after being up for a while (go figure) I've done a lot of like prescription drugs like Xanax and Oxycontin and stuff but the main ones were listed above. I felt that Prozac would have been a miracle if I didn't get back into drugs, but it still even after all this, has little effects that are noticable. I have been using cannabis pretty regularly now for some years now, and have always been interested in experimenting with new preparation methods. I've smoked it, I've vaporized it, I've eaten it, I've made hash and honey oil, all with success. So recently I tried something new to me: making green dragon, a cannabis tincture made with grain alcohol.I was in possession of 1/4 oz of medium quality bud--fine for smoking, but dry and a little crumbly, not as good as the dark dank nugs I'm used to smoking. I ground the bud in an herb grinder, the kind you can get from a head shop for rolling joints or vaporizing, and put it in a bottle of Everclear 151 proof grain alcohol (the highest proof Everclear sold in my fair state). I found that, despite the directions I had to the contrary, I didn't need to drain any of the alcohol off to make the bud fit. The bud soaked up the liquid quickly and the liquid level didn't even reach the very top of the bottle.I let the mixture solvate in a dark place for about three weeks, checking on it and shaking it occasionally. The liquid turned pale green mere hours after the mixing and reached its peak color less than a week into the process, but I let it continue to sit for a few weeks more: better stoned than sorry. Afterwards, I strained the liquid through the kief screen in the bottom of my grinder to remove the plant material. I recommend using a very fine screen like this to do your straining. I tried a standard kitchen strainer first, but was left with too much crud, and didn't want to use a coffee filter for fear of leaving too much of the good stuff soaked into the filter. I know it wouldn't be much, but this wasn't a cheap project and wanted to get every last drop out of it.The result was a pale to medium green liquid with a minimum of solids in it. I was originally worried that it might not be strong enough given that 1) the amount of bud I used was on the lower end of the suggested range I had read in the directions, and 2) I was using 151 proof alcohol rather than 190 proof, meaning there was less solvent per volume than the recipe suggested. My fears, it turns out, were without basis.One night my roommate and some friends decided it was time to try it. I mixed two ounces of the green dragon with lemon lime soda and cranberry juice. It tasted really interesting, like cannabis but not like the cannabis in cookies or brownies often tastes. I've found that in food the cannabis taste is something that I want to cover up, it can taste a little burnt, kind of like licking the bottom of a bowl. In the drink it was much fresher and more inviting. I began sipping the drink and, about halfway through it (15 minutes or so) I started to notice the primary effects. My stomach was completely empty, though, so this may be faster than should generally be expected. By the time I was finished the effects were in full force.It was the level of high that comes with eating brownies or doing deep bong hits: very strong with a high body component. The effects of the alcohol were much less pronounced than the effects of the cannabis, but were pleasant enough--enough to take the 'edge' off an intense high, but not enough to make me feel noticeably drunk or queasy. The proportions of THC and alcohol seemed just about right to me: it's easy enough to throw in a little vodka or have another drink, but it would be unfortunate if you didn't have the option of feeling the special effects of the green dragon without getting completely drunk.We tried watching a movie, but I completely lacked the ability to focus on the plot and had no idea what was goin on most of the time. As I said, I'm pretty experienced with cannabis. I tend to have a good deal of mental control when I smoke, so this was unusual for me. My thoughts meandered and became very confused but playful, all more so than when I normally smoke.I can't give a very accurate timeline because I went to sleep about three hours after beginning to imbibe, but I was still very much in the plateau portion of the experience then. It was definitely a longer experience than smoking, but I can't say with certainty how it compares with other methods of ingestion. Considering my state of mind going to bed, I would guess the total time would be comparable to or slightly less than eating brownies.For all of those out there looking for something new and interesting to do with cannabis, I recommend trying green dragon. It tastes great, works great, and makes a great conversation piece. Setting: in my studio flat with a recently acquired male friendI am a 23-year-old female (22 at the time of the below mentioned salvia event) with a fairly respectable quota of psychedelic experiences. Aside from the usual suspects, namely tobacco, cannabis and alcohol, my trips prior to the below mentioned incident had involved drugs such as magic mushrooms (a few different sorts), amphetamine (the street variety), MDMA crystals, ecstasy, H.B. woodrose seeds, herbal ecstasy and 20x salvia extract. At 02:45 in the morning of a few months ago, my friend B and I decided rather spontaneously to have a go at my 40x salvia divinorum extract. We had been drinking and talking all night and, as is often the case for me, drugs had featured solidly in many of the conversations. B had tried salvia only once before and had found it quite frightening; I, by contrast, have tried 20x extract twice and whilst it was definitely strong and utterly unique, I had not experienced anything close to what I’d heard is possible with salvia. I am extremely curious about drugs and have always taken them in order to explore my mind and the 'supernatural' (or perhaps 'beyond immediately obvious') qualities of the world rather than for social purposes. I enjoy experimenting with drugs on my own and in the case of salvia I have come to hypothesise that for me it is in fact advisable to do so, as my trips have consistently involved a particularly unsettling form of paranoia, generally exacerbated by real-life company. I am by nature a socially paranoid person (delusional OCD-type notions of people scrutinising me at all times featured heavily in my childhood) and I have an inkling that this may have caused me to respond to this salvia trip in the particular manner described below.In any which case: at a quarter to three in the morning B and I tracked down my elusive pipe filters, excitedly poured one fourth of my one gram salvia vial into my pipe – forgetting to line the bottom with tobacco as I did the other two times I tried this absurd drug – and turned down the volume of the television. A music channel was screening the video of some nondescript boyband, but in spite of the fact that I had both heard and experienced that salvia decreases appreciation of music I decided to leave it playing so as to keep B relatively entertained; he was planning on waiting with taking his hit until after I had had mine, and I felt it would be best to avoid adding 'oh-no-he's-bored!'-sentiments to whatever other feelings the salvia might trigger. I also opened a new Word document in case I would want to write something during my trip, which I had done on the two previous occasions. Finally I tied my ankle to my desk leg, as has so far always been my salvia-specific custom – much as I (somewhat) trusted B to prevent me from jumping out the window or otherwise injuring myself, I like to remain on the cautious side, particularly with drugs that strike fear deep into my heart the way salvia does. My hand was trembling slightly as I brought the pipe to my lips (no other drug induces such terror within me; I had not yet had a bad as opposed to merely unpleasant salvia trip but could easily imagine it happening) and quickly lit the plant material. Taking a deep drag and leaning back in my computer chair, I estimate that I had inhaled about half of the 250 mg. I looked at my mirrored wall clock and counted along with it until I reached about 15 seconds, when I was overcome with that highly particular salvia feel that I have learnt to recognise. It’s a very difficult sensation to describe in spite of it being so tangibly invasive: in essence, it feels as though my auditory and visual realities pulsate and fold inwards with light levels seemingly diminishing to leave an atmospherically brownish-reddish screen covering everything, all the whilst a strange metallic bass beat – presumably my heart, which beats hard and fast during salvia trips – strikes up in the background. I could feel as I was holding in the smoke that I was in for something powerful and after a mere 17 or so seconds I exhaled and started to giggle anxiously. B took the pipe from my outstretched hand then offered it back to me immediately, prompting me to wave my arms in front of my face defensively whilst repeating loudly, 'Hah! Hah! No! No more! Fuck! Never touching that again!' The next thing I remember – at around T+00:01 if you'll allow a wild guess – is looking at the TV, where three or four boyband members were standing with their arms around each other's shoulders looking out at me and laughing in a disturbing, maniacal fashion, like the cave ghosts in the third Lord of the Rings film. Some sort of wall ran from the TV through me and on to and through B who was standing behind me to my right. This wall - which seemed to be connected in some absurd and indescribable way to my eyes and the roof of my mouth - was about a metre or so high, flesh-coloured, of indefinable thickness, had a wavy top edge and seemed to signify the border of reality. As I realised this, something quite unlike anything I have ever experienced before happened: still hearing that metallic bass music overlaid with scarcely humanoid rhythmic laughter, I suddenly realised that the group of men on the television were talking directly to me. B was also talking – I’m not sure if he was actually talking in real time, although I do know from what he told me later that he was laughing hysterically due to having thoughtlessly smoked some salvia himself in the midst of my trip – and I realised that they were all telling me that my whole life had in fact been nothing but an illusion; a cruel joke. The sensation of white-hot terror and grief running through me in that moment cannot possibly be put into words. My personality, memories, friends and family – none of whom I was able to recall – had been nothing but a product of my imagination, as vapid and unreal as a psychedelic trip can appear when scrutinised from a sober standpoint. B and the boyband all told me that they had come to take me away to 'real' Existence, apparently residing in some super-dimensional parallel universe located through and beyond my laptop (incidentally not perceived by me as a functional machine at the time); the flesh-coloured curly-topped wall running through me was to be used to drag me forward and to the right into this new world, where I would finally be taught what life actually is. The reality their strange, neither two- nor three-dimensional, flesh-coloured appearance and mocking tones hinted at seemed so much more real in its brutal rawness than my current one that I did not doubt them for a second. There was no questioning it at all, as opposed to sober reality which I am forever questioning, and the feeling of cold shock at the thought of having been abandoned by reality itself was... well, truly something else. At this point I had no concept whatsoever of the fact that I had smoked salvia only a couple of minutes previously. B told me afterwards that I was looking very KO’d indeed throughout most of the trip, what with slouching over the desk, staring fixedly at the TV and groaning. Throughout the peak of the experience I kept hearing that very loud, rhythmic sound; it was tinny, metallic and of low frequency, and there seemed to be incoherent voices mingled inside it. The handful of flashbacks from this sound that I experienced in the days following the trip rang bells of odd, creepy familiarity in my brain, but I have not been able to place what the voices were saying and what the sound resembled. As I was going through all this, B took a couple of tokes of what was remaining in the pipe. He told me afterwards that there had been quite a lot left in it and that he had decided to take some immediately after I put the pipe down. The trip he subsequently had was entirely different from mine: he was standing up at the time of smoking, and he later divulged to me that it had felt as though his body was folded up by means of some sort of metal-like contraption, after which 'someone' or 'something' attempted to ship it, or its folded constituents, off to some sort of warehouse. He swears that had he smoked more, his folded body really would have been sent out through the window to who knows where. The very instant that I re-attained some sort of perception that the threat of The Wall and That Other Dimension were not necessarily real, at about T+0:03-0:05, I flew up from the computer chair and ran over to the couch, where I curled up with my legs beneath me all the while hyperventilating and laughing hysterically. B was standing in front of me looking quite confused, not quite paying attention to my shocked tirade of what an incredible experience I had just had. I quickly regained a shaky concept of my regular reality, however I was still feeling decidedly outer-worldly and kept repeating aloud, 'I am still tripping. I am still not here.' B, in turn, paced back and forth across the floor, nervous and unsettled as we were discussing what we had each just been through, and suddenly he had what he would later describe as a revelation of some sort. I can’t remember what he said at the time but at one point he exclaimed something in a stunned voice and stumbled backwards (according to him it felt as though he’d been pushed backward forcefully) and hit my desk with his hands and backside. In that instant the signal went out on the television, as though the aerial had been pulled out, as the cables had not been disturbed. Try as we might, we never found the source of this disturbance, and when I switched it off and back on again a few minutes later it worked fine.Another interesting thing was how different B’s and my relationship seemed during this comedown, which lasted for about 10-15 minutes after the peak: in real-time we had only known each other for a couple of weeks, but during the comedown it felt as though we were sharing another dimensional space that we had visited together before. From as far as I can tell, this type of experience is not unusual with salvia: I wonder, for instance, if the perceived reality wall pushing or dragging me forward was a variant of the well-known 'folding reality' trip, and I have further speculated that it may have been visually exacerbated by the fact that I was sitting facing a corner of my room. The sensation could quite possibly have taken on a different quality had I been outside in an open space. As previously stated, I also think that the trip played on my childhood fear (whilst not recognised as a genuine fear at the time due to it being slightly too unlikely to be truly believable) of a worldwide conspiracy against me personally.Baseline was reached within the hour, by which point a sense of physical and mental exhaustion was the only thing remaining of the trip. I was visited by flashbacks for weeks afterwards, although none were so invasive as to actually disturb normal functioning. Whilst B found the experience predominantly unsettling, I consider it one of the most incredible experiences of my life, and I hope to one day be brave and comfortable enough to try twice that dose. 0:00h – I ingested 90mL of 40% alcohol for the first time on an empty stomach with some friends.~0:05h – There is a warm feeling in my throat, face, and stomach due to the dilation of capillaries and the irritating effects of the alcohol. There is also a mild sense of well being, nothing major at this point.~0:10h – The effects are apparent now, I am dizzy, red in the face, euphoric, and am noticing a loss of inhibition.~0:30h – We decide to go for a walk, walking is not difficult but my balance is off, my vision has become blurry and it is hard to focus. I notice I am a lot more social than I would be otherwise I am also in a lot less control of my person, I like my inhibitions.~1:00h – The effects are mostly the same at this point, it is pleasurable, there is a pleasant feeling throughout my body but I am not able to let go of the feeling that I am not in control, I suppose if you where to drink enough this feeling would go away and you wouldn’t care, but I don’t find that to be a desirable effect.~2:00h – I am slowly regaining control, the experience has not been overly intense, but I was able to get a feel for the drug, and can extrapolate what a higher dosage would be like, I don’t think I will be trying more anytime soon.~4:00h – Baseline.Aftereffects – I feel fine today, there was no hangover but I didn’t expect one from the amount I ingested. Alcohol is a very interesting substance, it is a depressant and yet most people don’t even consider it to be a drug. Although I found my experience enjoyable I did not like the loss of inhibitions associated with it, anything that can make you lose control like that scares me. [Will be referring to Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds as HB’s throughout]Date of experience: 11 August 2007Age: 22Gender: femalePrevious experience: alcohol, magic mushrooms, weed, speed, MDMA powder, ecstasy, herbal ecstasy, H.B. woodroseSetting: in my messy but beloved studio flat, alone. Had not eaten for about six hours beforehand. Prior to taking the HB’s, consumed one 70cl bottle of 5.1% vol. alcopop and three glasses of vodka mixed with an energy drink over a period of six hours.Mood: somewhat sleep-deprived, a bit ill with a cold and generally feeling quite amused with but detached from reality.Expectation: low. Suspecting that my last HB trip may have been due in part to a slight fever. Wanting to do something creative during my trip, if it does occur, to truly capture it and try to do it justice.T=0:00It’s 2:45 in the morning and I have decided to take two HB’s to examine how they mix with alcohol. Removed husks, chewed well and kept in my mouth for about 30 seconds, quite possibly less – I find the taste sickening. T=0:05Supposed placebo effect playing up: I’m experiencing disorientation, a sense of impending nausea and mild dissociation. Having another drink, this time vodka coke. Feeling rushes of exhilarating, almost dizzying come-up effects. I’m not too familiar with the effect of the seeds so I can’t tell if the sensation is real or imagined. Also feeling slightly nauseous, as expected: a sickening sensation is creeping down into my arms, not unlike when I’m about to faint. Wavering between going to the bathroom and staying in my chair waiting it out. Feeling very depersonalised, as though I’m just a pair of eyes rather than a subjective individual. Switching from hard-trance to a somewhat softer type of trance (Underworld, to be specific) appears to alleviate the nausea somewhat.T=0:30Am feeling cold – in stark contrast to last time I took HB’s when I felt very warm. Briefly amused by a TV program about great football goals – it was showing last time I took HB’s and I loved it. I still find it funny but I’m not getting any laughing kicks this time. I suspected HB’s and alcohol would not mix well for me, and my instinct appears to have been correct. It’s like my soul has been disconnected from my body. I’m feeling the effect of the seeds coming on properly now: I keep closing my eyes to float off into my own strangely dark and shapeless but comforting world. T=0:45Taking another seed – probably ill-advised seeing as I’m already feeling sick. The seed tastes bitter and foul and I swallow it almost immediately. Getting some water. The water tastes good but I’m still feeling nauseous. Struggling to turn my thoughts inward. I’m guessing this is caused by the alcohol as I had no such problems last time I took HB’s. Short-term memory obviously affected: rolled two roaches for one cigarette without realising (note: I use roaches for cigarettes as well as joints, the latter of which I smoke very rarely – more due to lack of access than lack of want). Currently blowing smoke-rings and indulging in their beauty.T=1:00Went to throw up as my body seemed to be begging me to expel some substances. Was unable to vomit properly and the “nauseous” feeling in my arms remains, however at the same time I’m enveloped in a sense of contentment and euphoria. Noticing a mild double vision effect in that the black-on-white letters on the computer screen appear shaded, and colours and sounds also appear very sharpened. I’m regretting slightly having presumably dimmed the effect with alcohol.T=1:15Feel compelled to close my eyes and trip. No CEV’s whatsoever but it’s still very pleasurable. My body feels content and cosy: I’m sitting practically horizontally on my computer chair and my thigh is complaining, but I barely notice. My sister is playing scrabble online and when she presents to me a sequence of letters over instant messenger I find myself able to rearrange them very easily in my head. Memories are also extremely clear in my mind, right down to the smallest detail. I can’t quite choose which ones to display but the ones I’m touching upon are pleasant and very vivid. They relate more to the general scenario at the time than to a particular feeling but the clarity is such that they are captivating regardless. T=1:25Losing concept of time and am struggling to calculate how long it’s been since my first dose. I’m feeling good: the sense of nausea remains but it’s not overpowering. I’m not smoking much and I feel quite disgusted by the thought of having more alcohol.Enjoying music a lot. It doesn’t take on as much depth and significance as it does with MDMA, but it sounds beautiful. I’m still feeling unpleasantly cold even though I’m wearing a sweater. Donning a robe. Suddenly I’m back in the town where I lived four years ago. The strength of the memory is distracting. Feeling pleasantly lethargic: relaxation quite unlike what I’ve ever felt before. I keep getting distracted by mundane objects, not because they’re interesting but because my eyes just glue to them and don’t let go.T=1:45Still struggling with calculating time-lines. Also still speaking to my sister, with which I have no problems whatsoever even though I’m feeling distinctly off baseline. I’m getting the pixellated mushroom effect: everything appears overlaid with a thin web of geometric patterns. Feeling giggly. Not quite able to control what mental images to view, so I’m just enjoying them as they come. The visuals are almost exclusively memories and not the swirling-colours-and-breathing-walls ones I know from mushrooms. Overall I’m having a very pleasant experience. I can feel no alcohol effects whatsoever at present. T=2:00Completely lost concept of time – I have to count on my fingers to calculate the time-line. My body feels incredibly heavy. Leant back in my chair for a minute, arms hanging limply by my sides, and felt like I could stay like that forever. Going to switch the lights off. Shit. Keep freezing physically. Not quite seizing up but something similar. Went to throw up and sat hugging the toilet bowl for a few minutes, experiencing the overlay web-effect especially strongly (as I always do in bathrooms – presumably due to the brightness of the tiles and porcelain). The nausea has magically vanished and now a smile is literally plastered to my face. I realise I should be worried as I’m going to a party tomorrow at four (it’s now 4:55 a.m.) and I want to look and seem at least human, but somehow I just don’t care. I have an amazing view of the impending sunrise from my room. The sky appears very two-dimensional but incredibly beautiful, however the realisation that I am too tired and distracted to make something creative out of this sunrise – like a painting or even a drawing – makes me feel melancholic. I change the music from Underworld to Infected Mushroom, infusing me with a sense of novelty and interest.T=2:40Feeling physically fine – good, even – but mentally I am slightly confused. I keep being assailed by memories: currently I am seeing the garden of the house where I grew up. I can see the neighbouring garden and nearby playground very clearly, and sharp as a photograph is the small patch of forest where I used to play and the collection of bushes where my beloved feline would lie watching over us all. I can definitely see the use of LSA as a therapeutic aid – with a bit of guidance, I imagine it could lead to some serious personal revelations, especially with regard to retracing old memories. Currently deeply contemplative.Cigarette smoke looks absolutely beautiful. Contrasting the effect with mushrooms, I don’t have such  a sense of the borderline supernatural: with mushrooms (specifically Mexicans – on Hawaiians I experienced little more than disturbingly invasive visuals and a feeling of sickening restlessness) I always had a deep sense of togetherness with the Universe in all its beauty. I’m experiencing a similar sensation now but am somehow completely detached at the same time. In a lot of ways I would consider this trip stronger than mushrooms, but it feels more controlled and there isn’t such a sense of all-encompassing awe – also, it was years ago that I last took mushrooms (tragically), and perhaps I’m not doing them justice. Am continuously stroking my legs in an autoerotic fashion.T=3:15My gender means very little to me at the moment. I’ve experienced that sensation on mushrooms before: I know I am straight, and female, but I seem to lose touch with my gender identity very easily, almost as if my soul is inherently sexless. I can’t quite identify myself with my name either (experienced many times before on mushrooms) but I feel that I know myself on a level so deep as to be positively profound. Speaking of profound, I am unexpectedly burdened by a profound sense of loss. All the memories shooting though me – my beautiful childhood, my first love, my first experience with soft drugs, hard drugs, university, loss of friends, gaining of friends, loss of relationships – make me feel absolutely sick with loss and mysterious longing. I am struggling under a cloud of memory overload. Almost exclusively neutral ones but it’s difficult to take them all in. Having another glass of vodka coke at T=3:25. I could feel a vague heartburn sensation approaching as I was about to pour the alcohol and am guessing that it was psychosomatically induced. Noticing that my visual acuity is incredibly precise but my peripheral vision is all but nonexistent.T=3:30My left arm is feeling tingly and strange. Immediately fears of cardiac arrest enter my mind, but upon feeling my pulse I find that it’s steady. Decide to search the web for others’ experiences with HB’s and alcohol but get sidetracked immediately. I think I’m coming down slightly. I feel sad that I haven’t drawn anything whilst tripping – I really wanted to but I’ve not felt able to somehow. Just drew a picture of myself standing on a free-floating plateau watching Earth from a distance. The idea behind it feels supremely apt but my drawing style is very abstract and ugly. I am also much too meticulous about my precise vision to enjoy drawing. Having strong flashbacks to my last trip, where I felt like I was standing on the brink of another dimension. Every single word I read, every single thing I see appears to me like a sharp, tangible message from that Other Side. I am again experiencing the grotesque feeling of ultra-real familiarity that intrigued me so much during my first HB trip. It is not necessarily pleasant but I can’t help but feel drawn to it. T=3:30-4:00 My mirror image looks aesthetically beautiful, smooth and vague like a painting. I, however, feel like an apparition. I feel like a shadow. I feel like a ghost. I feel like I am not here. The notion of “I” has lost its meaning entirely. I am experiencing a mild case of ego-death – mild because I’m sure it could be even more profound, even more all-consuming. I would rate my current high as a +3 but I should note that the strongest substances I have taken besides this one are MDMA, psilocybin and amphetamine. I want to try LSD some time: I used to think that it would be too strong for me but now I think I can handle it. In fact, I think I am mentally much stronger than I ever realised.Some words – such as “too”, “me”, “life”, “but”, “normal” – affect me so deeply that it’s an actual, physical struggle to write them. A bit of net surfing reveals that my vision is extremely two-dimensional. Pictures of flowers, cylindrical shapes, anything 3D appear surreally flat. Only semantics allows me to comprehend what the pictures actually represent. It’s no wonder that I am unable to draw at the moment: the inspiration is there but I have no sense of visual depth. Very painful headache, almost turning migraine-like with my left eye tearing up. No more alcohol for me. T=4:15Intense trailing effect. Everything is still overlaid by a shimmering web and the two-dimensionality is still as present as ever. I do have some control over it but not much. Still experiencing a distinct sense of ego-death. I’ll be surprised if this high doesn’t affect my personality in some very real way. My hands have strange black marks all over them, like soot. I have no clue where I got them from. Actually, wait, that was stupid: it’s obviously from when I was drawing.Flashbacks of ships, sledging, gravel roads, forests, losing things, finding things. My whole life. I often think of the meaning of my existence, but never like this. I have the answer. It’s right there in front of me and I can’t question it: it just is, and I just am, and that thought is so frightening, so awful, so terrifying that I feel physically crushed by its weight. But I still find life beautiful. I can still enjoy it. It still has meaning to me. Drinking some water to combat extreme thirst. It tastes very good and looks beautiful. I feel very tearful. T=4:45Memories are still very, very clear but neutral, like photographs. Only by logic can I attribute feeling to them. That other dimension I keep sensing is the world I experience in my dreams. I know they are actual realities, I just don’t know if they are real in the same way as my sober world is real. T=5:00Coming down, almost suddenly. It’s now 7:45 a.m. and I feel very similar to how I felt 30 minutes into the trip. I’m exhausted in a fairly pleasant way. The prospect of the party later today should worry me but I have a feeling that my sleep will be very restful and satisfying. After-effects:It’s now been 48 hours since the initiation of my trip. I struggled to fall asleep and lay awake reading for about two hours after going to bed, finding the characters in the book very sympathetic and real. Once sleep came it was deep and restful: when I woke up at four the next afternoon I felt better than I normally would have after such a limited period of sleep, as well as slightly euphoric and gently amused by life in general. I did find it a little difficult to relate to people at the party I went to at first, but eventually I ended up drinking a lot of alcohol and having quite a good time – I did bawl miserably for 15 minutes or so when I came home, but that is not uncommon for me when drinking.Now, two days after the trip, I feel completely back to baseline but some fuzziness is definitely present, and I’m feeling a little emotionally tumble-dried. I have decided that fascinating as the effects of HB’s are, I cannot continue to take them weekly – they’re just too strong and I could easily see myself overusing them as the effect is so interesting whilst not being as debilitating as that of mushrooms. As a personal input, I consider Tramadol to be very beneficial to my mood. I typically ingest 100mg doses at least three times a week with occasional 2-week breaks in which I don't crave it and don't experience any withdrawal symptoms. Being very cheap in Costa Rica, I'm surprised to have never found anyone who has ever even heard of it despite its powerful mood-lifting effects, specially when combined with alcohol.From my experiences, I gather that Tramadol in 100mg dosages gives me a very nice and positive mood lift, makes movement feel very pleasant (dancing to electronic music on Tramadol feels almost like a light dose of MDMA). I have also experienced with similar states induced by Codeine - typically ingesting 60mg of Codeine along with 1g of Acetaminophen which I have so far not tried to separate from Codeine since I've read on Erowid that the resulting liquid is bitter-tasting and difficult to measure, whereas the tiny green and yellow caps are found in any pharmacy with no questions askedand for very cheap.I commonly experience a significant reduction in my sex-drive when under the influence of Tramadol, specially after 4 hours into the experience. However I have managed to have sex in these experiences, although I would definitely say the relaxed state doesn't favor pumping of the blood into masculine sexual organs and therefore erections aren't very stiff and sometimes a little difficult to achieve.Combining the drug with marijuana and alcohol commonly results in a very funny mind state in which I lose inhibition and it stimulates my irreverent mind into a very creative and entertaining experience. I find it difficult though to concentrate these creative energies into a project like music-making or writing. I have a little difficulty keeping a steady pace of speech and I commonly find myself side-tracking into jokes, funny expressions or faces when trying to tell a story. I have also found that the thresholds for alcohol and marijuana to be effective while under Tramadolare considerably reduced: when I would typically smoke 3-4 bong hits to get high when sober, it only takes one puff / toke / bong hit to send me to THC-land, and its effects are 'foggy' and shorter.I cannot judge its addictive potential (if any) but I can relate to Tramadol being very different than Codeine (its opiate analog) addiction. I have experienced severe itchiness on the body, specially in the morning, from Codeine usage but never from Tramadol. The only negative effects I have ever felt have been mild lethargy the day after a typical 100mg dose and occasionally nausea / vomiting after a 100mg dose of Tramadol accompanied with marijuana and alcohol.As a painkiller, no doubt. Tramadol is a very effective way of 'anesthetizing' dental pain, muscle aches and skeletal-related discomfort like bruises and joint aches but it's not as effective for headaches or stomach aches. In fact, I have found it to slightly make headaches stand out and forcing me to use analgesics like Aspirin or Acetaminophen.  I don't take the tramadol tablets that also contain Acetaminophen to avoid possible hepatoxicity issues.Summarizing, Tramadol is a very enjoyable and long-lasting drug for me. I usually can't experience its comedown since it makes me very drowsy towards the end, requiring me to lay down and fall into a deep, relaxing sleep state. I haven't found any effects on dreaming, save perhaps more difficulty from remembering my dreams, though this could be caused by marijuana. Hi! I am writing to share my story here. I am a 26 year old U.S. Army veteran, I am still in the army reserves and I have been to Iraq. I am mostly posting this here because hopefully somebody who probably drives under the influence can read this, look at their choices from a different angle, and maybe think twice about driving drunk/high. About 5 months ago, I became the victim of a drunk driver. I was returning home from work when I was plowed into by a woman in a truck who was driving drunk and with no insurance. This person should not have been driving in the first place. She has/had a prior history of delinquency, and this was not her first infraction.What sucks is that because she was able to produce an insurance card at the scene (which was bogus or expired), she has not and will not be cited for driving without insurance. I have brought this up with my lawyer, the attorney general and the detective handling this case. Evidently, this is only a Class C misdemeanor and 'not that big a deal' according to them.What's worse, it somehow took my law firm over a month to tell me that she had no insurance coverage at the time. According to them it had 'just lapsed'. But whatever. This can be turned into a 'trip report' or sorts, delving deeply into some of the shifts in consciousness I underwent during this very unpleasant ordeal.Although I came out of it with serious but reversable injuries (and a few permanent ones), I was actually very fortunate to have survived such a devestating and brutal physical trauma. Here's how it happened:The time is midnight.I was standing at a crosswalk when I was struck so suddenly and so violently. Almost every bone in my face was broken, my left wrist and fingers were severly fractured, my right forearm was broken with bones poking through the skin, my ribs were cracked, my left leg was in quite a bit of pain, amy front teeth were knocked out and I was choking on my own blood. I was conscious the whole time I was waiting for the ambulance with some people who were on the scene, who off course helped me out by calling 911.The moment I saw her running the red light, and saw her vehicle run into somebody else's, then spin in the air towards me (this all happened in a split second, mind you) I briefly thought 'Dam, I am witnessing a crazy accident'...BLAM!The bitch ended up almost hitting a gas pump, but not before hitting my body, which knocked me back about 60 feet or so. I don't recall if I was ever unconscious, I doubt it. The next thing I remember is standing up, facing the other direction and just being in such intense, undescribable pain that all I could do was yell. I screamed and I yelled VERY LOUDLY, sort of a primal expression of intense anger and I don't know what. it truely defies adjectives, to tell you the truth.Somebody crossing the street with a cell phone saw me, and asked what was wrong or said something I don't remember. I was just so adrenal this whole thing seemed impossible. Almost like a dream. I specifically remember that at one point I thought I was watching a movie of this, or dreaming or tripping or SOMETHING. there was a concept of 'do I deserve this, I just got hit by a fucking truck, this only happens in movies' or something like that, but it was all fleeting. I even remember saying at some point that 'I'm gonna die now', and by now there were several people on the scene telling me I would live, and that my arm was just broken and I was bleeding alot and my teeth were knocked out. That the ambulance is on its way. Yeah, I know.On the way to the hospital, on the stretcher, the paramedic kept asking me about my chest and back and legs, asking if it hurt anywhere. I was so concerned with choking on my blood or that I would stop breathing, so I kept having him suction the blood out of my nose and mouth, kept asking him if I was in any danger of choking lol. He kept telling me that he was more concerned with my 'more serious injuries'.The hospital stay was very unpleasant. After my facial surgery, because I had my nose in a splint and my jaws wired shut, they put a tube in my throat so that I could breath. The tracheotomy left me unable to eat or speak for days, and was perhaps the most unpleasant thing about the whole experience. I remember like after the second day of having that tube in, I woke up and asked for more and more benadryl, which they denied me. I just wanted to sleep the whole thing away, as they had informed me I would have the tube in for days. At one point (during which my sister was visiting) I asked one of the nurses how much longer before they took the tube out of my neck. She replied '5 more days'. My sister later told me that right after they told me that, my heart rate went up like 20 points lol! At that moment that was the worst news I had ever heard in my life. I have some vague memories of when they actually originally put in the tube, it was awful. I remember kicking and choking because they stuck a long, thin tube into my throat to 'suction me out' and I remember the doctors saying things like 'he thinks he's choking'. At some point I asked someone if they had given me Ketamine for the surgery, and she was like 'how did you know? Did you hear us'?Both nurses and family members kept commenting on how I looked 'years younger' and 'as if I had botox injections' because of the surgery. I think alot of might have had to do with such a vigorous and extensive water fast. I actually do not consider it a fast, because I only didn't eat (Again, for almost a whole week) and my only sustenance was the I.V. and the few drops of water one nurse would come in and drop into my mouth on like the fourth day. I broke this 'fast' with a Boost shake, which I had to drink out of a straw because my jaws were wired shut.I was fortunate that family members have allowed me to stay at thier places between my trips to my appointments (in a city in which I don't live). I have had to travel by greyhound bus many times, depleting my personal savings funds and borrowing left and right from friends and family members for cab fair and other travel expenses. The 'pain and suffering' portion of all this certainly isn't over. Not by a long shot.It sucks because I am a tax-paying, law abiding citizen who has generally always stayed within the parameters of the law, who has done nothing but fullfill my obligations to the U.S. military, and it is very unfortunate that because somebody else didn't follow the law, I have to suffer for it. I would normally follow regular workout routines and eat a predominatly organic diet, so my health means alot to me. That night, years of hard work and dedication were taken from me. My right arm is still not fully healed, I have a huge and visible scar on my right forearm from the surgery from the surgery, several pieces of plate and metal in my arm and face, and I still have no front teeth. I lost three and a half teeth, and the dentist I saw pretty much described the extent of my injuries as very severe and very complicated. According to him 'it's a very long story'. He says I can't get implants for about a year and in the meantime I have to wear a retainer. Since the accident my jaw is misaligned and will require either surgery or braces to fix, and I will have to spend a long time waiting until this problem gets resolved. Worst of all, I have no financial means to take care of these very expensive procedures.My only hope is that as time goes by my scars will diminish and my injuries will heal more, and that eventually I can go back to a 'normal' life. I am extremely depressed and understandably miffed at times, but it really is hard to pick an emotion to describe how this truly feels.Thank you for reading this, to those who took the time. I have posted this on other forums and will likely post it all over the web, if nothing more than to raise awareness about the damage that can be caused in an instant. Dude, don't drink or drive! You could kill yourself or somebody else. I don't think how 'in control' you think you are. I had no idea I was ever going to take heroin, certainly not that night at a friend's birthday party in a rented hall. New friends in this new country that I'm inviting over this week-end for a taco fiesta in an attempt not to loose them after that horrible night. Sleeping bag in one hand, bottle of rose wine in the other. I was ready to party. After being a big hit on the dance floor, as well as having a blast the time before, nothing hinted that I was about to try the most ill-reputated drug known to the general public.About me. In short, I moved to another country across the Atlantic Ocean just to work the tides as an oyster farmer in these glorious 18 years of mine. I'm very open to existentialist experiences and ideas, so after trying hash for the first time, I became a miscellaneous recreational drug thrill seeker. LSD, mush, weed, more weed, mesc, nutmeg (try it once!), E and various inhalants make up the good times that are my post-boozehound youth (and probably my genetic make-up by now).I've always leered away from drugs that are reputed to be addictive or just plain not worth it (try nutmeg once, I'm serious!). So speed, opiates and crack/cocaine were out of my dossier (and I'm terrified of needles).So I was at a friend's birthday party having a genuinely good time (on my 9th drink I'm guessing, and smoking cigs like hickory) when I see my friend's brother with his buddies tokin some bud. (I'd seen them a few times at the old pub, friendly chaps). I couldn’t help but want to have a taste, so I joined in the discussion. Little time passed before I was handed the joint. I sucked in three huge open lung hauls (with the J a bit away from my lips to let _some_ air through). I noticed a somewhat pleasant metallic taste, but thought nothing of it.As the thick smoke from my final exhalation gave way, the clearing fog produced an unsung chorus of open jawed wide eyes (yes it's possible). 'What's the matter, can't handle a little weed?'. No one laughed. I saw only concerned looks, and almost guilt from the person who had produced the J. I thought to myself 'This might not be bad, but it probably won't be good.' Rough French to English translation: 'Dude, we thought you knew. That shit is laced with heroin.'Ack.In my mind, I wrestled myself to be calm. I thought about heroin being the one drug I swore I would never even be in the same room with, but what was done was done. I decided to play it cool and just enjoy it however I could.The fact that I didn't feel anything (apart from the usual effect for weed and alcohol) relaxed me a bit. Maybe I was tougher than these guys, or maybe what they think is heroin is just scraps a dealer threw in to raise the price. Hell as far as I knew it couldn't be smoked, only injected or evaporated. So party on I did. I drank another beer. I was enjoying their company and we were having motivated conversations (don't ask me about em I can't remember). So when he rolled another one, I gladly took part in the consumption. Even if it was low grade weed and may have heroin in it, it was just for one night, and besides it tasked good. I had about two more alcoholic drinks. I even rolled another one with the roaches. Pretty well too, considering how drunk and stoned I was (and the fact that I couldn't roll a nice joint if my life depended on it).What I can remember of what came next is a bit fleeting. I still had nothing of what I knew being on heroin was, but I wasn't very conscious. I remember arm wresting and beating everyone and feeling like a god. And quick flashes of people dancing. Admitting that these guys could drink and smoke me under the table. And suddenly I was alone.I knew where I was, sitting right in my chair. I could tell only by my sense of balance that my head was resting against my arm. I figured I was in my favorite sleep-in-school position, urban sprawled legs and everything. Happy to have regained some bearings I decided open my eyes and have a peep at the world. Wow! It may have been dark in the hall but my shirt and legs emitted pure white light, as if the sun was bouncing off of fresh fallen Canadian snow on a dry, cloudless -33'C mid-morning.It took some getting used too, but finally it was very soothing. I told myself that my shirt was actually dark green (as it was), so I concentrated until my eyesight came back to normal. Doing that felt like someone had walked into my room and ripped off my blankets; so quickly I 'got back into bed' without any trouble and felt safe again. Next I noticed how my hearing sounded as if I was under water. Just for trying's sake I listened until the voices and music were comprehensible again. Not as violent this time, but the noise was more of a chilly draft. So I shut the window.I made it a point to tell myself that this is what it must be like to be on the nod. My thoughts were clear, and I felt warm, relaxed and safe. But instead of letting the trip take it’s course, I decided to analyze the situation globally. It occurred to me that 12 drinks and some marijuana would make me very sick (since I’ve lost 30 lbs harvesting oysters, rough work). Yet I felt nothing, my stomach wasn't aching, I didn't need to pee. This got me a little worried. 12 drinks wouldn't kill me, but a ruptured bladder just might. I left my world just long enough to check that I was okay, I was.So now I could understand why people did heroin. Put simply, it's for the bliss. I imagined being the poor, homeless Chinese man I saw do heroin in a documentary one time. I imagined heating some heroine on tinfoil and inhaling it to be completely free of pain, debt, fear, memories, self.I told myself how I didn't deserve this drug. How I was a young, fortunate, healthy man. How I knew that chronic use of heroin would destroy me physically (and financially). I knew that I would never be so bad off to need it, unless I fell terminally ill or something. There are other, more recreational drugs for adding spice to dull lives. But heroin is to be left alone and respected. And finally I told myself that if I still didn't need to pee by now, it's that my liver got fed up with me and long ago told my stomach to stop letting anything through.Effectively speaking, the second my buddy came by to see how I was hanging and slapped me on the back it all fell apart. I could only feel a warm stew creeping up my chest and slowly spewing out of my mouth onto the table. I had snapped out of it, but I was still quite drunk and somewhat stoned. They took me outside and laid me down on the gravel to get some air. I asked for water. They must have all partied pretty hard cause only half of what they poured landed near my mouth. Still, anything to clean my mouth of the vomit would make me feel better, and it did. I still didn't have it in me to move. So the cold winter air got to me fast and I started shivering. I could just feel them freak so I managed to reassure them that it was the cold, and that I felt better. I had to be assisted to the back entrance upon orders from the owner of the hall.There I sat in a plastic lawn chair, regaining myself fairly quickly. I impressed my friends when I got up to take a leak (later they told be how it was like I stopped being sick and drunk for like 30 seconds just to go pee. I'm convinced it was the marijuana, gives me a strong mindset). When I recovered enough, they got my bed set up for me. I was dead tired; I can barely remember smelling my pillow before falling asleep.*epilogue*I rose a bit dizzy the next morning. Still; feeling very ashamed. It was my fault pretty much. Though no one held it against me, I could tell I had some people worried (others annoyed). I decided to be less bitter with myself and to consider it a cherish-able experience rather than just getting smashed and being sick. Later that day I got the urges I usually do for my mandatory party smokes. I almost mistook them for a heroin urge. T+0:16: Whoops.  That's slightly odd: I just lost three minutes writing the above (t +13) entry.  I looked at the clock and it said 10:03 PM and looked back what seem like five seconds later and it said 10:06 PM.  Meh.  My imagination is messing with me, I think.T+0:24: I'm going to change up the music here, maybe Pennywise doesn't fit the desired mood.T+0:26: Still, essentially, no change in my state of mind or my perception of reality.  I'm reminded of the axiom, 'A watched pot never boils'.T+0:27:  Well, maybe things seem slightly distant and my fingers feel a bit clumsy typing on the keyboard -- though that could still be residual from the vodka.  I am somewhat drowsy -- not surprising considering the combination of depressants in my system.T+0:34: I regret to report that boredom has eventually overcome caution, and I've taken another pill.  Time was I used to be more reticent to ramp up the doses on my first experience with something, but all signs indicate that 20mg of Ambien won't be an especially high dose.T+0:42: Definitely moving along into the main attraction now.  Probably should've waited on that second pill.  I'm kind of cold for thing, when I wasn't before.  Not sure where my coat is.  Oh right next to me, right.  Lightheadedness.  Typing becoming harded all around -- physically and forming coherent thoughts.  Very uphill battle.T+0:47: Occasionally tracers are entering my vision.  It's suddenly difficult to remember that computer screen is a computer screen, and not a window to an ancient roman city.T +0:51: I'm amazed to discover something that does vaguely resemble a dragonfly in the workings of my cell phone.  I don't know what it does, or how it got there.T+0:53: Motor control is suffering wildly.  Second pill = poor planning.----Now it is the next morning (around 7:15 am).After the last entry above I decided to lie down with a book and some music, since I seemed incapable of much else.I have only the haziest recollections of the rest of the experience -- sort of a feeling of 'Wow, the world never felt like THAT before', but I can't remember any details.So, under the circumstances of my use, at least, I'd give Ambien a very mixed rating.  It's effects took, in retrospect, thirty-five to forty minutes to onset, then escalated for an (indeterminate) while -- no doubt intensified by the second pill.Was it enjoyable?  Not precisely.   The resultant loss of motor control near the end of the experience really dampened my spirits.  I had the feeling that something neat was happening if only I could make my clumsy body turn precisely enough to see it.I do vaguely recall being urged on to various nonsensical actions by people who don't exist (either completely false, or literary figures in some cases).  I have no idea how long that went on for, but it was very curious.Well, not much else to say really.  Would I do it again?  It's possible that I might, if the appropriate situation presented itself, but I have no overriding desire to try it again. My very first drug (taken for something other than relieving a headache or travel sickness) was alcohol. I had my first taste at age 15 when my father took me on a camping trip. I used to love these trips and they still ring in my head as my best life experiences. The sun would look so bright and a crisp blue sky would make me pause and appreciate its simple beauty. I can remember my father in his former youth partying 'till dawn and howling at the moon with me. My REAL friends, or so it seemed then, were in their thirties or forties and drinking with them seemed a natural phase in becoming a man, and more importantly then, having fun. My real life did not provide much fun. I could go into details about abuse at school, divorced parents, and other cliche moments, but this story is about the drugs. Fast forward about 3 years. I started smoking cigarettes in my senior year of high school. My mindset then was that I didn't really care about what would happen to me if I smoked. All the stuff that my parents and school had taught me meant nothing because really... I just didn't care. (I would later realize that I was depressed). Another 9 years pass. The alcohol and cigarettes continue. The alcohol peaked during and after high school when we all feel young and invincible. At the age of 27 I was stabilized with alcohol at 18-24 'light' (around 4% alc/vol) beers every weekend and nothing during the week. I was smoking about a pack per week of cigarettes (not bad for almost 10 years of smoking). I was living my life, but that's about it. I could not sleep properly due to frequent bouts of insomnia usually lasting a few days at a time. I was suffering from major depression (the sun looked as if I was always wearing sunglasses and the blue sky seemed always gray.) and I had a nearly uncontrollable rage. I wasn't at the point of hurting other people (myself... yes for sure) but I was swearing at my job in front of customers, punching walls, throwing things, etc. I knew I needed to fix things before I lost my job. At age 28 I started smoking weed. I had taken the cannabis route in earlier years and it had always made me sick, but 28 seemed to be the magic age. The weed took care of the insomnia problems, and gave me something to look forward to at the end of the day. This was all good for a while, but life was still basically shit. Depression owned most of my thoughts and the rage was unaffected by the weed or any other drug I was taking. If anything, the weed was making the depression worse. I finally went to see a doctor after constant hounding from my girlfriend. I don't 'DO' the whole doctor thing, so this was a fairly new experience for me. I waited 30 minutes after my appointment for my doctor who basically spent five minutes with me and gave me a prescription. I had compiled a list of symptoms and written them down on a piece of paper for my appointment. I didn't even get a chance to address the list with the doctor. He could see that I was stressed and depressed. My BP was 180 over 120 and he seemed to ignore my mention of occasional cardiac arrhythmia. My doctor said it could be a side effect of my alcohol consumption and advised me to cut down or avoid alcohol. He said nothing about tobacco or cannabis. He prescribed Effexor (XR) at 37.5 mg/day with a sample pack that had 7-37.5mg pills and 7-75-mg pills. I could almost hear his wallet expand with drug rep kickback dollars. I was told to take the 37.5's for one week and see him again. Day 1 - Monday - I took the pill and I actually felt excited about what was going to happen. I figured this would solve my problems and make the sun bright and the sky blue again. No discernible effect though. No alcohol on this day.Days 2-4 - Taking the Effexor as prescribed I felt only what I would describe as a placebo effect. I thought I was supposed to start feeling better so I did, a little little bit.Day 5 - Friday! - The weekend has come. I have been taking the Effexor as directed, but tonight I smoke about 2/3 of a joint as well. No unusual reaction at all.Day 6 - Saturday - I go to a friends house and he has beer. A LOT of beer, so I start drinking. After beer number 4 I suddenly feel very overheated. I start to sweat and shake a bit. I excuse myself to the washroom and then as I close the door behind me I begin to feel really sick (like I used to back in the day when I would get way too drunk or high). I puke instantly and then hang in the washroom for about ten minutes to puke twice more. After the last barf session I feel remarkably good! I return to the livingroom with my friends who are concerned and I tell them that I might have just had a reaction from alcohol and my 'meds' (effexor) and I feel fine. I DID feel fine. I felt GREAT! I was so pleasantly buzzed and relaxed then. It was a good night.Day 8 - Monday - Back to the doctor I go. He asks me how I am feeling and he seems more pleasant this time (maybe now he likes me more now, now that I am a monetary contributor to his favorite drug company) and this time my BP is at 160 over 100. (I'm still not sure what normal BP should be... maybe I need a different doctor.) He raises my daily dose to 75mg/day and sends me on my merry way for 2 more weeks.Day 10 - Wednesday - At 487.5 mg total consumption I actually start to feel a real effect from the Effexor. I experience drowsiness, but in a nice tingly way. This is the type of drowsiness I feel when I wake up after a good nights sleep in a comfortable bed. I could easily deal with this side effect since it was the only one I was feeling. I also noticed that I was much less prone to road rage and daily annoyances. I had not consciously evaluated my depression at this time. Day 11 - Thursday - Is this the cure? The switch to 75mg/day seemed to be working. I saw the sky again and I felt a weird sensation almost like I was a kid again when I was driving to work. The brief sunlight (I live on the west coast so rain is prevalent) was as bright as I remember summer vacation from high school being. I began to reminisce about my youth, but ONLY the good things. My attitude was so positive that I felt almost, but not quite, 'giddy' most of the time. Day 12 - Friday - Party on. I smoked about 3 joints (maybe a gram and a half) of weed and drank 11 beers. I felt great! I was so high and drunk and happy. I began to praise the effects of the Effexor (even though I knew it was the party drugs that gave me the real high) The rest of the weekend (including Sunday) was pretty much the same.Day 15 - Monday - I am at work and I actually am enjoying being there, but... the annoyances hit me just as hard as they used to. I find this odd. I revert back to my old 'self' and bang my head on my office door and go on a ridiculous diatribe about difficult customers. The major difference is that I am able to recognize the foolishness of my actions and stop them immediately.Day 19 - Friday - No more work incidents. In fact, I feel that I have more control over my emotions than ever before. I still feel the rage though.Day 22 - Monday - I faithfully return to my doctor for another 5 minute session. I mention (and this is the first time since I started taking the Effexor that I actually analyzed it) that my depression has greatly subsided, but my anxiety and rage is still very much present. The good 'ol doc ups me to 150mg/day Effexor, and prescribes me Ativan. After this I am told to come back in one month. This both excites me (new drugs? Good times?) and confuses me because I don't really know what Ativan is. Regardless, I go fill my prescription and the pharmacist recommends trying the Ativan tonight before bed to see how it will effect me. I think the pharmacist was more concerned about me than my doctor was. I took an Ativan and it did not seem to do anything at all. Boring...Day 23 - Tuesday - Where did that carton go? I am beginning to realize that my consumption levels have raised significantly. I analyze my consumption and discover that my smoking has doubled (at least) and I want to smoke weed and drink every night. This is a new experience for me and I begin to worry. I don't contact my doctor because I am afraid he will cut me off the effexor or criticize me in some way. (remember, doctors are a NEW thing for me)Day 26 - Friday - Several packs (3?... 4?... I'm not even sure) and many beers and joints later... so begins and subsequently ends another weekend. Not as fun as last weekend though...Days 27-35- Consumption mania! I lose count of how much alcohol/tobacco/weed I consume, but in the back of my mind I think it must be at least triple my normal consumption by now. Odd...Day 36 - Monday - Back at work, but I can't stop smoking. I used to not smoke at all during the work day and now I am starting to count and consciously cut down my smoking. Because I am no longer feeling depressed I am able to care about my self enough to work on this new problem and it doesn't seem too bad.Day 37-42 - Still consuming. I carry on with my trend of drinking and smoking (weed and tobacco) as much as I can get my hands on. I must stop using the weekend as an excuse to over-indulge.Day 43 - Monday - I am still feeling the rage and the anxiety, although the anxiety is less and the depression is virtually gone. I haven't even pondered suicide in a very long time and I smile a LOT more now. The Ativan is still pretty much useless. What is it supposed to do?Day 44 - Tuesday - I smoke more weed (1/4 gram) but I consciously stop myself from drinking, and it is REALLY easy! I even cut my smoking down a bit.Day 45 - Wednesday - I do the same thing as yesterday... Smoke weed, same amount as yesterday and lie down to chill and watch some TV. I'm feeling really good and stoned... then it happens. My heart rate is quite high (maybe 120 or 130? I'm too high to count it properly) I continue to chill out and then one of my hands (I can't remember which one) clenches involuntarily! This totally freaks me out and raises my heart rate. My girlfriend is sleeping next to me in the bed, but I am too embarrassed to ask her for help. Next, my leg twitches which is normal for me, but this time it feels like a violent spasm more than just a twitch. I am worried a lot now, but thankfully still high. After a few minutes of this I start to calm down and ride out my weed high. Everything seems good until my hand clenches again and then I realize that my heart must be at least closing on 200bpm now. I am totally relaxed and comfortable and I can't figure out why my heart and muscles are acting this way. I immediately think of seizures. This raises my heart rate even more! In a last ditch attempt before calling 911 or dying or whatever, I take an Ativan. Thanks to my 'pay as you go, just as long as I get paid' doctor, I know the pills are supposed to do something with anxiety and I deduce that anxiety causes an accelerated heart rate. It's worth a shot. I dissolve one of those puppies under my tongue and lay back down. That did it, The twitching and clenching stopped immediately. My heart rate 'eventually' slowed and I was able to chill out and fall asleep.Day 47 - Today - I write a report and submit it.Alcohol : It can control me. To this day I think that alcohol is the number one dictating factor in my life as far as drugs go. I plan to quit or severely cut my alcohol consumption before mid-year.Tobacco : It doesn't provide any real benefits as far as I can tell. Alcohol gets me drunk and allows me to enjoy things more, Tobacco is just an addiction with no high. I smoke to stave off withdrawal and that's it. So basically smoking degenerates my health, costs a lot of money, and offers no high in return. Waste of time and money!Weed : So far so good. Except for some odd side effects as described earlier which I equate to combined use with Effexor, this drug is mostly benevolent. Effexor (XR) : Overall, it is an improvement for me personally. I am more open emotionally, the sky is still blue, and depression is becoming just a memory. The biggest downside for me was the sudden jump in consumption. I don't know if it was because I was feeling better and wanted to have more fun, or if it is simply a side effect of the drug. Having read a lot about blue lotus, we decided we had to at least try it before it got banned.  We purchased a quantity of dried petals online.PharmacokineticsI am 65kg, female, 27y, with a fast metabolismMy co-conspirator is 75kg, male, 28y, and similar.7g of blue lotus petals eachExtractionSince we didn't want to eat the quite large amount of plant material, and suspecting the active ingredient to be a water-soluble alkaloid, we placed the petals into microfibre infusion pouches- like fill-it-yourself teabags-  and dropped them into 400ml of tap water that was just off the boil.  We dunked and squashed the pouches with a stirrer and kept the temperature around 95 deg C with further low heat in order to keep the infusion going for twelve to fifteen minutes.We strained the infusion through muslin into a glass container.  We then used the muslin to squeeze as much fluid from the pouches as possible.The result was about 320ml of dark brown, slightly gritty solution.  We split it in two and placed it in glasses.  We drank it, my friend downed it in one hit and I sipped at it.  It was intensely bitter and made me feel nauseous-  though I do not believe this to be a pharma effect, rather that it just tastes nasty.This was T+0:00We then smoked a joint of cannabis and drank 120ml of 40% vodka each over about an hour.At T+0:15, I felt the muscles of my face relax and experienced a bump.At T+1:00 I started to experience serotonergic rushes. Colors became slightly more intense and the neon lights in the middle distance looked really sharp.At T+1:30, we smoked another joint.  We both felt very relaxed and the slight visual effects were a little more pronounced.At T+2:00, I was well under the influence and I tickled my friend.  He felt it kick off at that point.  We speculate that the blue lotus makes the brain more eager to produce serotonin, but does not itself stimulate production directly.  At T+2:30, we were both regularly feeling rushing, and my friend determined that the effect was closely modulated by alcohol-  it only took a couple of minutes after swallowing a little vodka for another rush to come in.  We both felt very friendly and extremely social.  My mind did not feel dulled by the various drugs, and I was very able to converse in a social way,  however I noticed that my higher reasoning was somewhat impaired.  We were hacking at my new Mac and we couldn't really work things out as well as we normally could.  Speech was also somewhat affected,  not slurring, but I suffered some nominative dyspraxia (I couldn't always think of the names for things, though I still knew what they were.)  I also stuttered more than I usually do.  My friend says he sometimes found himself saying the wrong words, though I don't remember this.  By this time we were listening to music and finding our moods were very closely influenced by the songs.  It was very pleasant.T+3:00, we were coming down a little, and it was very late at night, so we split a can of Red Bull and added a little more vodka (~100ml vodka each).  This contained about 75mg caffeine for each of us.  This turned out to be somewhat of a mistake,  I shortly felt quite overwhelmed.  Not nauseous, but very overstimulated.  Having my eyes open became disorienting and unpleasant, and I spent about the next 40 minutes curled in a fetal position with a duvet over me.  Fortunately, my friend is not easily freaked out, and as long as I kept telling him I felt okay, he was fine.  I felt quite happy and comfortable, as long as I kept my eyes closed.  I felt safe, and the high felt very clean and warm and friendly.  A few minutes later, my friend started to feel the same effect,  we speculate that the caffeine was too much at this point.T+4:00, this had passed, we were still coasting along.  We watched some videos and were having a great time.The effects gradually trickled away over about seven hours, and from this we estimate that the active ingredient in blue lotus has an elimination half life of about three to five hours.  We still notice some slight social effects and a mild high some eighteen hours later.  At no time did I feel that I was 'not myself', which markedly distinguishes this from a tryptophan effect,  they always make me feel quite 'un-self'.   My friend agrees,  this drug does not produce a feeling of 'otherness' like many drugs we have tried.At 8am, we were feeling a bit tired and hungry, so we went to get something to eat.  We ate sandwiches and drank fruit juice, which brought the effects down to a very mellow level and then I went home to bed.  I felt just fine riding the tram home on my own,  I didn't feel that I was looking at all crazy, or fear that people were looking at me.  I just felt very normal.Each time we added a little alcohol to the mix, we noticed a 'rush' come up,  these started quite gently, peaking at about T+3:00.  The difficulty of separating the effect of the blue lotus active ingredient concentration from the 'pushing' effect of the alcohol makes it difficult to draw a conclusion from this.This drug is very strongly synergistic with alcohol, nicotine and cannabis (at least) and there is a risk of an overstimulation episode with injudicious use.  We both noticed that every time it felt like the drug had 'stopped working', we could kick it off again very easily and quickly with alcohol,  I stopped drinking alcohol for several hours after my overstimulation episode and the drug's effects quickly diminished.  When I sipped a little more, somewhat later, it came back just the same as before the overstimulation,  it was very pleasant and controllable, without the dizzying height of MDMA.  Really, the combination of alcohol and blue lotus felt like a really mild version of MDMA, without the methamphetamine buzzing and without the hyperactivity.  I was happy to sit wherever I was and listen and talk to people.  I felt very connected to my friend, and I opened up my computer to chat to people who weren't physically present. At the turn of the new year I decided to try to make healthier choices in my life, like proper diet, exercise, all that stuff, that I had been neglecting for so long.  I have been having trouble with insomnia and mood, so I decided to try l-tryptophan as a remedy, as it is a precursor to 5-HT and many seem to consider that to be a major factor in sleep/mood (hence ssris and such).  In general, I really just wanted to do an experiment on myself, hoping that I might sleep better because of it.    L-tryptophan is nearly impossible to find in stores, probably because of the EMS outbreak.  I did find one website selling it, so I ordered one bottle with 60 500mg capsules of supposedly pure, peak-x free, l-tryptophan.  I took one to two capsules shortly before or after dinner every night for five nights and lived my life as I normally would.       The first two days I took one capsule at about 8 pm and basically just watched television for a bit then went to bed.  While it didn't help me get to sleep better, I did wake up feeling well rested, which doesn't happen often.  Other than that, I barely noticed any effect.     The third day happened to be superbowl sunday.  I went to a party and ate some snacks, mostly vegetables and bread, and drank a several shots of liquor.  Having experienced very weak effects from the l-tryptophan previously, I decided to take 2 capsules (1 g).  I swallowed to capsules with a beer and a shot.  About 1 hour later, I began to feel... well, akward I guess.  I was feeling unusually anxious (I get anxiety from time to time, but only stress related, never for no apparent reason).  It seemed pretty certain that this was due to the l-tryptophan.  There were also small changes in perception too.  I found myself staring at things like sometimes happens on hallucinogenics.  I would say that these effects felt very similar to the feelings one gets just before lsd or mushrooms kicks in.  No visual disturbances, just 'the calm before the storm.'  All in all, I found it somewhat uncomfortable and decided to go home and sleep it off.  I would figure that something used as a sleep aid would help me fall asleep, but the weird tripped-out feeling it gave me absolutely would not let sleep come.  Eventually I had to take 10mg cyclobenzaprine to help me sleep.  That was a weird but not all to unenjoyable.        The next day I took only one without drinking alcohol before bed.  I didn't feel the effects that I had the night before, but I had noticed slight changes in perception all day, and it persisted on throughout the night(weird dreams, too).  I can't put my finger on exactly HOW things seemed different, but they did.  I guess that’s what I get when I mess around with my own neurotransmitters.           Now we come to day five.  Perception is altered just as the previous day, though once again slightly noticeably.  My mood is slightly better on average (if at all; I’m not terribly depressed to begin with).  I feel more rested when I first wake, but other than that it has not helped me sleep better. After work I went home and ate some steamed broccoli, drank one beer, took one capsule of l-tryptophan, and went to a friends house to hang out.  While over there I had a few more beers (literally, maybe 3) and smoked a joint with several people.  This was all maybe 15 minutes prior to when the L-tryptophan started kicking in (BTW, it seems to take about an hour to an hour and a half for me to feel any effects once I take a capsule.)  Once it did, I damn near had an anxiety attack.  I felt very zoned out, tired and very alert at the same, and just plain shitty.  I kept breathing heavy and clenching my fists.  I almost chipped a tooth from the trauma.  At one point a saw a color shift, and very weak color patterns.  I couldn't really talk to anyone, and if could I would have said only, 'I feel like I'm losing my mind.'  I would definitely not call this a trip.  I would call this experience SHIT.  I am writing this the day after, and I still don't feel right.  You'll notice that the more  potent effects occured when alcohol or pot was involved.  I feel that L-tryptophan definitely has some weird synergy with drugs and alcohol.  I can see it effecting mdma and tryptamines, and maybe for the better, but my experiences have left me with no desire to take it anymore.  After taking this as described on the label (They say 1-3 capsules daily!  To hell with that) for 5 days, I would describe how I feel right now like this: Its like I was tripping for four days straight and this is the day after I've come down.  I have never met anyone who like that day-after-tripping, strung-out feeling.  I would only take it again to see if it would increase effects of a trip or roll, but that’s really not my kinda thing anymore. Let me start from the beginning. Warning this is going to be long...I've been a drug user for years, constantly teetering between depression and addiction. I've done everything, pot, ketamine, heroin, coke, absinthe, benzo, meth, amps, acid, 2c-b, ecstasy, ambien, lunesta, barbs you name it. I've even done rare happy potions like mescaline or talwin. I have not met a prescription I haven’t fucked harder then a 3 grand prostitute.I've been an alcoholic for the past two years, following a heavy heroin addiction. The months after my withdrawal from heroin saw me shooting cocaine, ketamine, popping handfuls of pills, supplementing with oxycontin, and generally doing anything and everything to stay high. I eventually ran out of money, and lost my drug contacts through either constant badgering or because they started to rip me off. I settled with alcohol as a legal and readily available choice for a high.I fell in love. Alcohol was legal, everyone did it, you could drink in public, you had no dealer, and a bottle of premium vodka is never over 35 bucks, that beats a daily coke/heroin habit by far.Fast forward 16 months. Other then the occasional blow and valium combo, or the occasional ecstasy tablet, I'd pretty much been drug free, just boozing my way to victory. Then, I broke my knee. Not just a break, I split it in half, tore a ligament, and to top it off, I was drunk when it happened. A normal person would have given up the hooch...I start binging on opiates and was up to a quart/750ml/fifth a day of hard liquor, 4-6 mg ov dilaudid iv'd, 10-50 mg of percocet orally and I was so fucked up I was little more then a pile of fat on an easy chair. The doc cut me off, and started to rely on just booze.After a few more months of daily drinking, I started to hallucinate if I didn’t get my fix. I started to black out, go on rampages, destroying property, beating the shit out of anyone in my way, and acting like a complete moron. My nerves were shot, I could barely see, and my acid reflux was so bad when I smelled vodka my stomach erupted like napalm.All was hopeless. I was damned to a life of addiction, once more. The fun days were gone, the friends were gone, and I was alone, in complete addiction. I decided to quit, but since I was DANGEROUSLY dependant on alcohol, I had to find something to get off the hooch. My dream was and still is to enjoy drunken binges without the fucking side effects...I saw a doctor, and started a detox. I left my state of Georgia for new jersey to visit my girlfriend, and detoxed for 17 days. My symptoms were all gone, and my friend Librium was helping me out.  However, when I stopped the detox, and my Librium went out, panic attacks became almost daily. Oh, and insomnia.My doc refused me sleep meds or panic atacks meds for fear of addiction. He wanted me to try 'breathing'. Docters aren't stupid, they know that most mild to moderate pain, anxiety and sleeplessness can be cured with placebo or mind-over matter. Former Drug abusers/users refuse mind over matter, knowing full well there are meds for it, and know if they can get them, they'll suffer or retreat to other drugs until they get them.So, I wasted no time in slamming a bottle of grey goose quicker then you can say 'fuck the 30 bucks'. And, 4 months later was in just as deep as before the detox.I fired my doctor. I remembered valium and remembered xanax from my days as an aspiring gonzo, and knew that either could be used for insomnia, alcohol withdrawal and anxiety. I also knew that they could be found online, if you know where to look, and trust me, I did.I had to pick one or the other, and could find little comparison on the two online. I knew xanax was stronger, so just went for it and ordered 100 1 mg pills.It worked for a few days but had no euphoria, so often I'd drink instead. And whenever I tried to cop a decent buzz, I'd either black out or be to fucked up and confused. It killed my panic attacks, and a few with a martinis made ambien feel like aspirin.However, it didn't supplement my drinking because drinking was more pleasurable, despite it's downsides. After my supply ran out, I resumed drinking even more.A month later, I decided I had to take a break from the hooch, so I decided to try valium  this time, and finally, it worked.I popped 40 mg, and was in dream land. I was relaxed, buzzed and happy. I had no desire for drugs or alcohol, slept like a baby and was finally cured for the night. It is euphoric unlike xanax, and much smoother. Not as strong, but that's a GOOD thing.I'm enjoying a sober morning. I can see, my reflux is gone and I feel relaxed and not worried because I have mother's little helper with me. Through an online pharmacy based in India, I purchased 100 pills of 10mg diazepam (Valium brand), which arrived about twenty days later.  The intention was for an initial foray into the effects of this pharmaceutical, and to keep the remainder as a remedy for relatively drastic psychedelic situations (i.e. as a tranquilizer).  This use of diazepam has been well documented. The afternoon the package arrived, I broke a pill into fourths and ate one of the pieces.  Feeling no effects after twenty minutes, and being slightly late for a class, I took the rest of the broken pill.  No effects were felt even hours later.  Feeling like a sucker for being ripped off by some fraudulant Indian scam operation, I consumed four of the '10mg' diazepam pills, along with two glasses of good Tuscan chianti. Sitting and watching a movie with friends, I became loose and somewhat numb, as though I had drunk more like six glasses of wine.  In other words, the diazepam had a sedative effect very much like alcohol.  The main difference was the way in which it affected my thought patterns -- slowing my thoughts and sort of mixing experiential memory with auditory or visual stimulation.  That is to say, it sometimes wasn't clear if I had misheard someone, or if I had spoken myself, or if nobody had said anything at all.  Regardless, it was difficult to speak, and I found myself forcing the sentences to become structured before they came out of my mouth.  I was very relaxed in both body and mind, like I said, as if I'd had a full bottle of wine or two.  Nobody seemed to notice my intoxication, and I enjoyed the experience, so over the following week, I consumed on average three or four 10mg diazepam pills per day, mainly for the calming 'fuzzy' effects.  Note, again: THIS WAS NOT MY ORIGINAL INTENTION.  As I said previously, I purchased the valium partly for experimentation, and partly as an 'out' for drasticly bad trips on psychedelics.  Diazepam is apparently an extremly addicting drug, and I (who pride myself on being very resistant to addiction of any kind) found myself finding every excuse possible to use it.  One morning I woke up feeling sort of lightheaded and queezy, and remembered drinking quite a bit the night before.  My roommates said, 'Well, he's alive -- that's a good sign,' when I came out of my room.  I said, 'What's that supposed to mean?'  And they recounted how I had been banging on their doors at 5 A.M. asking for 'my CD back... that CD I lent you'.  One of my roommates groggily came out of his room and told me to get the fuck to bed.  He reported that my legs seemed to be giving out and I had 'trouble finding the direction of the hallway' versus the walls.  Halfway to my room I collapsed and nearly smashed my head through the television.  I eventually made it to bed.  The following morning, when they told me what had happened, I suspected valium had something to do with it.  I checked the container, and sure enough I had taken 10 pills, or 100mg of valium, on top of about 12oz. of vodka (measured as taken from a previously unopened bottle), and four sleeping pills (diphenhydramine HCl, about 100mg total).  Now, this was probably over the course of about eight hours, but taken at once, it is probably a deadly combination.  There was vomit in my bed, on my pillow and on my clothing. An even more bizarre part of my report comes from the end stages of my diazepam use, when I decided to take a full jar of Dramamine tablets (12 in all).  These are motion sickness pills, over the counter.  I'd heard they induced hallucinations, and I thought, 'shit, worst case scenario, I'll pop a couple of valiums and settle down'.  Wrong.    'Popping a couple of valiums' wouldn't have done any good, as I was already above the threshold of any significant physiological effect (at this point I had consumed probably 70 pills, 10mg each of diazepam, over the course of a week and a half).I took 12 Dramamine tablets and a couple of sleeping pills just for kicks around 10 PM.  About 11 PM, I heard somebody clanking dishes in the kitchen, so I thought I'd go have a chat.  When I got there not only was there nobody in the kitchen, the lights were out, and all of my roommates were sound asleep.  I thought that was odd, but then heard music coming from outside in our backyard, so I looked out the window -- nobody out there.  Opened the door, the music got louder, but now it was coming from BEHIND me.  I closed the sliding glass door and turned around, and my roommate was standing next to the sink pouring a glass of water.  He was wearing his work-out clothes and running shoes, which was odd considering he's usually in bed by 10PM.  He took a swig of water and said, 'What's up man, you pissing outside or something?'  I didn't respond, but sat down at the kitchen table and asked him, 'What are you doing up?'  He smiled this sort of 'I know something you don't' smile, took another drink and asked me why I was 'doing this' to myself.  I looked down to grab a spoonful of cereal I had been eating, wondering what he meant.  When I looked back up to answer, he was gone.  I don't mean that he had turned and walked away -- I mean he was not there at all.  At that point I realized I was hallucinating and it scared me.Hallucinating on dimenhydrinate is NOT like hallucinating on mushrooms or LSD.  Not at all.  My perception of reality can seem perfect, flawless, seemless in every way, and yet it's not happening at all.  I remember one time pondering a rock outcrop on the beach at Santa Cruz while on mushrooms, thinking about how nature seems to form things in curious ways that become even more beautiful when I understand them.  The rock outcrop suddenly seemed to morph into what looked like Lydia from the movie 'Beetlejuice', and I was instantly laughing hysterically at my hallucination.  This sort of shit could never happen on dimenhydrinate.  Lydia would be standing there talking to me, until I looked away and she vanished.Getting back to the story, I realized I was hallucinating and I thought I could hear my other roommates talking in the other room (about me, I presumed) as sounds and shapes fluttered through my cerebrum.  I went to put my cereal bowl in the dishwasher, and there was no cereal bowl.  Distraught and utterly confused, I stumbled to my room to sit and try to calm down.  I had already taken enough valium, so that was out of the question.  Just when I thought I was going to lose it and go running down the street, I noticed my third roommate was lying on my futon reading a magazine.  'What's up dude?' he said, putting the magazine on down on his chest and sort of turning toward me.  I couldn't quite formulate a sentence, but I said something like, 'I think I should stop taking this stuff.'  He replied with some comment that had nothing to do with my drug use -- about the Yankees and Alex Rodriguez or some such thing.  We talked about baseball for what seemed like ten or fifteen minutes (I was completely convinced he was really there), and then I asked him a question, looked up for a response, and there was nobody there.  I took two sleeping pills, laid back on my bed and hallucinated myself to sleep.The scary thing about this stuff (dimenhydrinate) is that the hallucinations for all intents and purposes are completely real.  There is NO, and I repeat, NO DIFFERENCE between reality and what my brain manifests in response to this substance. Abusing motion sickness pills is like temporary schizophrenia.  At some points I even had attacks of paranoia.The visual and auditory hallucinations went on for about another day, and included conversations with people who don't even live in the same state.Also, nitrous oxide (which has been known to produce some of these effects on its own) amplified the hallucinations by a factor of 10.  I thought they were gone (it had been two days since), popped a couple of whippits, and suddenly my room was full of kids I hadn't seen since high school.  I went to ask one of them a question, and they all just got up and walked out the door.It has been three days now since I used either diezapam or dimenhydrinate, and I feel no lingering effects (thank god).  My memory might be slightly cloudier, but it's hard to say, and I feel better each passing hour.  Though I am a bit jittery from the diazepam withdrawl.Well, I had a fantastic body high, and really didn't give a shit about anything besides my fading grip on reality.  The downside is that being so clumsy, I dropped glasses, bowls, plates, flower pots, you name it, in the process, all of which I need to replace; and I now bear the guilt of ruining my roommate's hand painted soup bowl sent from her grandmother in Japan.Thankfully, one of my roommates confronted me a few days later and said he was concerned about me, and my recent drug abuse.  It made me feel really good to know that he had noticed my downward spiral and that he cared about me.  Needless to say, I'm not doing that kind of crap anymore.  I needed help.  My counseling appointment is for tomorrow.  I'm not quitting drugs or alcohol, I just want to figure my shit out enough so I don't abuse them. Last night, new years eve 2004, was the second time in only a period of a few months that I almost died several different ways in a drunken stupor.  This only happens when I hang out with my friend 'S', quite possibly the worst drinking buddy ever; but what he did for me last night is just amazing.  My plan the whole day was to just go hang out with S and his girlfriend, get a little drunk, and go home at about ten to my family because my mom had planned a dinner thing and I wanted to be with them at midnight of course.  As it turned out I got home at around 4 in the morning after being discharged from the hospital, and was probably in a coma at midnight.  Many a thing happened last night, a great deal of which I don't remember at all and has been told to me for the purpose of this report, please take to heart this terrible night and be careful when drinking; I'm damn lucky I made it through all of this as well as I did.  I am pretty much convinved I have a drinking angel or something that watches out for me when I get myself drunk, and I am NOT in any way a religious person.  Now on to the story...I think I met up with S and his girl at about 4-5 pm; his mom bought him a half gallon of vodka, and we were making the rounds to rite-aid and such looking for a 2 liter or something to mix it in.  We stopped at the house of a friend of S's, I'll call D, to get some pot, real good shit.  We chilled at D's for a bit, had a round of shots and smoked a few bowls and a blunt; he's a big poker enthusiast, and we all talked quite a bit about the strategy and luck components of games like that for a while, the eve was off to a great start.  We left D's after about an hour and were in search of a place to go drink, S's mom technically doesn't like people drinking in her place (it's a guarded apartment building with some 'unsavor characters' living in it and it's an issue when people stumble out the door all shitfaced) but there was no other place, so we went.  'Mom' (as his mom is known to all) wasn't too pleased as she'd planned a quit and early evening to herself and didn't like the idea of us being there too long.  We mixed our first 2 liter there, and wanted to go spend some subway stamps and get some subs but the bastards closed early, can't help but to think that had I had a little more food in my stomach I might not have gotten as bad as I did; as it was I had a small piece of pie and an english muffin at mom's place and that was it (of course I had been planning on going home and feasting later, so I wasn't looking to be full and thought I'd just get an extra buzz, BIG MISTAKE!)  We all took healthy guzzles from our drink; vodka and that new berry 7-Up are a great combo, barely even notice the booze, and decided to go visit S's aunt 'P'.  Mom hadn't seen P for a good bit, and wanted to come along so we all mobbed out towards her place; on the way mom bought S and I each one of those Sparks things (the malt beverage energy drink), which are damn good.  By the time we got to P's, S and his girl had been drinking hard, but I had only had a few chugs and was hardly feeling anything.  P was one of the best people I'd ever met, I love that woman in every way but a romantic one, it's hard to describe but she was just very 'cosmic' and intelligent in a more spiritual way.  The last thing I remember is S's girl filling up the next 2 liter, and S and I had just smoked a bowl that I was preparing to match him on.  I asked him the time and he said it was about 9:45; I was prepared to smoke another bowl, have a another drink for the road and head home, but instead came to 5 or so hours later in the ER.  From this point foward my memory ends, and this is only as has been retold to me.  I must have hit a blackout very shortly after asking the time, for me blackouts are just periods that I never remember and in which I say and do very stupid things.  I must stress how little I drank in comparison to S and his girl, and I was only starting to slur my words a slight bit and had a bit of difficulty manuevering around tight spaces and such; basically the starting point of intoxication as I last remember.  After the bowl that I matched S, P took out her stash and I matched her several bowls (I almost smoked my whole $60 bag with her!) meanwhile she kept telling me to put mine away; I guess I just kept telling her that I loved and respected her so much I would do anything for her, or something along those lines.  At one point I tried to put it away, but instead spilled it all over my shirt, then when S got down to pick it up and was putting it back in the bag in front of my face I was accusing him of ripping me off.  The alcohol I had consumed was slowly starting to hit, but this is what threw me over the edge.  P had trainwreck, which is known to veterans to be very powerful 'creeper' weed (don't feel anything at first then it hits HARD like 5 minutes later when I smoke it, very dangerous in large amounts especially with alcohol) and we smoked bowl after bowl after bowl etc.  S said later P was so blazed she just kept loading.  This is how I know I was in a blackout though, it was like 11:00 and I was sitting around smoking, when I had planned to leave an hour before; I also don't like to smoke more than 2-3 bowls at a time becuase I never feel much higher and instead I just get a headache from all the smoke.  At about 11:30, we got up to go, the problem was I couldn't stand, or move much at all.  I guess I got up and crashed into a bunch of furniture (didn't break anything thankfully) and S told me I was staying there for the night.  He tried to put a blanket on me but I wouldn't let him and was trying to fight him, eventually I puked all over the blanket and on myself.  I don't know why, but after that the 4 of us left; I think S was going to put me on the train and ride with me until my stop (which is very far from where the three of them live, they really were looking out for me) but we never made it.  I have very hazy memories of looking up and seeing that I was being dragged along by the arms and I just kept falling, my legs wouldn't move or cooridinate at all.  S likened it to one of those dolls where one pulls the string and it does jumping jack motions.  I guess I repeatedly kicked him in the knee on accident, which isn't cool because he has bad arthritis problems in that knee.  At some point I just charged towards some random house; the door was at the bottom of a stair well, and I just ran down and smacked straight into the door, fell backwards, and hit my head several times on the concrete.  After that I was unconscious and completely unrousable, which has happened to me before, I think they're like mini comas or something because I don't respond to ANYTHING.  Mom was worried I had a concussion, and S's knee was killing him, so they wanted to go to a hospital.  S called my sister from my cell and told her I was passed out in a stair well, when she told my mom and dad that they all piled in the car and raced out towards the other side of town (I guess something about what S said to my sister was enough to scare her) counting down the minutes until new year in the car.  I hear they pulled up and I couldn't move and was still unconscious, so all of them had to drag me and stuff me in the car.  S, his girl and his mom all told me later they were damn sore after dragging my ass around like that.  By this point I was soaking wet from falling in puddles and pissing my pants which I did several times, plus probably reeked of puke.  They took me right in to the ER once I was falling into walls and such in the waiting room.  I must have been awake at that point but still in a blackout; I think I passed out again later because I was unconscious for a lot of the proceedings in the ER, like the catheter insertion for example, and I don't think unconsciousness could ever be more merciful.  It took me a really long time to figure out I was in a hospital and that my family was there, though I was awake for a good few hours of it.  They gave me a cat scan and I was talking a lot to the guy doing it, I babbled to everyone and ceaselessly asked what time it was.  The only part about it I remember however was being told once that it was almost 4 am, and that's when I looked around and saw my mom, dad and sister and became a little more aware of the fact that I was in the hospital and such.  I was crying a lot and thanking everyone for 'saving my life', I also asked the nurses and doctors some very peculiar questions, people said that I wasn't slurring too bad actually.  For example, I asked the doctor if methamphetamine lowers you tolerance to alcohol, and then adamantly swore I had only tried meth once (which is true), they must of thought I was the most dipshit tweaker-drunk.  The doctor bitched me out several times about how drunk I was (my blood-alcohol level was .352!), she was saying the fact that I wasn't in a coma with that much booze in me meant that I was an alcoholic and had a dangers dependancy; which doesn't make much sense in my little world, seems to me that just indicates I've got a high tolerance (which I do, very high and with many substances, 1000 miligrams of vicodin to me is a barely noticeable buzz).  Meanwhile, and speaking of vicodin, my friend S got a prescription and 6 pills for the road; this is a guy who drinks himself into oblivion every night and is the most insane drunk I've ever known or would want to know, and yet I get the lecture?  If my BAC was .352, he must have been like .6; he drank SO much more than I did, and him, his mom, his girl, and anyone else that was with me that night continued to say how little I had actually drank (especially in comparison to S).  My family (sister aside) had never met S, I wish I could have introduced them, but instead they met under these circumstances; my mom went and thanked them and said that S was hugging her and shit, he was wasted but held it much better than me in more ways than one.  S's girl hit on my sister (she's bi and thinks my sister is hot, I've known this for a while) and told her she wanted to have a 3-way with her and S; then S came to see how I was doing, I kissed him and said that it wasn't romantic, I kept telling people I loved them and wanted to kiss them in a non romantic way, so I guess I finally did.  What did I learn from this?  A lot.  I'm not drinking anymore because I do like the buzz A LOT (I'm what you'd call a lush, a borderline/low level alcoholic) and am getting tired of spending so much money on it and having to drink every night etc.  I really hate getting DRUNK, to the point where you can't even stand and such, a little drunk is great to me but I absolutely detest when it goes over the line.  Other shitty things happened too: I lost $30 out of my wallet somehow which I know I'll never see again, I almost smoked all my weed, my dick hurts like hell and pissing is just agony, the hospital always sucks and when the staff treats you like shit (they were pretty surly) it makes it much worse plus whatever asshole put my IV in did a hell of a job because my arm is so full of trackmarks I look like a smack junkie, and I acted like an idiot in front of some people I really love and respect; S, his girl, his mom, P and lots of others.  It's just a terribly humiliating thing to be that way and have to get dragged to a hospital because you can't even stand; I missed new years completely and made many other people miss it too, not cool.  I also really found out something about S, I always trusted the guy and liked him as a friend, but he stayed with me and dealt with me like that, and in an area of town where I would have surely been beaten and robbed if he'd left me or tried to let me take care of myself; then come the morning the drunk bus would've found me and taken me to detox, which is worse than the hospital, if I hadn't choked on vomit or something and was still alive that is.  If it weren't for S, this already very shitty event would have been much worse (for me at least) and I think of him like a brother at this point, which he told me last night is a mutual feeling.  I'm indebted to all three of them for taking care of me like that, I couldn't ever repay that but certainly would return the favor if it came up.  The biggest thing I learned out of all of this is that I just should never even start the drinking, at least the heavy drinking, until I get to a place you want to stay; avoid at all costs the notion of trying to get home or wherever I want to be while completely shitfaced. Here I am, 30 years old and completely addicted again.  I fell off the wag this last New Years after 2 years away from the sauce and now it's April.  Most of the population has no problem with this substance but for those out there now who are thinking of getting a Sixer on a Tuesday night after classes we have to watch out.Now I didn't get addicted to alcohol until I was 24-25, and in fact I didn't even drink until I was 22.  I did smoke lots of canabis and I knew how to grow mushrooms (out of my college appartment no less.. hah!) so I did a lot of trading with the nugs and MDMA folks.  I went to keggers and the like but my love was the weed. Wake'n'bake go to class, head back to the dorms, get blunted with friends go do my 4 hour shift at the Library.. etc.  Well around the same time that I had built up a hard tolerance to THC (stoned for under 5-10minutes) I ended up getting the paranoia.  Every time I would smoke I would panic so I stopped.  As soon as I stopped THC I started to drink daily.  3 beers at night, just to cool out and play some Mario.  A year later I was up to a 12 pack a night.  And a year after that I was up to a 24-30 beers a day.The last quarter before graduation I would slam 6 beers first thing in the morning.  Have 3 for lunch and after classes I was off.  Now you might think, '6 beers in the morning? he must have been stumbling around mumbling.'  If I didn't have the alcohol I couldn't function.  It kept me from throwing up, and killed all hangover (which is why many alcoholics start becoming hard core, that morning maintenance.)Hang on there is actually a trip report in here.  But I feel that the full story might help some.Anyway, I found I was really REALLY good at hiding my problems and I became THE functional drunk.  I had a career, and I made it work.  For about 2 years at which point I had mixed some GHB and messed it up and passed completely out at work ending up in the hospital.  Long story short, they gave me a breathalizer and saw I had been drinking (actually I hadn't in like 9 hours, but I drink like a fish.) And my performance had been pretty crappy for the last 5 months. AND the 'Ride the WEB' was now the get the f--- out fast.So I go to rehab, recover, withdrawal was shaky/sweaty nothing too bad.  So I clean up for 2 years, go to AA and other such 'stay clean' groups for a month or two and then stop.  I was using crutches anyway, N20, dextromethorphan.So here I was at a New Years 2k3 Party in Dallas with some old old friends from High School.  I had a drink, thought it wouldn't be a big deal, forgot all about what it was once like and Alcohol is like that.  I turn my back on it I'm screwed.  So I didn't drink for several days after but my mind has two sides when I've been addicted and one of them always says, 'Ah man! you can handle this! go to that bar Friday it's been days sense your last drink.  We will make it a weekend thing.'  I tell you what that voice is always wrong.So Here it is 4 months later...  I've been drinking no beer for over a month I have moved to $5.99 1L 80proof (hangover special) Vodka.  One month of drinking hard alcohol, something I never did in the past.  And it's just sad, because now my body is just a chemical dump.Gone are the days when I did Mushrooms twice a year to search my soul and my purpose in life.  I had given it up for nothing but to forget about all I had been taught.  So now I have to stop cold.  I can't drink that much alcohol and live past 40-50 without a new heart and liver.  So I get home from work, and go right to bed.I wake up at 10:00pm in full withdrawal- shakes, sweats, hard core anxiety, restlessness, and around 12:00am vomiting.  this goes on until 3:00am at which point I'm presented with the most horrible hallucinogenic experience of my life.Delirium Tremens - hard core alcohol withdrawal. I first noticed that I was in trouble when I heard people calling out to me and I still had enough wits to know that it couldn't be real.  I started to see things.. horrible things like I went to the restroom to urinate and all the fingers on my left hand fell to the counter and moved around.  They didn't break off with blood and gore but all bound in pink skin as if they were always seperate from me.  At the time this seemed completely real, not like a Psilocybin trip when I know that I'm messed up I mean I was in a complete delirium state and this all seemed perfectly normal and it wasn't a dream state I was quite aware that these things were happening to me, and I retained memory of the entire night.  While in the bed shaking people I knew came and tormented me, poking me and some talking gibberish that passed from sound to visual patterns in the corners of my vision - white lines and anxiety/terror were also created through my hearing. Or it could have been the anxiety and feelings of terror creating the sounds. I had a lengthy debate with my clock radio about how the sky was made of pudding and he explained how to build the spoon that could reach it (it didn't move around it just suddenly became a sentient entity.) I heard angry people slamming doors where there were no doors. Around 8:00am I suddenly realized, absolutely covered in a cold sweat, that I had been delirious and that things were pretty f'ning far from all right. I called a friend and hit my family doctor who gave me a Librium (Anti-Anxiety, Sedative) to take care of the 'heebby-Jeebbys' Then gave me a prescription for a fun fun 5 day home detox and now I write this. If you know your going to detox do yourself a favor and see your doctor BEFORE you start, you don't want what I went through last night.Nothing has scared me more than thinking something was completely real and that split second I realized it wasn't it hit me like a ton of bricks.  My reality is on a paper thin line of chemical reactions. I had my first drink when I was 14 years old at a family thanksgiving gathering. The homemade cherry heering was enough to give my quite the euphoric feeling and a strong alcohol buzz. I enjoyed the feeling soo much, in fact, that even at such a young age it became a fairly large part of my life. At about age 16 stealing a couple shots at night from my parents wasn't enough, so I found co-workers and friends who were willing to buy me bottles for a little cost. I never figured it was any problem, I mean seriously, who thinks getting a little drunk at night is any reason to fret. Time went by, and my alcohol use became more and more. It wasnt actually a daily habit yet, but by the time I moved into my college dorm I could easily out-drink anyone who challenged me. I never had any problems with hangovers, but I blacked out on a regular basis. I only puked once when I had 1L of 101wild turkey, 6 shots malibu coconut rum, 5 shots McCormicks vodka, and 1 12 oz corona. Needless to say I had taken the hobby to a dangerous level and quite frequently. I found parties and other social activities irritable and boring without it.Soon when fridays came along, alcohol was all I could think about. Weekends just became a blur as I went through $40-$50 in two days. With engineering courses becoming a challenge and stress elevating constantly, instead of doing something positive I picked up drinking on weekdays. Sometimes I would even start in the early afternoon right after class let out. Soon, wakeng up and finishing a bottle from the previous night was normal. I became much less social, and even had friends express concern for my personal safety. All this did was piss me off. For a while I truly believed they thought they were better than me; they considered me just some fat party animal with no future. I knew alcohol was a problem, I thought about it all the time. Sobriety was just the annoying time between my last and next drink. I still did not do anything about it, even after a close friend said I was becomeing scary and violent when I drank (with an abusive father I swore I would quit cold turkey if I ever emulated him). This put me in a mood ever so foul especially after failing an impossible physics exam not more than an hour previous. Of course I turned to my old friend, a 1.75 liter bottle of admiral nelsons that I had bought to take care of me through my physics torment. The seal wasnt even cracked, and so I had the chilled bottle all to my self.Some person is trying to make me fill out some information, but I cant understand what she is saying (the task of filling out the form could better be achieved my a monkey).  I look around through really blurry eyes trying to figure out where I am and what is going on. I notice two police officers sitting at the foot of my bed watching me, and dried blood all over my hands and arms. I frantically try to figure out what is happening, but I cant remember anything at all and no one will tell me anything. The clock looks like it says about 4.15 am. It finally dawns on me that I am in an E.R. room in the hospital, and I am alone (no friends or family). The next two hours I spent talking to a woman in a business suit, who refused to tell me who she was. Another nurse walked in at about 6 am and asked if I wanted to speak with my mother, the one person closest to me my whole life, constantly guiding and helping me. I shook to restrain the tears of just the thought of speaking to her. How could I have let myself drop so low. How could I screw up so bad.It was later when I was driven off to detox that I found out I had blown a .36 approximately four hours after I had stopped drinking. Alcohol has been known to be lethal at .3 and above. They had rushed me to the hospital after a few friends had found me screaming 'I want to die' and 'just kill me.' I had a self inflicted lump on my head that had swollen to an unimaginable size. The woman I had talked to for hours was a therapist determining if I was a further threat to my own well being. I heard later that my friends held me down for over a half hour while the ambulance and police showed up. I will not go into the details of detox, but my dear sweet mother dropped everything and drove out to see if I was okay. I was still somewhat drunk when she showed up at about noon, and facing her was one of the most difficult things I have ever done. I cannot explain to you how painful it was; I was unable to look her in the eyes the whole time. The friends who held me down picked me up from detox that night.It has been 4 months ten days, 1 court meeting, 3 manditory therapist meetings, $200 dollars, and many painful conversations with family and friends, but I am free of the dreaded drink. Infact the mere thought puts the fear of god in me. I know it can be used well recreationally, but it got the best of me.  [Erowid Note: Combining MAOIs with other psychoactive drugs carries serious medical risks and can result in extremely unpleasant side effects, overheating, nausea, confusion, heart problems, and even death. Please see Erowid's MAOI Vault] LAST SLEEP:Last sleep was 6:15am to 12:15pm.  Prior was 2:30am to 8:30am.  Less than normal, but I've been sleeping solid, so it works as well as my normal 8+ hours.LAST FOOD:6pm, 2 eggrolls, 1.5 cups shrimp and snow peas in garlic sauce, 1/2 cup rice.DRUGS:Sleep Deprivation, Crumbly yellow-star 75-100mg MDMA, plus Syrian Rue, plus Amaretto.I have another report pending regarding sleep deprivation filed under MDE/MDMA/MA.  Sleep deprivation is the #1 psychedelic.  Hallucinations, mood alterations, paranoia, etc.  Learn to tap into this if you're a night tripper but a day worker.REASONING:The Yellow Stars ended up being much weaker than we'd all planned on, but we paid as much as if they'd been 250mg tablets.  In order to attempt to extend their lifespan and increace their efficacy, I decided to test what is GENERALLY considered dangerous -- combine MDMA with a known MAOI.DANGERS:General precations here are possibility for acute hypertensive shock, or seratonin syndrome -- both of which are potentially fatal; however, most reports I've seen have been people doing full or crazy doses in addition to having MAOI.  Overall, there's a surprising lack of reports.Always test on the weak side before trying full dosage of anything, and research extensively for interactions.  Be prepared.  Be safe (contextually anyway).PROCEDURE:Based on my experience boosting with Syrian rue, but starting small for 'safety' I used   About 1 tsp coconut flavored 75% ethanol (rum/everclear run through coconut shreds)   1/12th TSP 4x harmala extract (~0.4g)   1/12th weak tablet MDMA (5-10mg NET)Amaretto sour covers the flavor of dissolved Syrian Rue fairly well.I mixed the above thoroughly, then added:  1.5 ounces Amaretto  ice  sweet and sour mix (to top off an 8 oz glass)3:36am, started drinking cocktail3:58am, finished drinking cocktail4:08am, first waves and synaesthesia with music4:44am, not enough going on.Eating another crumb, a little larger than last time.I'll call it 1/11th? (which brings it to 23/132).5:40am, I realized that much of the ho hum is caused by sitting motionless on computer.  I was on a mission.  It's the true, underlying mission of all geeks' struggles with technology.Tingles and general goodness are there.  It's about 10% stronger than if I'd eaten the whole 75-100mg tablet by itself (not intense by any means, but definitely there).Decided to take advantage of my geek induced creative google searches set on recursive slide show.  It ws quick and massively intense.  It would have been awesome with my mate had she been in town.Also, I can tell the peak has already come and gone, in more than one way.  I decided to try boosting, which usually doesn't work well for MDMA, but oh well.  It's a weekend.Created new cocktail with the rest of a third of the pill, plus 1/8th tsp 4x Syrian Rue extract.  No pre-mix with stronger ethanol, and I added ice FIRST, so some clumps of rue didn't dissolve.5:53am, done with new cocktail and a second rinse with water to get the rest of the sediment.6:18am, kinda sloshy in the stomach.Lots of sleep deprivation high.  Tracers, imagined hallucinations.(I don't have real hallucinations except on severe sleep deprivation).I'm very tired.6:28am, still kinda sloshy.  More waves washing over.  Smaller and more rapid than usual MDMA.6:36am, new peak.  Not great.  My laptop has an aura, and my visual field has density fluctuations, if that makes sense.  I'm sweating, but I check and it's 84 degrees, 62% humidity.Sirius Area 63 overly repetitive track selection becomes less of a problem.I'm battling over whether to go to sleep; see where I can take the tail end of this trip; take the rest of the crumbly yellow star; or try to boost the trip to binge/bender status with MDE/MA pill (and call in sick the next 3 days for sleep deprivation induced bronchitis).I've been neurotically rewriting this report for clarity and flow.I really want to get up and dance. This is where I omit an entire section on my mental exploration of personal defects.  Suffice it to say that serious introspection was accurate, effortless, and rapid.  MAOI + MDMA both attributed to this effect; however, I spend 20% of my waking time in self induced trance.  Your results may vary.7:03am It bosted up pretty well considering the situation.  I feel nice.  Very functional, especially for being tired.7:15a Note, food does not in any way sound appetizing.If looking for the trip, it seems very mild.  If I sink into the trip, it's very much there.  Very gentle, like a calm ocean.  There is much power there in the vast quantity of water, but it is at peace with me and I with it.Nothing spectacular anticipated for the duration of the trip.  Whether I boost again or not won't affect the overall result of this report.SUMMARY:So this is working -- something, obviously.  It's not normal, but it's not abnormal.  The AC feels good, and introspection works pretty well.Next time, to get a bigger peak, and a more pronounced effect, I will have:   1/6th to 1/3rd pill of weak X   plus 1/12th to 1/6th TSP 4x Rue ExtractI think for MDMA, rue is a 4-6x multiplier, wheras for 5-MeO-MiPT it was about a 10x-12x multiplier.  I'm probably off on the MDMA part since I boosted.  It may still be 10x-12x if taken all at once.  I think 0.40g/kg MDMA would be MAX with Rue. I think anything more would be just WAY too much, and definitely toying with potentially dangerous consequences.The Rue seems to be 4h full cycle, so it's a shorter trip.  The rue boosts fine repeatedly though, so the same MDMA dose could be extended with more rue.  Rue is cheap and easy to acquire since it's used in red dyes and incense. This story begins with a trip back to my home town with a large tupperware box full of Psilocybe Cubensis that I had been growing over the past few weeks. I had tested the shrooms out in small quantities, but not yet had the chance to try a larger dose for want of a suitable venue. This weekend, I was going back to visit some friends I hadn’t seen in a while. Also I had far too many dried mushrooms to have lying around the house and was hoping my pals would help me get rid of them before I came back home.        I arrived about 5:00pm and met my friends in my old local – a student bar type place. The plan was to go and watch our friends’ band play their gig in a nearby  social(!) and then on to D’s house to trip out tits off. He had mentioned that his granddad was staying for a while, but D’s family is deaf, so we never have to worry about noise. Thought nothing of it. . .We happened to bump into a man selling some good coke – so we bought a gram of it, and three of us ended up snorting it all off the toilet cistern at the social when we arrived. By the time the band came on we were getting quite rowdy – and had also a significant amount to drink.  Not sure the regulars or the staff at the club were too happy with us. Either way, we must have been very wasted when the gig ended as D and myself were refused entry to the university bar everyone else had moved on to. Also, I miraculously remember lunging at D for some unknown reason, missing completely and charging headlong into a concrete bollard, knocking myself almost out cold. The lump is still there. So D and I, and two other mates began to stumble to another club but by now it was 1:15am and nobody was going to let us in anywhere. D was standing around frantically phoning people to find some weed and eventually the others got bored and left us there. We decided that although we had no weed we had plenty of Cubensis so it didn’t matter. At about 2:00 am we arrived somehow and sat in the kitchen.  D put the kettle on and I dealt out the shrooms. I’m not sure just how many we ate, but  I know we didn’t finish the ones we decided to eat, which was probably a good thing. (later, I would see  them crawling like worms over the kitchen table) The coke and alcohol must have affected our judgement, but I’m guessing we ate about 8 or 9 good sized shrooms each. D put his in a marmite sandwich, which must have helped the taste a lot as he won’t even eat normal mushrooms, yet he kept was saying how good the sandwich was. This man doesn’t even like the taste of mint toothpaste, so Marmite could be a good method of masking the taste for those fussier eaters out there.  Or he might have been really drunk. Whatever.       Probably due to the booze (we’d had about 8 pints each and a shot or two), the effects hit me very suddenly, and heavily. There was no gradual build-up – no subtle tingles or trails warning us to get comfy. One minute I am reading the paper and D is on the phone to G, who had just got back home from the Uni Bar.  Seconds later, I find myself laughing hysterically at everything I hear him say. Then a huge heiroglyphic cat shape on D’s kitchen wall  appears and  suddenly I am aware of all this intense movement and noise going on in the kitchen. Everything I look at is moving. And I can hear all sorts of indescribable sounds. The tiles  on the wall are multiplying and moving crazily fast. Any kind of repetitive pattern – wood grain, wallpaper, the worktops, the skirting boards, even the hairs on my arm, begins to come alive. I go over to D and say something like “I think it’s starting..what the fuck what the fuck man” – D at this point seems fairly coherent and not quite sure what I’m talking about. He’s looking at me with some concern. He hasn’t properly tripped before and he hasn’t seen me tripping either. I say “wait for it man, this is intense” and collapse on the floor in fits of uncontrollable laughter. I grab the phone to talk to G but instantly forget that he’s on the line because D’s computer is moving steadily up the wall and changing colour. The plain yellow walls are suddenly a mess of fractal geometry, billowing in and out like tent canvas. The floorboards are moving around like a fun-house.  I try to tell G to get a cab over so he can see this but have completely lost all power of speech and end up saying each syllable about a million times. “Wha…wha… man man you you you man you you have to to to to see….to see…..OH MY GOD!”         D takes the phone back  and tries to chat to G some more while I  crawl around in the kitchen screaming  “LOOK AT THE FLOOR, MAN LOOK AT THE FUCKING FLOOR!”. The patterns on all the floor tiles are crawling around. I reach down to touch it thinking that because it’s just the drugs, it will stop moving once my finger makes contact.  But it doesn’t. It travels up my arm just like that scene in Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Until now I thought that was exaggerated in the film, but seeing it happen is something else. And all I can say is “I thought I….I thought I knew….I….I thought…but THIS….This is…OH MY GOD!” I’ve had trips before but usually been able to control them somewhat. This one is taking me over. The semi-realisation of just how wasted I am kicks in for a minute, and then I’ve completely forgotten again. D is peering over my shoulder at the floor and doesn’t appear to see anything yet. I get a strange feeling on my tongue, as if I have nylon threads,  like fishing line, in my mouth. I’ve never had a tactile hallucination before, but this doesn’t bother me much. This feeling comes and goes throughout the night but  it seems to be the only thing I am 100% certain is not real. And yet in retrospect I may well have had cat-hair in my mouth  from crawling around on the floor. I will never know.        I realise I need to go to the toilet – and am surprised how easy it is to walk up the stairs. I even manage to piss in the toilet without sprinkling.  I look at myself in the mirror – all my features are outlined  by this zebra-striped string that is constantly moving around my face. I also have hair like Paul from Tekken. When I come back downstairs, D is talking on the phone. I ask him if it’s still G. He says yes, but I get the idea that he’s already hung up and D just thinks he’s there. I take the phone from him – he is starting to look very entranced by the computer.  G is still there. However, the fact that neither of us were sure if D was talking to nobody for five minutes makes us both crease up laughing again and we soon forget that he’s still on the line and go back into the kitchen. D. is now as fucked up as I am. His face begins to take on some very gnomish qualities, (The wooly hat he is wearing helps this) and looks like he’s been painted into reality by Van Gogh. He is also looking at everything and shouting “ OH MY GOD” a lot. .Neither of us can really speak. We babble at each other  for hours, sounding like Teletubbies. We are trying to describe what’s going on, but this proves to difficult. The conversation goes something like:“What the…the…the….fuck”“You…you…you…man….you too yeah?”“yeah ……yeah……. yeah ……yeah ME.“No …no…. no…. no…. no.…no….YOU.”“What the fuck!”“Yeah I have never…I…I….I…never..”“Oops”“It’s not. . . it’s. ..not…not……..not…………..not…..why….”“Fucking…fucking….fucking… OOPS!”“I’m gonna….I’m gonna…..I’m gonna…I’m KICK your fuckin. . .TOO MUCH!”“Oops.”“Yeah, oops”“Spilt it.”“Fucking oops.”“What you done”“Oops”“Shocking behaviour”The “oops” theme continues for the rest of the night. It seems to be the only thing we can say to each other. We run around in the kitchen like lunatics. Darren is getting more and more uncomfortable with how little sense everything makes and hammers the remainder of his sandwich into the table before running round the house, knocking  things off the walls. And shouting  “SHOCKING BEHAVIOUR” a lot. We calm down a little and try and communicate. A while later I am attempting to make a cup of tea, but keep forgetting this, so am staggering round the house with the kettle in my hand, shaking my head. I am like a goldfish – losing my memory every 10 seconds.At this point I am overwhelmed by this feeling of familiarity with this state of consciousness. Even though I had never tripped on this scale before. I had such an intense feeling of déjà vu and I even said to Darren “I’ve been here before”, but he looked quite scared so I did not elaborate.  All these insane thoughts about my own existence began to rush through my head. I had the realisation that everything you see, touch, taste, smell, or hear, every thought or emotion you have, is just due to chemicals moving around in your brain. There is no such thing as life or death. The whole universe does not really exist and neither do I. I find myself asking what is real, and then knowing that it doesn’t matter. I am taken over by a surge of knowledge and meaning and euphoria, along with a sense of the complete pointlessness, ignorance and despair. I am full of a million emotions all contradicting each other, and the more  I tell myself  “It’s just the drugs”, the harder I find it to believe. When I close my eyes I am lost in this world of fractals and shapes and chequer boards, and get the feeling of being a ray of white light getting split by a prism. Meanwhile, when my self-awareness returns briefly, I realise I am shouting “JESUS! JESUS! JESUS! JESUS!” at the top of my lungs. Not out of fear, but out of sheer amazement at what these mushrooms are doing to my brain. So this was probably a bad time for D’s elderly and infirm grandfather to come downstairs. We had both completely forgotten he was in the house so the sight of him suddenly appearing at the kitchen door comes as quite a shock. He is just standing there, groaning, with wide eyes and gaping mouth. D is on the floor at the time screaming his head off about being “stuck in a loop” and trying to wipe slime off himself. He hasn’t even noticed him yet and I am staring right at him, almost shitting myself in mortal fear of an 85 year old Alzheimer’s sufferer who is genuinely shitting himself, while at the same time, laughing uncontrollably at the general absurdity of this situation. I am not even totally sure he is really there or if it’s just the shrooms, so I draw D’s attention to him. He stares at him blankly for about 5 minutes. Then D smiles and starts saying “don’t you fucking dare or I’m so gonna kick your ass!” I get hysterics again. We’re rolling around babbling like retards and this poor man is just standing there, scratching his head. Grandad doesn’t know what’s going on. I forget that he ISN’T tripping. D’s mum is sleeping upstairs. She, like grandad here, is deaf and for better or for worse, can’t hear the commotion down here. I suddenly begin to panic and tell D “we’re tripping we need to get him back to bed man, can’t have him wandering about” but I realise D is far too gone to deal with this situation and can say nothing but “SHOCKING BEHAVIOUR.”     It dawns on me that this man has come downstairs to find his grandson fucking up on the floor while some person he’s never seen before is pointing at him laughing his ass off, prodding him to see if he’s real.  Yet, I cannot stop myself laughing and prodding at him. And it also occurs that his Alzheimer’s isn’t so bad he can’t read my lips. So it’s not surprising he takes a swing at me. The sound of deaf people shouting angrily at you when you’re tripping this hard is a terrifying experience if, like me, you’re not used to it.  Especially when their paisley pyjamas are turning into a blanket of wriggling, kaleidoscopic slugs and their heads are completely out of proportion to the rest of their bodies. The image sends me into complete panic. I am suddenly flapping my arms about like an idiot, screaming “OH SHIT OH SHIT OH SHIT ITS UNREAL ITS UNREAL BUT IT DOESN’T MATTER OH SHIT”  still holding the stupid kettle in one hand, and the two large shrooms I hadn’t got round to eating in the other. I then forget all this and go to make the tea again, but have completely forgotten how to make tea. As I slap myself in the face in the hope it will help me remember, I hear D is still verbally kicking his grandad’s ass. I worry that he will soon physically start kicking his ass.  I realise I have to snap D out of it before this happens, so I try to do something about it by getting him up off the floor and straightening him out. Unfortunately, I had got the two of them mixed up and had  grabbed his granddad instead. Luckily I am not shaking him very long before I notice.  I attempt to sign him my sincerest apologies (although I am bloody useless at communicating with deaf people even when sober) and tell myself to go away into the lounge, sit down, and not move. The less input I have on this situation, the less damage I will do. It seems to work. I trip out in the lounge for about an hour and when I come out everything has calmed down. However D is upstairs convulsing on his bed, saying “Oops” and “shocking” periodically to no-one in particular. He is terrified, and paranoid and it soon gets to me too.  I try to put some music on to get us out of this dark, petrified state and calm us down, but suddenly have no idea how to operate the CD player. So we sit in the dark speaking demonically to each other like Gollum in Lord of the Rings talks to himself. We seemingly take turns being the evil Gollum and scare the shit out of each other until we reach the red screen and crash out for an hour or two.When we finally came to our senses (9:00am) we managed to piece together the events. Turns out D’s granddad doesn’t even remember what happened. Apparently he was only pissed off because we had knocked his coat on the floor during our headless-chicken phase. The more we thought about it, the clearer it became that nothing bad actually happened. But we both agreed that while very little was really going on at the time, it was too intense for either of us to handle. If the shrooms had just taken that little bit longer to kick in, we would have been able to get upstairs, get some music on and get comfortable. We would have enjoyed the most intense trip we’d ever had. The 10 minute come-up just wasn’t enough time, and as a result it all went horribly wrong.  Yet looking back, it wasn't at all bad! ARGH the confusion. I wasn’t about to let this bad experience put me off tripping. I ate some more the very next day in an effort to make my peace with the mushrooms. Different people and different surroundings. Great success. Had eight of the most exhilarating, enlightening and funniest hours of  my life. I was more worried by not being able to enjoy tripping again than the damage done to my psyche. In fact, the next trip seemed to repair any damage done and I  managed to solve a few problems in my life as well. So what have we learned? Before doing hallucinogens, I won’t drink too much, eat just a little beforehand, and NEVER do them around old people in freaky pyjamas. That’s just asking for it. After some research My wife & I decided to try blue lotus with the idea of having a pleasant saturday night in.  We decided on the lotus & wine method as shown in a UK channel 4 documentary. This coverage claimed this was the traditional way that the ancient egyptians would have taken Blue lotus. Neither of us want to smoke anyway and I have long since given up a tobacco addiction via cold turkey. I consider myself a little experienced in some of the cerebral tour guides (MDMA, cannabis, salvia and most legal highs). My wife is much more cautious, having swallowed a large dose of the modern and highly adulterated drug... 'facts' from a succession of 'war-on-drugs' pushers at early ages. However having seen the documentary with 'normal people on it' and me having sourced a supply (dried flowers & stems) in the UK she became excited though cautious by the prospects. I prepared the wine in the morning and that night we ensured that our young children were safely asleep for the night. The setting was our front room with subdued lighting and unusually no TV or music.+1 minuteWe are both wishing that we had bought a bottle of sweeter wine (we used 1 bottle of White Chardonnay) because even though our tastes are dry the flowers having being dried themselves made the wine taste bitter (though not enough to stop drinking). We agreed fresh flowers were probably better.+ 15 minutes The first feeling of 'something is happening' by her (she is much smaller in body mass). I was 'Is is it just the alcohol or more?'+ 20 minutes I get an unusual 'emotional opening up' feeling. I just wanted to talk with her 'not at her' as is my unfortunate habit.+ 30 minutes  Something is definitely happening.. Yes it is a bit like MDMA but also not at all like it. It is much more relaxing but the social/empathic bit is more gentle, wanting to connect & talk & laugh.+ 40 minutes We realise we have begun eating the soaked flowers and enjoying it for how long? it seems really funny we laugh a lot.This must be the peak I just want to stroke & touch her & talk & hear what she has to say. She feels much more sexual now unusually ahead of me. She talks about the way it makes her clitoris feel unsually stimulated it is very very swollen to the touch. It takes me aback; 'This is great for women' she says.....no wonder cleopatra looked happy! This bad joke is really funny to us. +50 minutesLong drawn out foreplay touching and stroking and talking and connecting more than we have for a long long time. Why have I been too busy to do this before? A little introspection.+90 minutesStill rising experience starting to get very aroused (it slowed me and sped her up - how good is this for couples!) Introspection gone.+120 minutesSlow deep horny + adventurous lovemaking. It feels like lovemaking is sex and sex is lovemaking if you know what I mean. She says it is lowering inhibitions (it is). She is talking about sex more than ever, communicating with me. This is helping me be a much more patient & ultimately rewarded lover.+180 minutes wonderful extended post (multi) orgasmic blissWe talk about it a lot. We talk about closing the distance that had grown between us since the birth of our children. We plan to do it again, 'oh god yes'. We wonder what it would be like as just a social thing not between a couple we agreed it would be a great for parties, a really social thing. We agree to introduce friends to it via a party punch and watch. We have fun imagining responses.Blissful sleep.Kids wake us up I feel fantasically relaxed she does too she runs 4 miles and says she feels great I cycle alongside with the kids feeling great. They can do nothing to bug me. Calm extends into mid week no real come down if it is it is very very gentle - like salvia, I feel I have been taught something. We agreed to experiment further with higher doses, longer soaks, etc. Have no plans to combine or adulterate it seems just fine with wine as if made for each other.Hoping for a day when signing this will not seem as scary as it does. I have enjoyed a life full of adventures.  I saw Terence McKenna speak in Maui twice.  I have smoked NN and 5-MEO DMT.  I have moved objects with my mind while on mushrooms.  I found God through Salvia Divinorum.  Had Synesthesia on Acid.  I had lots of fun, no doubt about it.  But I also had a tendency to push the limit, to always want more more more, and that led me into some very unfriendly terrain.  Crystal Meth addiction.  Ditto benzoes, opiates and GHB.  Suicide attempts.  Withdrawal from society.  Choosing to use substances which alter perception is a path riddled with land-mines.I stepped on many.  After years of experimenting with the more exotic substances, I found myself financially and mentally unable to keep up the frantic pace I had established.  Still suffering from a tendency to over-use, I began drinking more than I ever had.  I have always enjoyed beer, but found myself moving on to wine and hards.  My job suffered so I drank more to 'compensate.'  I was drinking in the mornings, drinking to pass out, drinking all the time.Days became weeks became months.  I was officially a lush.  It got to the point where in one day I drank a 750ml bottle of vodka.  And did the same thing the next day.  At this point my roommate had quite enough.  He drove me to the nearest emergency room, where I had a blood alcohol of 0.8-far over the drunk driving limit.  In the emergency room bed, I waited.  I talked to shrinks, who gave me some ativan (similar to valium) for the impending DTs - Delerium Tremens - Withdrawal symptom from heavy alcohol use, sometimes involving hallucinations.When I was finally able to walk straight, hours later, my roommate picked me up and brought me back home.  I curled up on my bed, depressed,  still extremely drunk, and just wishing I could go to sleep.  I was looking around my room (lights out) and noticed something strange.  It was similar to the visual effects I had gotten from taking 8-10 benadryls and smoking pot.  While looking at, say, the wall, it was as if a mosiac filter from Adobe Photoshop was applied to my entire visual field.  The solid brown of the wall paneling became many odd-shaped tiles of interlocking shapes.  They were also moving.  The tiles would arrange and rearrange themselves into different patterns.  After a bit of this, not content to be simple wall-flowers, the mosaic patterns started to extend into the space between me and the wall.  The action was becoming quite animated, with motion creating and recreating patterns now fully 3-D at an amazing pace.  Instead of indistinct shapes, the tiles began to cluster  themselves into beings - intelligent beings who were fully aware of my situation.  I could almost practically hear their thoughts as they morphed into a Dragon, a Lizard, Dinosaur Machine, terror elf, laughing cow.  All these were faces belonging to the same group of beings which were out to scare me witless.  Around this time, I began  feeling heat radiating from below - my futon felt as if it were on  fire.  And it was slowly rotating clockwise underneath me.  First visual and now tactile hallucinations.  Wonderful.Luckily, I had experienced hallucinations before.  These now reminded me of NN DMT visuals in complexity and activity.  Positive  that they could not physically hurt me, I let my eyes 'glaze over' in a manner that strengthens visuals when tripping.  The creatures assumed an amazing variety of forms to threaten my sanity with.  They appeared to be souls waiting to be born, the idea being that I had died and was awaiting my next reincarnation.  They called me by name, and assured me that I was dead.  Since I was absolutely sure that all this was 'just' a hallucination, I was able to face them down.  I felt that they were surprised I could resist them.  They expected me to be terrified, while I just lay there the watching scenes unfold, confident of my ultimate physical safety.This lasted about 3 hours.  Eventually the bed and walls slowed and finally stopped moving.  Disoriented and unsure of what to expect, I got up and walked to yet another emergency room, asking them if I was done hallucinating or if there was more to come.  I was lucky.  The worst had passed.The moral of the story?  Plants and drugs can be glorious blessings, providing access to spiritual realms in a visceral manner that churches cannot match.  Enlightenment and spiritual growth can result from proper use - specifically, dosing with the intent to grow into a better person.  Drugs can ease anxiety, lubricate social contact, help one sleep, sharpen one's wits.  But they do, without exception, change the way our body functions.  At reasonable doses and frequency of use, the changes last only for the duration of the drug in the body.  But an attitude of wanting more and more can easily lead one into physical dependence.  The reality of this was not clear to me when I started messing about with psychedelics and other drugs.  To me, it was all fun and games, until suddenly it was too late.  I found myself trapped in a snare of my own making.Addiction is a very real possibility, and should be seriously considered when choosing to use drugs.  Once addicted, you have to face withdrawal symptoms.  That's your body trying to return to normal functioning.  Withdrawals are every bit as bad as trips can be good.  Please respect yourself, recognize that drugs are extremely powerful, and choose to use them thoughtfully and carefully.  Otherwise, you only stand to hurt yourself and those you love.Postscript:  In America we are very lucky to have programs to help those who become addicted.  Yes, I'm talking about the 12-step programs of Alcoholics (or insert other drug here) Anonymous.  These groups are fellowships of people who have been addicted and found a way out.  And, more than just a remedy for addiction, these programs offer a viable alternative to using which is every bit as spiritually fulfilling as drugs can be at their best.  After using everything I could get my hands on for about a dozen years, sobriety was a major consciousness-change.  And I didn't lose anything I learned in my trips - rather, I gained a way to integrate those insights into a productive and healthy lifestyle.  Couple sobriety with yoga or meditation and you have a whole new trip altogether!  And it's legal and healthy to boot!  I actually feel that it was worth being a drunk just so I could have the AA experience.  There is nothing to fear in sobriety, despite what I had expected.  We all have our own reasons for using drugs.  Those same reasons might just be a reason to be sober.  Keep an open mind and an open heart. God Bless and Good Luck! I've tried this substance a few times now... started at 20 mg, went to ~30, then 35-40mg.  I plan to continue to go upwards a bit on the dosage, but I'm doubting any new revelations are to be had.  I'm not going to give an in-depth trip report, just my thoughts on  it so far.It seems the big question on everyone's mind is this - 'how does this stuff compare to MDMA (ecstasy)?'  Some might have touted this as a kinda E without the neurotoxicity.  In my experience I haven't seen that.  But I think the comparison is somewhat valid and interesting, so I'll use MDMA as the yardstick here.On social anxiety:  After the second experiment I remarked to someone 'If MDMA makes me Willy Wonka, I'm Fonzie on IAP'.  IAP would be my drug of choice in most social situations.  You're smooth, chilled out, timing of words is spot on, charismatic in an understated way.  If others in your space are rolling or tripping balls to the wall though, I would opt being a lovable etard.  On creativity:  Didn't make me feel especially creative.  Didn't exorcize any oddball speech, didn't feel like picking up a guitar.On the body buzz:  Nice, warm, surface type buzzz.  Whenever I sat down I noticed a really good tingle in my feet.  Nothing deep down though.  Sorta like being wrapped in a blanket wherever you went.  Nice walking outside in the cool breeze.On euphoria:  Not particularly euphoric alone.  Just chilling by myself, nothing.  But experienced much joy in the conversations I had.On empathy:  I would rank this pretty close to MDMA in this area.  It was odd because you don't feel it outright, but at the end of each experiment I definitely had attained a real closeness with those around me (5-10 people in each instance).  Most of these people were fairly new acquaintances. On mind-mush:  My mind was especially clear and focused.  More so than sober.  On introspection:  No, not particularly.On appetite:  Rather normal, maybe a little bit of the munchies.On fear:  Have no fear, this stuff is tame.  A shot of Jager I'd fear more. On dosage/reponse curve:  Pretty linear so far.On comeup and duration:  Comeup took long, about 2 hours.  Pretty flat after that, seemed to last about 6-8.On mixing with alcohol:  Does seem to deepen the experience somewhat.  And I'm not a fan of booze.On being a party drug:  Nope.  Can't see it.  This could be a good chill pill.  You know, if you had a machine to make pills.  It doesn't seem to 'give' you any energy you didn't already have to start with.  Neutral - not fun, but not not.On and on:  Nope.  That's the last colon.So in a nutshell, this is a kick-back substance, fairly transparent - will not potentate the goofy glow-stick wielding warrior inside you.  Yet socialization is the enabler.  You don't want to be home alone and watch TV - thoughts such as 'I'm kinda hot.  Maybe I should make some kettle corn' will iterate through your mind.  It's feasible as a therapeutic device. Work out that troubled relationship, maybe take on a first date, use at an alcohol-only party, beach, summer barbeques.  You know, 'normal' life activities. I was at the warm fuzzy champagne (quite) drunk stage at a new year's party.  And a little elf came by and suddenly I was saying 'okay sure' to trying some of this stuff.  I don't remember how the conversation started and at the time I had no clue as to what this stuff was except that it was a psychedelic.  Usually I'm very cautious about new drug experiences -- especially psychedelics, but turns out there's a world of difference between saying 'no' when sober and saying 'no' on glasses of good champagne.I think I was given 15mg at most -- 'a small dose' said the elf.  I drank it in a small gulp.  Tasted bitter.  I am usually rather sensitive to any psychedelic, physically as well as mentally.  I can really enjoy them, but as I get older, I tend to be more brittle and anxious if I get higher than I like.  But I guess due to my happy drunkenness and the elf talking calmly of small doses and no big deal, I had no pre-trip anxieties.I felt the effects start pretty quickly -- nothing there but champagne to stop them but it came on slowly in a non-threatening way like the beginnings of a happy acid trip. I think I was surprised when it just kept climbing.  I had not prepared for anything but a mild experience. There was someone at my elbow who I had been speaking to in a friendly way all night who I realized had also decided to try this stuff.  I suddenly felt that it might be good if we both went off to sit down and figure out how we were feeling.  Now I'm not sure if he felt that need -- but he came along amiably enough.We ended up in another room where two people were sitting quietly -- much less noise and activity than the original area, and settled on the futon.  I immediately felt more comfortable though I had not felt exactly anxious before.  Just the beginnings of 'gee this is going to be heavier than I though, maybe I should take stock'.I'm writing this a couple days later so I have more of a sense of over-view than a memory of each step of the trip.  I felt a some anxiety partly based on the normal mental scatterdness of the psychedelic experience but more due, I think to the somewhat overwhelming physical reactions.  I always feel like a react more strongly physically to drugs than my friends a lot of the time, but my 'partner' also mentioned that he felt rather physically overwhelmed.  I felt that I didn't want to move -- rather like that leaden pot feeling but stronger, like I was pinned to the futon.  I'm not sure how much time it took to get to this state -- one minute i was walking from another room getting kind of high, then i was on the futon discussing it, then I was pinned to the mattress.  On the other hand, the mattress felt rather comfy.  At some point I was getting waves of vibrating shivers going up and down my body.  My teeth were actually chattering. but I wasn't cold.  I also experienced some dry-mouth.  My trip partner said later that he had much enjoyed the feel of the coat i was wearing -- a delightful long-haired poofy thing.  So I think, though this substance effects one strongly physically, there's a positive buzz as well as the heaviness.  I also have to take into account the fact that i was way drunk when i took it.  I've never tripped drunk before.At the peak of the 'pinned down' phase, the oev were incredible.  the futon was part of a loft (underneath) so I had wooden slats with strong wood grain patterns including eyes overhead. The whole thing was shimmering and dripping in a really fun way.  Usually, for me, psychedelic visuals that intense are also blurred and disconcerting, like the wrong glasses prescription.  This was clear and surprisingly un disturbing.  I could actually enjoy it rather than freak out that the world was melting.  Or at least in waves I could.  Sometimes the thing would get a bit intense physically and my heart would race and I'd prop myself on my elbow and talk about it.  That would calm me down and I'd let go again and drift in and out.  Unlike most super-intense psychedelic experiences I've had, I was able to let go with the 4-acO-det and enjoy it in waves without feeling that my brain might dissolve into madness.I think the peak was mercifully short too.  Just enough to say 'weee, that wasn't so bad' and still feel like it kicked my ass hard enough to say 'woah, I think I had a good new year's eve.'As I remember, my conversation was very often about how I was feeling about the drug -- this kept me calm.  I was also in a non-introspective mood to begin with -- I also had never met the person I was speaking to before that evening so I was in 'acquaintance' mode, though feeling quite comfortable with it.I felt like I had come off a merry-go-round ride when I was done.  Disarranged and breathless and giggling a little. Oh and a bit funny in the tummy which resolved itself into a crampy knot -- no worse and not as bad as lsd or mushrooms have effected me.  And that's saying something considering all the champagne in my stomach. For such an intense experience, at the time, I thought it had been surprisingly clear-headed mentally.  On the other hand I don't remember much of it in detail.  On the other hand, I was drunk.I'd say all in all a fun experience, but I wouldn't do it to be social -- too intense, too short for a psychedelic. MDMA is so social that 4 hours is enough, but for psychedelics, I like more time to hang out and get friendly. And since that's usually why I do anything chemical these days I think that's my last experience with 4-ocetoxy-det, but we part very amicably. I began this experiment with little foresight, and I paid the price.  I began the evening with several drinks.  I had A LOT of gin, more than I should've.  I was most drunk.  I said, 'Hey, let's test the sacrament again!'  Ok..  Never attempted the nasal route, sounds easy enough.  100 mg DPT HCl salt in two quick shots.  Oh dear.  I can't see.. gotta puke. Seems too strong; I lay down on the floor, face down.  Now I'm gone, totally.  I had no concept that I was a person anymore.  I thought that I was some form of insect life, and I only say this after analyzing it later.  It was like I was a fly that was looking for some slime on the floor to eat.  There were other creatures like myself around me, and they kinda showed me what to eat.  I remember thinking 'oh yeah, we need this stuff'.  I was like a new born child in a new body, and I had to re-learn everything in this reality.  My mind tried to retrieve my ego and I thought, 'no, I'm insane now.  This is Art.'  I knew that I was not all right, but I also thought that there was no other way to be, and that if I was indeed insane, then that was it.  I had no memory of taking any sacramental supplement, nor any memory of my life up until that point.  I was comfortable being insane (there was no other way), I realized that there was no way I could ever communicate with another being again, except for these other insect creatures.  Suddenly, I was beyond my insect form, and I feared that I were dead.  It was not a scarry feeling, just one of total loss.  This is where it got really intense.  I was in a void of space, where other bodyless beings were swirling around madly.  We all had one purpose, to get 'THE THING'.  It was something that always avoided capture, like a point of light just out of reach.  We all screamed and moaned and ripped eachother's forms apart in an insane fit to GET THE THING.  Time seemed to stretch to infinity.  Of course we could NEVER get it, and I realized that this was NEVER going to end, and that I was damned to spend eternity trying to GET THE THING.  I said 'Let us make up some GAMES, so we may forget about the thing!'  Everyone else said NO!! WE MUST HAVE IT!!!  and we went back to our PAINful torment which seemed to last FOREVER..    Then it changed again and I was being spoken to by some oriental master.  He spoke his language which sounded tibetan or something like that.  I understood the meaning, but now that I think about the words he used (I can still hear them perfectly), I can't put it all back together again.  He was telling me there was a great joyous occasion taking place, and I felt what he said.  Many entities were preparing for this 'joyous occasion'.  He showed me how to do this strange chant, which I can't really put into words enough to type.  He put all this emotion/energy/compasion into the chant, like he was showing me how to feel.  It was MOST INTENSE.  I think I was crying in the vision ( I don't know WHAT my face down in the floor body was doing, probably slobering everywhere).  Then it changed AGAIN.. I was a pitiful beggar.  I was crawling around in the dirt chanting AUM MANI PADME HUM.  But it was as if those where the only words I COULD say.  They had to mean EVERYTHING.  Like 'DUDE' can mean every word, depending on inflection.  I would change the inflection of the mantra and it would take on new meanings each time.  I said it with the most pitiful, horrible, beggar's LOST HOPE voice one could possibly muster up.  I was at ROCK bottom.  I had NOTHING, not even death!  All I could do was BEG for ANYTHING.  And my begging was the mantra.  Suddenly, I was wisked away again, this time by benevolent spirits of Spring.  They showed me green parks and flowers and filled my spirit with the joy and desire to 'Get out there and give it your ALL!'.  They actually said that to me, with a smile and a laugh.  They made me so happy and like I was one of them, I belonged with these beautiful spirits of spring and youth.  We flew about quickly through the green lands.  I was compelled to open my real eyes.  My friend was face down on the floor next to me, and the room was swirling around like a TOOL video.  We both got up and were able to speak a few minutes later.  He had not seen such visions as I had, but was still most impressed.  We were back to a reasonable baseline within 3h from launch.I still cannot stop thinking about those visions.  I feel changed, like I died and don't know what to do now.  I feel like this 'life' is the 'game' I wanted to play to forget about THE THING.  I hear the oriental master's words ALL DAY, but I don't remember what they meant, it's all just 'a feeling'.  Overall,  too much, but very intense.  I still feel like my body is out of whack physically and mentally.  The Chiropractor took one look at me and said 'What in the world happened to you?'  He said there were several obvious signs of major stress in my system.  I would NOT recommend alcohol and these drugs.  Alcohol is not an MAO inhibitor, but it also can greatly affect the intensity of most other drugs.  This was a dangerous thing to do, and I would NEVER repeat such an experiment.  The ABSOLUTE safest way to take DPT is ORALLY or RECTALLY.  If combined with syrian rue seeds, the oral route is very nice, but lasts quite a while.SNORTING DPT IS TOO DANGEROUS!  Don't do it.  Too many people have serious MEDICAL issues.  How would you feel if you dosed your friend and he ended up in the hospital.  It happens A LOT.  100 mg rectally, with a baby medical syringe is by far the best way to do this.   Peace.Marz I started taking 2 tablets (300mg. each) of Olmifon (adrafinil) each morning.  I did this for 7 days or so before I noticed any effect whatsoever.The effect, at first, was merely a strange alteration in the overall energy levels in my body.  I no longer became exhausted and sleepy in the afternoon or early evening.  But, I could also go to sleep easier than usual!That fugue many people (not only college students) get, the brain just falls into an empty loop -- a brain fart -- is rarely present now.  Whether or not I'm paying attention, I am always thinking, but it isn't any sort of manic of compulsive thought drive.I have only been taking Olmifon for 2-3 weeks, so I cannot comment on any effects past this time, but I have not noticed any side-effects.  [Early worries of the 'inner tension' listed as a possible side-effect have been removed as the pain I felt initially was due, it now seems, to taking 10mg. of Deprenyl in one day, along with 600mg. of Olmifon.]It does not resemble amphetamines in any way at all, which I've found odd since it does awaken the mind so. OTHER:A potent oral opium extract at night had a sedating effect that lasted through to the morning and seemed to conquer any cognitive enhancement of Olmifon.  This day my brain was able to slip into the fugue mentioned above.However, alcohol (only tested with beer) at night does not seem to weaken Olmifon for the following day, like the oral opium did.Do not know if Cannabis knocks down Olmifon, I would image so.It seems that Olmifon is a mild attention-cognition tweaker that can easily be crushed with the typical assortment of stupifying drugs. [Syntopressin does bring back cognitive awareness in the midst of intense Cannabis intoxication.  Sadly, Sandoz has stopped production and the few remaining Syntopressin manufacturers have created a monopoly costly for the smart drug enthusiast.]Other than not being able to push past opiate intoxication, Olmifon seems to be a perfect addition to the medicine cabinet of college students and those needing a brain to function constantly throughout the day.Cost varies; Europeans should expect to pay less than 10 Euros for a box of 40 tablets, while Americans end up spending $20-$40 for the same box. Taking 2 tablets per day at this cost could get very expensive.  Besides, the literature warns against taking Olmifon for more than 5 months solid, without having liver enzymes checked. Well, after a rather rousing show at a local club, I went back to a friend's home and utilized a Fifth of Whiskey to an unexpected end.  Over the course of about an hour, I consumed the entire fifth straight and proceeded to become very drunk.  What must be understood is that I was doing this drinking only for the sake of being drunk.  I had not intented, nor had I ever heard of Alcohol (besides in the Uncharist) used spiritually.  Well...I, needless to say, felt very groggy very quickly.  I sat down in an overstuffed armchair with my feet up and instead of passing out, as would be typical, I felt myself 'slip' into a quasi-trance state.  With my eyelids fluttering, I was still perfectly aware of my body; sensations were normal (I could feel the cool evening breeze flowing through an open window).  But quickly, I had the sensation of moving OUT of my body, away and upwards through the top of my head (an odd one of a kind feeling).  I only then, after realizing I was in fact FEELING this that I began to actually SEE myself below.   Keep in mind this was like a division of consciousness here; I could still feel my body and feel myself away from it.  At this point I made the choice to concentrate on myself aloof from my body.  Well, quickly I was flying away from my body, away from the house...like I was being pulled away instead of directing myself away.  Well, I was pulled out into the sky, away from the city, away from the state away from the country until I was actually in space flying away from Earth and the Moon.  I went through a few asteroid fields as I cleared the solar system and continued outwards with increasing speed.  Moving away from the expasiveness of the galaxy, I watched it solidify into the spiral that characterizes it. On the same tolken, I was soon far enough away that It was like a mere star and every other galaxy about was the same; reduced to single points of light.  These too then began to coalesce until I was looking back at the universe at the point of the Big Bang; looking at the waves of energy that themselves created and formed into what appeared to be gyrating atoms.  These atoms TOO solidify into matter...and this matter, as I removed myself away from it further and further...I realized was a hair on my head!  I then gasped and sat straight up in my chair...laughing uncontrollably.  The entire experience took me less than a couple of minutes (by looking at the clock). T : 000 Ativan  10 mgT: 000 Valium : 5.75 mgT: 000 Tramadol : 450 mgKratom : 3 grams (premium) T : 030Soma : 3200 mg T: 030Cannabis : 2 bowls mg T: 045Alcohol : 2 beers T : 1:00I consider myself a psychonaut and have experienced many mind-altering drugs in the past: psilocybin, MDMA, DXM, LSD, Ketamine, Meth, Cocaine, 5-MeO-DMT, Salvia to name just a few. It makes me a better person. It started with curiosity, and now I am bored with the sober life. I have probably done MDMA 200 ~ 400 times, I would do all kinds from street quality (meth / MDA / acid)) to crystal MDMA, I average 2-3 pills per trip, and my frequency various – in 10 years time, I’ve done MDMA as seldom as twice a year to 3 times a week. MDMA makes me a better person. But I become the introvert and pessimist after the effects where off as my peers, or it seems they become the regular dude without ultimate empathy. The trouble is I am getting older and can feel the intense comedown for at least 12 hours. Moreover, it just looses magic and the symptoms are very uncomfortable. I’ve come across pharmaceuticals and these have given up psychedelic experiences for the most part because the benzodiazepines in particular the Tramadol and Valium hinder a once euphoric trip. I often feel there may be conflicts with my neurotransmitter. In fact, a couple times I felt I had “mild” serotonin syndrome, and enough to repel me from rolling because it is uncomfortable. I am addicted to Valium and Tramadol, and somewhat Soma for 2.5 years (daily). The trade off was not a good deal because I have physical / psychological problems versus living dangerously. I have countless combination and my doses have been low enough to taper off and times I binge, I have taken a higher dose (and more substances) in times I take like there’s no tomorrow. I will just take what I feel is a common “conservative” experience. T : 0:00 - I took the benzos and Tramadol first as they kick in at about the same time. (I believe the benzos help prevent the potential seizures that high doses Tramadol can bring on). I go downstairs to make a meal knowing I will soon take certain substances that will go together nicely. Due to my tolerance, I just feel a slight sense of well being and more excited as I will take soma and Kratom to achieve a comfortable synergetic effect.T :  0:30 - I take two fat tablespoons of decent Kratom to increase the effects of the opioid. The taste is not overwhelmingly bad, but I feel that Kratom is weak and prefer to chase with a think beverage (e.g. coffee, fruit juice). I quickly take Soma, a music relaxant. While I have taken more that 2500 mg in one shot, I am always careful to not exceed this too often as this is probably the most dangerous drugs of all I ingesting. Now I await the feeling that resembles a mild MDMA without the comedown. T : 0:45 I go outside and smoke a bowl a decent quality weed. Within five minutes, I feel a nice mild head change. Not too overwhelming but definitely stoned and very wobbly at this point. T : 1:00 - I’m drinking a Corona (not my favorite, but that’s all I had. I take my time to drink (about 20 minutes a beer) understanding that alcohol can cause unpredictable effects when mixed with the drugs like benzos and Soma. After finishing the beer, I feel so good that I drink another. At this point, my eyes are in the back of my head. I would describe this as mildly rolling but very much in control unlike even a mild dose of MDMA. If I try not to control, I catch myself feeling cozy and nodding off. The difference is with a liberal dose on Tramadol, I can perform well in a job interview whereas with a moderate dose of good MDMA you may still have trouble no matter what you tolerance is. Tramadol is different than opiates like Vicodin and Oxycontin because it lasts longer, the euphoria is mellow but much longer, I have more “mellow” energy and passion, and my thinking and judgment is not clouded. T: 1:30 - I am not into alcohol too much despite deliberate efforts to see if I could be. Apparently, at this point, it is not my favorite. I have good discipline when it comes to alcohol, but not for Ultram and Soma combination. The intention I have is to mimic a pseudo-MDMA like high, although MDMA is much more euphoric.  I feel the Soma very nicely, but am not tired. I feel intoxicated in a good way versus someone whom might purge. I rarely ever get sick on Ultram no matter the dosage -- I’m not sure if that’s a good thing. Other opiates that I enjoy 10% of the time without any pattern will make me nauseous, albeit the euphoria is much more intense. However, I can not only function on Ultram, but I am nicer and empathize with people in even professional settings due to the milder buzz. The Soma is something completely opposite unless my dose is light.T: 3:00 - The effects are good, but I fear the alcohol diminished the experience. I take an extra 0.5 mg Valium (not overdoing it as I eventually want to get off this medicine) followed by 2 more Soma pills. Perhaps I can sleep.Conclusion : Benzodiazepines, Ultram and Soma are a great combination. Just be careful since benzodiazepines can be more addicted that opiates (including Heroin). I take Valium as a safety precaution, but because I am aware how dangerous the physical addiction is, I usually try not to take too much. The alcohol may not be a stellar idea, and sometimes even cannabis can curtail the mellow euphoria I’m seeking. The advantage of taking trams with soma versus ecstasy is there is not hard come down.I know in reading this, you’ll probably think that I can be a better person without substances, but I’ve tried with no success. Besides missing them, I just feel that I am more outgoing and productive, ironically. It should be noted that earlier in the day, I took Ultram, Soma and Valium in my modest daily dose not seeking intoxication but normalcy. I have only been drunk twice. Both times were the most fun and worst times I have ever had with any recreational use of a drug. About six months ago M's (my 2nd best friend, a former pot head, but is now clean) car ran out of gas. He called me to help him push it into a parking space while R (another friend of ours who is 24) brought us some gas. It was Friday and I was pissed off about some stuff at school, so I decided to ask R if he could buy M and me a bottle of sigma seven. While we were waiting, M went around behind the building the car was parked in front of and smoked a bowl. He offered me some, but I hate pot. Shortly after he was done R arrived. He had the gas and put it in M's car. M and me politely ask R if he could buy us some booze. R said he would be happy to as long as we promised him we wouldn't drive. M and me agreed we wouldn't drive. We gave R the money and agreed to meet him at the back of a vacant church (Jesus drank wine, so shut up), were he would give us the bottle. M and me went to the back of the church were R met us and gave us a liter of cheap, 80 proof, sigma seven whisky. M was to sneak the booze into his house when he got home. I would sneak out of my house later that night, and walk over to M's house (M only lives about .2 miles away from me). M called me after we got home. He told me that a few other people would be showing up and asked if that was ok, I said it was.So, over the next few hours I talked to B (my all time best friend, the most fun and bad ass person you could ever meet) on the phone. He was really exited about me getting drunk and wanted me to call him later that night.At around 10:00pm that night, M called me and told me to come on over. I sneaked out of my house, I grabbed a walking cain (for the walk home), walked to M's house, and went through the door to his basement like I always do. M and me waited for about 30 minutes for the others to show up, but they didn't. M told me that we should wait till tomorrow to get drunk, but I pressured him into opening the bottle that night. He went upstairs and got a coke for chaser. We took turns taking a shot of whisky and then a shot of coke. This was my second time getting drunk. The first time I got drunk I only had a bottle of 20 prof wine. When the coke was empty, we each took a shot of whisky strait. After that, M hid the bottle behind his couch. We began to watch tv. I can't remember what we were watching. My conversations with M were much more interesting than whatever was on tv. Then the booze kicked in. M became slightly more relaxed and talkative. I, on the other hand, became really exited and REALLY talkative. I asked M if I could have a little more to drink. He said it was ok as long as I didn't drink too much: I should have known there is no way for me to just drink a little more, I should have never asked for another drink. As I learned from my prior experience with alcohol- once I get drunk, I can't stop drinking. I grabbed the bottle from behind the couch. Then I drank about 6 or 7 more shots before M forced me to stop. After that I felt like I was watching a movie about myself, by this I mean I was only watching my actions, but was not in control of them. M and me watched tv for a few minutes more before M had to go to the bathroom. When he came back, I was sitting on the couch chuggen more of the booze. M was freaking out cause the liter of sigma seven was over 1/3 empty. He took the bottle from me and put it behind the couch again. It was after 12:00pm when M said I needed to go home. I agreed with him and quickly grabbed the bottle from behind the couch and started chuggen. I don't remember how much was left after that, but the next day M said the bottle was over half empty after I left. At this point I was feeling something I had felt before, but not for a long time. I felt like I was a child in kindergarten again. I didn't need to worry about tomorrow, I had today. M decided he would walk me half way home.I picked up my cain, then stumbled out of M's house. Everything was beginning to blur together, I couldn't make out anything more than 30 feet away. When M and I got to his front yard, I pulled my pants down and urinated right then and there. After that, M and I continued to walk/stumble up to the top of the street. The whole time I was pretending I was in a row boat and my cain was the paddle. At the top of the street M asked if I knew the way back to my house. I recited the way, gave M a heterosexual hug, said good bye, and then continued my horrible journey home.It was then that the trouble began. I called B and talked to him. I remember yelling at him, telling him what ever I was doing I was doing at the moment. While I was talking to him, I came to the part of the road that I had to cross. It was at this road were I really began to lose my balance. When I tried to cross the road I fell down in the middle of the street. I scraped my knee and elbow fairly bad. B heard me fall and asked me if he need to call an ambulance. I saw that I wasn't bleeding bad, so I told B I was ok. I continued to fall down as I stumbled and yelled down the street. When I got to the end of the street, I realized I couldn't feel my glasses, they had fallen off some were on my journey. I back tracked, but I kept falling down so much that I couldn't look for my glasses. I was still raving at B, who then convinced me to, 'forget the fucking glasses and go home before you fucking hurt yourself!'. I listened to B and continued home.As I turned onto the street my house is on, I heard a women talking, but I couldn't see anything that wasn't right in front of my face. I told B all of this, and he started freaking. He thought I was hallucinating, unfortunately I wasn't. I remember a black shadowy figure (a woman, I couldn't see well enough to tell what she looked like) kept shouting at me. She was asking me if I had seen her dog. B heard her and told me to run before she called the cops, I didn't listen to him. By this point in time, the entire world was like a dream. I was had no control what-so-ever over anything that I said or did. I wasn't at all angry when I said what I was about to say, but because of the booze I yelled out at the top of my lungs, 'I haven't seen your fucking dog you bitch!'.B was cracking up, but the women sure as hell wasn't. She said, as you might expect, 'What did you just call me!?'. I  panicked and yelled back at her, 'No, no wait, I said itch, not bitch. I called you an itch! itch, itch, itch, itch!'. She then said, 'Are you intoxicated!?'. I, now almost half way scared, said, 'I ain't fucking intoxicated, I ain't fucking intoxicated, I ain't fucking intoxicated. Hey [B], am I mother fucking intoxicated!?'. B (who was on speaker phone cause I couldn't keep the phone near my head) said, '[C], You ARE fucking intoxicated. Now get away from her'. The last thing I can remember the lady saying is, 'I'm calling the police'. B heard what she had said and realized that this wasn't a joke anymore. B was screaming at me, he was saying,'[C] run! Get out of there! Go home! Run! [ect...]'. I did as he said and tried to run home the best and fastest that I could. Before I got home I looked over my back to see if the lady followed me, she didn't.I got to my house and crawled through the front door. By this point I could not walk at all. I couldn't even stand for more than a few seconds. B, still on the phone, kept telling me to go to bed. I was able crawl into my living room, but not without first breaking a bunch of pots I had made in my 7th grade art class. I picked up the broken pots the best I could. I then started to roll on the floor while trying to watch tv. Because of the alcohol, rolling around on the floor felt really relaxing. B was both scared and mad at this point. He had been telling me to 'Forget the fucking tv and go to bed before you wake up your mom!'. I couldn't handle the tv control, so I decided to do what B was telling me. As I was crawling through the hall leading to my room, I tried to stand up several times, only to knock over a bunch of pictures. I can only remember one thing after I finally got to my room. The last thing I remember is me telling B that I was going to go to bed face down so that when I throw up (I had not thrown up yet), the vomit won't go into my lungs.I don't remember anything after that. The next day my mother woke me up at 8:00am. I was laying sideways, not face down, but what was more shocking at the time was the fact that my entire body was completely covered with my own vomit. I was still half way drunk (I could control my actions, but I had difficulty concentrating and reacting quickly). I got out of bed, took a shower, drank some coffee, and went back to sleep on my now sheet-less bed (My mom had thrown my vomit drenched sheets in the trash while I was in the shower). I had to find my old par of scratched up glasses to wear. I never was able to find the par I lost. I felt like a piece of trash for the next 2 days. B called me later that day to see if I was ok. I told him that what I had done that night was, 'a big mistake'. I then asked him what he remembered about last night. He filled me in on the little details I couldn't remember. B told me to rest for the next few days, and never to drink that much alcohol ever again.Ironically, he should have listened to himself. A few months later, he drank half a liter of tequila. B, in his drunken state, got the idea it would be funny to call the police on himself. Because he was on his own property, and his parents didn't know that he had been drinking, he was just issued a citation, but that's a story for him to tell. I called M after I got off the phone with B. M had been really worried about me, he thought I was going to end up with alcohol poisoning. M and I both agreed never to drink like that again, if ever.All in all: I had the most fun that night that I've ever had using a recreational drug (yes, alcohol is a drug). At the same time, I had the worst repercussions from using a recreational drug I've ever had.I know my mother knows I was drinking that night, She had to have heard me. Hell! The people across the street probably heard me. My mother never confronted me about that night directly, even though she knew I had been drinking. It was obvious that my mom was disappointed with me, but she wasn't mad at me. The fact that she was ashamed of me, instead of being mad at me, added insult to injury. I think my mother wasn't mad at me because she knows that I learned my lesson on my own.The total amount of alcohol I've consumed since that night is 2 beers (and not at the same time either). The thing that disturbed me most of all about that night was NOT the falling down and getting hurt, or loosing my glasses, or disappointing my mother, or even almost getting arrested by the police. What bothered me the most about that night was the thought of how many brain cells I killed. I have an IQ of 134: I am a genius (according to MENSA), or at least I was. For weeks I couldn't stop thinking about all my  brain cells that I killed, all the things I can no longer learn,  THAT is what I found, and still find, the worst part of that horrible night. Even though alcohol is fairly legal, and the most accepted of all of the recreational drugs (except caffeine), alcohol is at least twice as powerful as ANY other recreational drug I've tried (including weed, speed, and salvia). To me, even the short term repercussions of abusing alcohol far out way its powerful, yet dangerous high. After my bad encounter with alcohol  (and several other depressants), I've decided to stay with speed for now. Speed is something that I can control myself on, and I don't get carried away with it like I do with alcohol and other depressants. I will still probably have a little to drink at celebrations and such, but not enough to get drunk. For as I have said, 'once I get drunk, I can not stop drinking'.I'm sorry if this report is too long and tedious. I've already listened to my Emerson Lake and Palmer CD 7 times, and sat in front of the tv for about 30 minutes, the total time I've spent writing and editing this report is over 5 hours (the time is 12:25am). The speed I took really makes me want to tell you the WHOLE story: even if it takes me all night to do so. I feel like going on and on about how others I know who have had experience(s) with alcohol that have been significantly better, or worse than my own. I feel like doubling the size of this report by writing about the first time I got drunk, but this report bares too much semblance to a Herman Melville novel as it is.   So, in conclusion to my rather long and detailed report on the horrible affects alcohol had on me that night:  I don't think that I will ever get drunk again, but even if forget how bad that night was, and I do get drunk again, it sure as hell won't be for a VERY long time. Background:Present are E, G, H and J.H is 26 year old, male, average height and slim build. Has taken this substance before in similar doses as well as more other substances than I care to count, including LSZ, NBOMe's, AL-LAD, some uppers, downers and side to sides. It may be worth noting he suffers from Bipolar disorder and says that this substance has put him in a better, longer lasting mood than even most things he has been prescribed.H's brother G (myself), male, 23, moderate experience with drugs. Lots of cannabis, Ketamine, AL-LAD, LSZ, LSD, 25B-NBOMe, mushrooms, MDMA, MKAT, dabblings with cocaine (very sparse), a whole spectrum of the recent 'legal-high' stimulants and smokables found in the UK. On average I have an experience like this every few months, on something different each time. I am about 5'11'', average build.The lovely E, my female SO, 24, has very similar drug experience to myself, although in lower amounts over time (especially viz ketamine & MDMA). E is about 5'4'', average build.E's brother J, 25, very little experience with anything other than cannabis, plenty of alcohol. Open mind, wasn't planning on embarking with us. J is about 5'11'' and similar build to myself.Setting:H and I met in a pub on a friday afternoon, we have a few pints of lager and retire to my house where E and J are waiting. We spend the evening in the living room with music playing. We're all close friends and generally have a lot of fun with each other. The mood of the evening is very light, we're all in a happy relaxed and similar mindset.Report!By the time we turn to the MXP we have all drunk a fair amount. H and I have each had 3 pints of lager and 4 or 5 additional cans by this point. E has had half a bottle of red wine and about 4 double Jameson's and ginger ale. J has had about 8 doubles of the same. J and E had both had a pizza in the mid afternoon, I don't know whether H had eaten, and I had had only a yoghurt and some pork scratchings.T = 011:00pm: E, H and I decide to break out the drugs. We split the 500mg into three piles, each of which is then split in half, and one of these piles each is split into two. We each therefore have around 160mg each; one pile of around 80mg, and two 40mg piles for later on. We wrap the larger piles in Rizla and swallow with some beer.Over the next hour we chat more and wait for the effects. We are slightly drunk, but not really noticably. Over this period of time we start to feel slightly dizzy (possibly an alert) but otherwise pretty normal.T+1:30~12:30The effects start as a mild dissociative. None of the silly headedness or flailing and lolling that I associate with ketamine, but a similar bodily effect. The limbs seem further away and less responsive than normal. The room closes in slightly and seems more cluttered. Feeling slightly disconnected from our bodies and words; as though you are present and viewing thoughts develop and turn into sentences which are delivered to the mouth, but this is not done with any of your own input, this is all as expected and causes no concern. We are thinking clearly (if slowly and ramblingly) and have pleasant conversations all round. Music sounds accentuated, and we listen to a variety of mostly electronic tunes, all with a fairly slow, laid back vibe. At one point some Nu:tone is introduced, but feels to fast and staccato for anyone to get into, which is unusual as it was E's favourite song. Mid 90's Aphex Twin and Squarepusher seems to be the order of the night, and we all enjoy it greatly. J continues drinking Whiskey and getting to his normal innebriated self (loud, slightly belligerent, but ultimately harmless).T+2:30~1:30 AMThe peak of the first dose. Since the last paragraph all the effects described above have risen in magnitude, and additionally, we are now all quite spaced out. Lots of cuddles and empathetic conversations are had. Stretching out on sofas and floor feels wonderful. The 'ketaminey' feeling of being composed of soggy crystals moving round in a sauce takes over. Everyone enjoys talking about melting into carpets and sofas. E repeats the word 'chewy' whilst grinning like a maniac. I roil around on the rug like a seal, enjoying, for example sitting with my head under the coffee table looking at the small surroundings under there; I'm still in this world, but it's nice to be in what I think of as a tiny little ecosystem which I am surveying, looking round at the balls of fluff on the rug, smiling. Disassociation is very strong. Moving takes time and is a great, sweeping experience, movement is accentuated and vision blurs slightly. Every thing is very fun and we have no trobule engaging with each other or the world. Dexterity is diminished. Controlling the laptop or rolling cigarettes is an interesting challenge to embark upon which takes much longer than usual. We keep listening to music and chatting, but conversation is more transient and nonsensical. Body load is low, a moderate feeling of fuzziness in the head distracts me when I'm on my own in the toilet. At this point I would describe the drug as like ketamine but cleaner. The world is very much the world, and we are clearly inhabiting it, as opposed to some soup of odd perspectives and gravity shifts.T+3:00~2 AME, H and I feel the effects are tailing off. The disassociation has reduced and we are sitting fairly still, wondering what to do with ourselves. We decide to take the first of our smaller hits with some more beer. At this point each of us has had at least 6/7 cans each. J has nearly finished a bottle of whiskey. I would say that drinking did have some effect, but that it felt like there was a larger reservoir to fill before actual drunkenness set in than usual. Body effects are barely there any more, the fuzziness is also gone. We take 40mg each.T+3:30 to T+4:302-3:30 AMThe mad times. Everything round this time is hazy, but not a complete blank. The second come-up is quicker than the first, and takes us further than before. Most of this time is spent in fragmented conversation about how we felt. (I came up with the analogy that I was an increasing set of open brackets in some source code, new scopes opening up within the old with every passing thought). Time seemed for a while as though it was passing in discrete chunks, movement seemed jerky and discontinuous. Images seemed skewed and blurry, but no serious distortion. E has nothing to report from this section of the night, except for a vague memory of well being, almost a total blackout. I can confirm that she seemed the same as the rest of us. Cogent, engaging, mobile and not insensible. Some time around this section it is (somehow) mooted that J would take one of the remaining 40mg bombs. No-one remembers how this happened; E thinks it has something to do with his watching us in this state (come on, that'd pique anyone's curiosity). Despite knowing his complete inexperience, E somehow consents, and J takes the package with beer. We continue in the same vain, myself sliding round the rug making different textures of noise to please myself. H says the usual silly nonsense of his trips; theories of consciousness, how to live life, etc, etc (he is rather intense on drugs, this will come back later). The mood is very spaced out and trippy. Everything is good, physically still feeling fine and cogent, but all though was of silliness and wooshing noises. If we close our eyes, there isn't darkness, but a field of pin-prick lights, both static and flowing, and a sense of smooth, fast movement. This doesn't get too much and E, H and I each spend time, eyes closed, enjoying this novelty.T+5:004:00 AMJ begins loudly talking about how it's having no effect on him whatsoever. The rest of us are out of the forest, but not back in our boxes yet, and J is peeving us slightly. I believe he possibly experienced threshold effects, but could not tell it apart from the bottle of whiskey; this seems in line with the response curve we experienced. He just seems drunk as ever. We tell him to be quiet and wait, or at least just be quiet and 'stop harshing our mellow, dood'. We are starting to feel a bit tired and listless. More dizzy than anything else, now. It is still possible to enter the spiralling thought trains of the drug, but it comes less naturally, and we mostly just talk listlessly. E reports that at this point her memories start to come back. We keep drinking beer and almost go on a walk to lift the tedium of sitting here without much drug left. We don't though as we agree we are too drunk and tired to deal with the possibility of running into someone.T:+7:30 ish6:30 AME and G take the final two bumps. J is pretty much fast asleep on the sofa, adamant to the last that he had felt nothing. He seemed slightly more slurred and unbalanced than usual, but nothing more than that to signal he had had anything other than booze. Things have calmed down by now, but we're definitely still feeling the previous bump. We no longer want to be in the untidy living room, and so agree to take J to a bedroom; we supported him up to the room, him muttering all the way about the stupid drugs. He wanted to keep drinking to make up for his perceived loss, but was still quite content to fall asleep the moment he touched the bed. He stayed in exactly the same position, asleep until we checked on him 7 hours later. E, H and I went to my room to watch a film and generally settle down. H decides that what we really need to watch right now is The Seventh Seal, a Swedish art house film with terrible subtitles and a plot as obscure as.. well, as obscure as they come. It made no sense and was packed to the gills with disturbing imagery. Everything about how it was shot seemed to put E and I on edge. I tried to settle into it and just get a buzz from how freaky the whole thing was.T+ 8:307:30 AME and I are back up on the drug, nowhere near where we previously were, but reading the subtitles is difficult, and we are becoming more and more freaked out by the current situation. H is acting strangely, talking about high concepts and how life must be taken to the edge. E and I are trying to block this out or take him back to more pleasant conversation, but he almost seems to enjoy scaring us. About an hour and a half into the film I have had enough. I gently tell him that this is the worst bloody film to watch in our delicate states, and ask him to leave us alone for a while. It's worth noting at this point, both E and I felt our faces looked contorted and dark when we looked in the mirror or at each other. E notes she felt particularly freaked out because she looked like an old crone with a long hooked nose and a twisted face. I felt similar distortions, I suspect this was us having stared for so long at the stark cinematography and bleak faces of the obscene film. It subsided after a while. H goes downstairs for a cup of tea, E and I try to settle down for some rest, but start talking about how weird the situation felt.T+108 AMOur conversation continues and we worry ourselves more and more, H's actions start to seem almost malevolent, cruel. We reflect on the conversations with him and reflect that he really did seem to be gleeful at recounting his eccentricity and intenseness. I resolve to go downstairs and quiz him about this drug some more. We feel concerned for J, having drunk more than us and taken the substance with no prior experience.T+9:308:30 AMAt this point I should expound more about H. He is a psychonaut as I have mentioned, and since first trying a dissociative, has been chasing the feelings of stability and calm they give him. He told me before this experience that MXP had put him in a lasting state of calm focus. Emotionally connected and free of frustration, like he had not been for a very long time.E and I feel that we are worringly far from baseline, and ask him about the lasting effects of the drug. He talks in a rather obfuscatory tone, but generally convinces us we have just been strung up by watching the film whilst still so high. He continues to say contradictory things like “You'll be back to normal by midday... but think of this as the first day of the rest of your life”. E becomes briefly tearful and checks on J who is sleeping but responsive. I ask H to leave after he finishes his tea, saying we need to relax and get back to baseline. We apologise for getting so tense, but he leaves happily.E and I retire to bed much calmer and happier. The rest of the drug subsides slowly and sedately. We are not at baseline for a good while, but are feeling normal, just hungover at this point.10 AM – 12 AMWe lie in bed recovering. By now feel pretty much back to baseline. A bit of residual dizziness but mostly tiredness by now. We order Peri Peri chicken and it is immense to eat again. J arises, completely fine (albeit very hungover). He says in bed until 2 PM, and afterwards walks round like a zombie (this is completely normal, even when he is not hungover).12- 7 PMWe lie in bed more. Not feeling the empty headedness of other types of come down, but still feeling tired. Lots of low-energy fun is had and we giggle at comedy on the laptop. Some low-key sex is had, we both enjoy it, I have no trouble performing (albeit briefly). Around 4PM, J leaves. We are on our own, feeling no compulsion to get out of bed.~8 PME and G get some cannabis (on a stupid gallavant where we end up walking round the block twice and almost panicking at a police car). We each have a small joint with ~0.3g of medium strength cannabis. Within ten minutes the joint has hit both of us much harder than usual (we smoke a 3g bag maybe once a week over a few days. We're inveterate stoners, so are surprised when we feel more zonked than usual from the joints, with mild tachycardia, fidgeting and sweaty palms. We don't get too worried and return to being pleasantly stoned after another 10-20 minutes.10PM E and I go to sleep. We sleep for about 12 hours. Waking up refreshed, thoroughly baseline, with slightly sore backs. No ill effects felt at this point, we write this at 5PM that same day.Closing remarks:I really enjoyed this substance, it was just as H had described. Very strong dissociative, but with minimal body tension and a very clear head throughout. I very much liked the slightly trippy headspace I spent most of the night in, babbling like a baby (as on K) but more internally lucid. E notes that we underestimated the effect of outside influences, and watched that silly bloody film way longer than we would or should have done, E hated the panic induced by worrying about J, and says she would not have consented to him having his dose had she been in a right state at the time. Overall though, we agree the panic was caused by the film and H's odd behaviour. Overall nothing negative really happened, and we all feel fine :)8/10, might try again. I decided to make this report because I have only been able to find one other instance of someone making this kind of drink and I wanted to share my personal methods and experience with this classic drink. Aka the Vin Mariani.In the report I discovered, the individual used the ratio of 2 grams coca leaves (acquired from coca tea bags) per oz of wine. Through his experiment, he discovered that in order for one to experience the stimulant effects of cocaethylene (the active drug that is extracted), one needed to squeeze the tea bags after they had been soaked in the wine.I decided to try and reproduce this experiment, though I had some slight variations.Materials:-metal or plastic teaspoon-small plate-8 oz of merlot-Nalgene bottle with measurements on side-Large mason jar -Fine mesh strainer-18 coca teabags (Windsor brand) - each containing 1 gram of coca leavesNote: I used 18 teabags because I just felt that using a bit more might correct any margin of error that could make it weaker.Procedure:1. Pour 8 oz of wine into Nalgene bottle.2. Open all teabags and empty them into the wine.3. Stir lightly or use some kind of cylindrical object to press the coca leaves down into the wine. You don't need to do this excessively, just enough to make sure all the plant material is soaked in the wine and not just sitting on the top.4. Let the Nalgene sit for a while. I let it sit for about 2.5 hours but I imagine you could let it sit for as long as you like.5. Set up the mason jar so that it has the strainer set on top of it (you'll probably be holding it in place) and *slowly* pour the wine/coca leaf mixture through the strainer. You'll have to do this in a series of pours since the leaf material clogs the mesh--but this is good!6. After each small pour, use the teaspoon to press the coca leaves against the mesh. Push until no more wine drips into the jar. Then place the dry plant material from the strainer onto a plate.Repeat steps 5 & 6 until all the wine/coca leaf mixture has been pressed into the mason jar.7. Now here you have two options, which I will denote with a) and b).a) Get rid of all the plant material by throwing it away or bagging it and taste your delicious fortified merlot!b) Use the dry plant material from the plate again and put it back into the Nalgene. Add wine from mason jar.Repeat steps 4-6.I personally just went to 7a, but I imagine that you could resoak the leaves one or two more times and have pretty good results. Subjective effects:Male, 5' 9' 130 lbs. Experience with a wide range of substances.Took a reasonable sized sip of the merlot from the mason jar on an empty stomach.t+0: No particular effects other than a slight warming of the stomach from the alcohol.t+4: Rather than experiencing the usual relaxing effects of wine, I noticed what seemed like a minor brightening of my surroundings. Still no significant mental effects. Took another good sized sip.t+6: Found that I was actually starting to feel stimulated. A sense of confidence and well-being could be felt simmering in the background of my mind. I smiled.t+30: Gotten to what I think is the plateau of the effects, but they're not dropping off. Feeling calm focus, energy, slight speediness but not overwhelming. Feels like a very soft version of cocaine.At this point I decided to put the cap on the jar and store it for later use. I think this drink can really only be used moderately as I imagine it could make you pretty sick (I've read elsewhere that drinking too much can actually make things take a turn for the worse). However, I see it as a perfect adjunct to scholarly activities (not memorization) such as writing papers, writing creatively, and doing readings. A very relaxing, stimulating drink for the enjoyer of fine pleasures.May you all enjoy, I hope this works for you as it did for me! Peace and Love.

I have used marijuana only 3 times in my life and I never really enjoyed the high very much.  On this particular night, however, I was drinking heavily and I was surrounded by 5 very close friends who could all be classified as “pot heads”.  When the night grew late I slowly began to be curious about weed (even though I knew I didn’t like the high when I was sober).  And after watching all of them take huge hits from their bong, I decided to give it a try.My friends were all giggling as I grabbed the bong and placed it to my lips.  I inhale drastically and hold it in as long as I can.  I immediately feel light-headed and lay back in the couch.  I close my eyes and just listen to the sounds of the room as my head was spinning from already consuming approximately 9-10 beers. After about 20 minutes I begin to get intense chills down my spine.  At this point I can still see straight and I am aware of my surroundings.  I look at my friends as they all laugh and watch TV.  I try to force a smile, but I am pretty uncomfortable because of these chills down my spine.Another 20 minutes go by and I can no longer see.  My eyes were open but I could not make sense of anything I was seeing.  The intense chills turned into an almost electrocuting sensation throughout my entire body.  I knew something was wrong so I tried to tell my friends but I truly had no control over my speech.  I couldn’t keep a thought long enough to form a sentence and I began to shake slightly.  Not sharp shakes but more of a fast rocking of my head.As I closed my eyes I began to hallucinate back to times of my childhood.  I remembered taking Spanish classes in elementary school and I vividly played back my thought processes for trying to remember words with very abstract means. I still don’t know if those were real methods that I used or if I was hallucinating a memory.  It was an extremely uncomfortable time as I remembered extremely strange patterns that I cannot describe.  All the while I was feeling intense electrical shocks throughout my entire body and I was more uncomfortable than I have ever been in my life.  Throughout the trip I continued to hallucinate and get extremely scared.  Like I was living in a very bad nightmare, fully conscious, but unable to move or speak to my friends.  After an hour of this hallucination my body simply had enough and I puked everywhere, out of nowhere, and uncontrollably.  My friends all jumped to my rescue and gave me a bucket as I heaved my guts out for 10 minutes.  After puking, all hallucinations stopped and the chills stopped as well.  I was extremely exhausted so my friends gave me clean clothes and I passed out.  The next morning I was completely fine. Not even a hangover.  From that day on, I swore that I would NEVER try marijuana again. Something about it simply doesn’t agree with my body. I ordered some 100mg bk-2C-B pills off the internet. I felt like getting something a little special, shroom season had come and gone and 6-eapb has had mixed reviews. I quite enjoyed the 6-apb that 6-eapb had been spawned to replace. I had my first pill an hour prior to when I was due to meet up with my friends, Bob and Rick.  The feeling of anticipation had been building, there was a beautiful orange sunset that lit the clouds from below, they were uniformly corrugated across almost the entire sky, that hit me as I walked out of ASDA, I was with my parents, they appreciated this as much as me, and this alleviated my fear that I was already 'on the coaster'.  I hadn't tripped for several months before hand and only 6 months ago I had been sold dud 25i tabs.  Several experiences in my life have led me to have immense respect for placebos......and if the power of belief can cure cancer it isn't hard to imagine tripping on that same power of belief. So after an hour and a half there was still no sign, at this point I was starting to think I had been scammed, I gave Rick and Bob one each and I had another, and another, silly. Me, Rick and Bob went to play pool, we all bought a pint and an hour passed with a growing buzz that I was still attributing to a placebo, my friends believed they could feel something whilst we were playing, it was only as we were getting up to leave, about 2 hours after I had my first pill, I realised, these were real drugs! My friends found that quite funny, Bob suggested I throw up but I wanted to ride this out and see where it took me, I enjoy heavy trips but I was being irresponsible here, I had never taken this substance before and I knew there was a good chance of a steep dose- response curve, 80mg low dose, 100mg mid dose, 120mg high dose, I don't know if this is correct, there is very little info about it on the web, I had never taken bk-2c-b or 2c-b,  but I cannot be sure bk-2C-B has a strong dose response curve until I try smaller amounts.So the trip became a little bit of a worry at first, in fact the whole thing was a bit out there, I only have myself to blame! We went to a pub and went to the toilet but this didn't work great although it took away my paranoia that I was going to poo myself, just a twinge of nervous bowls I guess, the paper jammed also, but this wasn't mission critical, Bob checked I was ok when I was in the toilet, I made very little mental assessments after this, the trip was too strong for me to enjoy, also I was uncomfortable with the strength of psychedelic disassociation whilst in town centre on a Saturday night, with strong physical effects such as cramps in the intestines that made me feel like I was going to keel over if I didn't stop in my tracks and take the feeling seriously, I also had to watch that I didn't get too excited as I could feel it might cause palpitations and my heart would go out of rhythm (these are things you really don't want to have to worry about when tripping). Another friend joined us later on about T+5 hours, Jools, we met him at the top of a pub. I had my second and last pint for the night, I just had water after this. There was a piano, I like to hear the notes, but my mind was too taken up with being ok. I needed a piss, I couldn't go on the urinal wall, too many people, nervous bladder now, I get this normally anyway, I wasn't embarrassed, even though my fellow urinal 'pissers' were poking fun don't worry we are not having a peak lad this is an old mining town so that kinda banter flies around, its a very interactive place.  On tryptamines I would have been more affected by this moment. I felt very military about the whole operation, I marched down the fire escape and found a pub down the way.  The world was fuzzy but not in a tangible way. Lights couldn't be contained in glass tubes, flickers and sparkles got carried on the breeze. Auras rose into the deep late autumn sky. It was the 30th of November and the town was buzzing but I was enjoying a few seconds out, a few seconds by myself as I walked back from The Goose. Buildings looked like they were about to unfold and fold into something else, anything felt possible like it could all melt at any moment, the whole world, reduced to a greasy mixture of its components, any thing was possible but I wasn't looking for it. I was riding it nicely, but I certainly wasn't beckoning it, and tripping out was way down on my agenda below 'being ok'.We retreated to my friends flat a couple of hundred meters down the high street, he lives in the top flat, 4 floors up. I splashed some water on my face. The carpet melted into itself from 8 or so different angels, I felt more comfortable, my ego was still half intact but very quiet. My friends were sitting around rolling up doobies so I sat down and began rolling up a doobie. My weed didn't look right and I gave it to a friend to inspect. It looked false and contrived, usually buds looks like emeralds to me whilst on 'things',  he said it looked nice. Now a few days later in waking life, its still not my favourite stuff, its too skunky and souless but it certainly is cannabis. We went for a walk to the park. A young girl got murdered there not so long ago, one of those things, broad daylight, could have happened anywhere. I put rest to that thought quickly, but in truth wouldn't have had the wits to pursue it if I tried but I was becoming more confident now, still spangled but in a better place, out of the rough, it was nice standing around with people I trust, far from the madness of snivilisation, the stars were the brightest I had ever seen them, we stood about and had a smoke, I felt more in control after a puff.We left the park and stood for a moment in the up and coming part of town, where a huge theater stands with a water fountain outside of it, and the streets are clean, and level. The world was very flexible at that moment,. Colours bounced about, the edges of things did a very poor job, translucent gasses took up shapes that dissolved before they assumed real meaning, ghostly vines made of smoke and water vapour that sank back into the concrete they grew from. If I acknowledged this at the time and seen where it took me the whole thing would have turned inside out, maybe another time, probably with another drug, for me at least this isn't one to push. Bob went back to his flat, Rick and myself got a lift back from Jools which was great because a 3 and a half mile hike at 2 or 3 in the morning would have been a pain, to say the least. The drive was incredible, immense, just fantastic, zooming through the night, sodium street lights burning orange, tarmac reflecting the sky, the world is devoid of life! I was feeling happier physically now also knowing I was going home and all would be well. I was with friends and I was also feeling comfortable in this new psychedelic skin, although I was still tragically disorientated and mentally scattered. Skinning up was possible but took half an hour or so. I've been more debilitated off 300ug of LSD, although that seemed to peak and then quickly things got easier, whilst the debilitation in this stuck around.Time was quite slow but nothing like what I've experienced with tryptamines. We smoked the joints and my friends came inside my house (parents house). It was 3 in the morning and my folks were asleep so we had to be quiet, we went upstairs. Google Maps was changing colours and zooming in and out at megaspeed. I took amusement in my brain being so willing to visualise on a computer screen because it didn't see the image from the computer as reality.  I took this thought and looked at a painting on the wall of a nude woman. She began dancing, moving naturally but in a stuttered way and becoming more and more real. She was an opaque vision, there was no question she was dancing. Colour was coming off her, Indian maybe, more south pacific maybe. Translucent clothes, swirling around as she moved. I've only had this a few times in my life, strangely off MDMA before, strangely never off LSD.  This is very real to me this kind of imagery. Much of what I experience is psychedelic smoke and mirrors, when I beckon a thought out of my imagination it will not be as real as what manifests when left to its own devices, this is because I am aware I imagined it and this is ingrained into what I am experiencing, but she has to stay in the picture frame, I'm not ready for her to come to life yet...... The problem with me taking too much is that I didn't feel comfortable in its hands, I didn't feel comfortable being taken up by it. I took a well deserved rest for six hours and got up the next day, bright sunshine lighting up the curtains, too yellow, oh no, I'm still in banana land. I never slept, this reminded me of amt. I was just in a trance for a few hours, it probably looked like sleep but it didn't feel like sleep. I was psychedelically exhausted but there was too much of a stimmy side to that bk-2c-b. I had a slight headache. I had a cup of tea and went for a walk in the sun, I had a bit of a smoke, I listened to doctor Lonnie and David wonderful interpretations of Beck. I sat up a tree and went home and watched shite TV all day.......... Come Dine with Me......watching real people interact helped return me to normal.The day after this I felt fine. I don't want to make too many assumptions about lower dosages, Rick and Bob had an interesting spin put on their night, Rick had tried 2cb before and said it was very similar. Physically this was much nastier than 30mg of 2ce, although I didn't have any bodyload on bk2cb, I didn't feel particularly sick either, a passing gippyness (slight sickness) at times but nothing much.  Walking was nice, I kind of drifted on 2ce.  Bk2cb has more energy, also it didn't have the strangeness of 2CE, I prefer 2ce for its strangeness, but I would think twice about taking it around town with me if only because the body load. I think bk2cb might be good for certain situations, not parties, not trips, but for all those things in between - BBQs, football matches, christenings, etc Background: 29 year old male.  6'2' 250lbs.

I administered St. John's Wort, Valerian Root, and Melatonin to myself around 3am.  I feel asleep right before 4am.  I woke up around 7am.  I had a hangover from drinking 8 high gravity beers, plus the usual feel from synthetic psychedelics.  By the afternoon, I felt fine.  I rested, and exercised (as sweating out the toxins is the best means to recovery).  Overall it was a great trip.  I never really got too out there.  It also never really reached the level of intensity I desired, but that was also expected given the dosage of each substance.  As a side note, I find kratom to be an excellent substitute for marijuana when it is absent or not available.  I had purchased an e-cig from a local head shop which had a kratom cartridge in it.  It def helped in the trip and intensified the trips at times. Let me start out by saying that up to this point the only drugs I had experimented with were weed, pain killers like Vicodin, and ecstasy a handful of times, although since I have added a few more under my belt. I have yet to have an experience quite as astounding as this one.The few experiences I had with beans up to this point I enjoyed immensely and that's putting it mildly. So me and a few of my buddies decided one Friday morning that we should roll that Friday night. Normally this wouldn't be a problem since we live in an area where drugs are easily accessible. So we thought not much of it to go ahead and get all of our supplies before calling up one of the five thousand dealers I knew. Me and my best friend, I'll call her S, went to wal mart to get all the essentials like glow sticks, glow bracelets, vicks and vicks inhalers, 10 bottles of water, fog juice for my fog machine. Things we already had: two strobe lights, a fog machine, a laser light, and some little light dome I found at wal mart. It's supposed to go in pools and tubs and the like but it's pretty trippy when you're rollin too. We got home with all of our supplies and it's still relatively early in the day, about 5 pm since I had gone straight from work to wal mart. So I decided to have a few drinks in the mean time while waiting for all my friends to gather and converge at my place.Now, this is a very small, close group of friends, in my opinion that's the best way to do it that way you are completely comfortable with your surroundings and can have the best experience possible. Might as well if you're paying 10, 20, 30, or more for a night of rollin. Before I know it, it's 6:30 and my friends come over to find that I am quite drunk. Now that every one is here, it's time to get the drugs. I call my usual dealer to find that he is dry. Ok. I call next in line, only to get the voicemail. I call third string, to no avail. I must have called 7 people with no luck, every one was dry. Needless to say, we were pretty disappointed. But no sense in letting the night go to waste! I go and grab a bottle of vicodin I had been saving for a rainy day and popped 3 of them, and the other people I was with popped 1 each. We are all drinking and having a good time feeling lightly buzzed from the vicodin and liquor.One of my friends, I'll call him R, suggests that we do some powder. Well, I had never done it before, so was a bit nervous but did not hesitate to say let's do it. R made a phone call and within 30 minutes we had an 8 ball. At this point it's about 7:30 and R starts chopping up the rock until it is a fine white powder and proceeds to separate us all out some lines. R offered me a bump since it was only my first time, to which I quickly declined. If I was going to do it I was going to do it big. I watched R and S do their lines, and I was next. They handed me the half a straw, and I quickly bent down and took the 2 most robust lines I saw. I sat back and tried to act casual, didn't want to seem lame by freakin out over how good I felt. I watched my friends T and W take their lines. I decided then that I was going to be taking W to bed with me that night, which isn't like me, but the coke had me on a whole different level then I had ever been on before. We continued to take lines until...RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING...         RIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIIING...Can it be? My second string dealer! And he is far from dry! We go ahead and buy 20 for 130 (at that price, why not?) and he brings them over to the house and everything. We waste no time as it is now about 9 pm and each of us had things to do early the next day. Me, T, and W all take 4, and R and S take 3. We decide to take a few more lines while waiting for the Ecstasy to kick in. At this point I start to worry that maybe my tiny little frail body can't handle all these foreign substances at once. I'm drunk as a skunk, the Vicodin is trying to pull me down, and the cocaine is pulling me up and I'm about to roll like a stupid fool. I stop these thoughts dead in their tracks with 3 lines of cocaine and a cigarette. I can feel the XTC starting to work on me.It's about 9:30 now and we pop open all the glow sticks and distribute them, me and S putting them around our necks and in our hair. We start the fog machine, strobe lights and music going and just trip for a while off of all that. At this point I can't decide whether I'm hot or cold, I kept fluctuating between near naked and blankets 5 deep. I can't decide whether I'm speedy or slow, happy or mad, rollin or drunk, horny or disgusted, I was in a state of mass confusion. I couldn't sit still, I was clenching my jaw, my eyes were wiggling back and forth, the music (music I normally love to roll to) was sending nasty vibrations all the way through me. R pulled out his little baggy of coke and started to separate some lines out (its 11). Now I'm never one to turn down drugs, if it's there, and it's offered to me, I will take it. I like to be on at least the same level as everyone else I'm around. At this point I would say I was past their levels. Nevertheless when it was my turn to take my lines, I snorted them with no hesitation. This is the point where my body started to tell me that maybe I had taken it too far.Never one to let people see how fucked up I am, I continued to dance, giving people light shows and shots of vicks inhaler and taking lines whenever it was my turn. I finally sat down for a min. Big mistake. I was making my way through consciousness and unconsciousness ten times in a split second, my head was nodding back and forth my eyes were wiggling back and forth fiercely. I could taste blood in my mouth and could tell them the habitus of my mouth had changed from grinding my teeth so hard. I tried to focus on getting used to the new arrangement of my teeth to keep my mind on something, as things like that usually work for me when I feel I've overdone it in some way. I was too far gone. I leaned over and confided in W that I thought I had done a bit too much and I needed to mellow out. He took me on my back porch and rolled a blunt. It was about 12:30. I hit the weed a few times and almost instantly felt myself start to even out. R, T and S came outside and W handed the blunt to them and proceeded to roll another blunt. We passed the blunt around and talked. I was way higher now than I was before, but I was high in a way that I could manage. I could handle it now. I was feeling a lot more social now than I was before and we sat on my back porch and talked and smoked weed for about an hour and a half, I can't even begin to tell you how much weed we smoked. We finally made our way back inside. W and R said they were feeling tired and needed to go to bed. I told R to sleep in the spare bedroom and W to go ahead and sleep in my bed and I'd be up in a minute. It was very dark in the house.The dark started to play tricks on me. I was hallucinating very badly, but they weren't regular hallucinations I get from an acid trip or mushrooms. These hallucinations were more like extensions of reality. Everything I saw made sense to me and even though I knew it wasn't real. I will explain to you one of the hallucinations.T had a bottle of dasani water. He put a pink glow stick in it way earlier so he knew which one was his. The bottle itself is blue. Keep in mind that it is completely dark and quiet except for a few random glow sticks. He goes to take a sip of his water and what I see is a little neon pink girl walking up blue steps, turning and laughing at me, then jumping down into T's throat. Now I knew this was not real but it made so much sense I wished it was real. These hallucinations proceeded to get more and more heinous until I gathered every bit of strength I could and stood up to turn the light on. At this point T gets up and goes to bed. So now it's just me and S. Which I really like. We compliment each other well when we are high. I babble on and on and she'll listen and add in a few words, just enough to let me know she's listening, to keep my flame burning. We sat on my living room floor and I babbled for what seemed like hours. Looking at myself it was hard to believe it was actually me I was looking at. There's no way these are my hands! They're too far away from me! I was holding onto a cup and couldn't feel the place where my hand stopped and the cup began. Essentially I felt right through the cup. I felt huge. I felt like I was part of everything and everything was part of me. I felt all important and miniscule at the same time. I finally understood the saying 'The mind is just the universe's way of looking at itself.' I could feel myself going through the ground but going through that's not a good way to explain it. I was becoming part of the ground while still maintaining my individuality. But I realized I had always been part of the ground, I just never felt it before now. I was me but I was every thing else at the same time. Really I think everything was more a part of me then I was of it. I touched S and felt like I was taking a part of her. I felt kind of guilty because she didn't know what I was doing to her so I stopped. My body started twitching involuntarily and I couldn't move my toes. I remembered then that I had told W I would be up with him in a minute. I couldn't even think of being intimate right now but I didn't want to just blow him off. Me and S went and got into my bed with W I told him we weren't in the mood right then, way too high, maybe next time though. It was 5 am now and the light was beginning to come through my window. It was throwing shadows off the bumps and lines on my spackled ceiling. If I looked at them long enough they turned into cartoons, quite funny ones actually and complex. I lay there and watched cartoons in the ceiling until I drifted off to sleep.I have tried many times to recreate an experience like this one. Never before or since have I ever been through the whole range of human emotion from a drug trip. I've even mixed all the drugs that I took that night to no avail. I've tried many times to explain how I felt sitting on my living room floor with S and I think this comes the closest to how I felt, even though it is way off. Chemicals:LSD – 1 hit 9:30 a.m.Quetiapine (generic Seroquel) 66mg 11:30 a.m.Quetiapine (generic Seroquel) 33mg 12:30 p.m.Alcohol – beer – 1 can 4:00 p.m.DISCLAIMER: I am not a pharmacologist. I know a lot about pharmacology and drugs (legal and illegal) but I do not know everything. This is all personal research done through medical journals, prescriber information books, internet resources, experience reports, personal experience and second-hand reports. Everyone is different and has different brain and body chemistry; this is simply my experience and my analysis of it. Maybe it can be helpful to you.This purpose of this report is to examine the effects (and therefore usefulness) of Seroquel (Quetiapine) as an antidote to the psychedelic effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). In theory, atypical antipsychotics such as Seroquel work directly on the effects of LSD, antagonizing the 5HT2A serotonin receptor subtype, which LSD reportedly exerts many of its psychedelic effects through. In addition, atypical antipsychotics also antagonize the D1 and D2 dopamine and H1 histamine receptors, which LSD works on, albeit to a lesser extent than 5HT. The older, more traditionally used, typical antipsychotics (e.g. the tried-and-true chlorpromazine/Thorazine, haloperidol) have very little effect on the serotonin receptor system. They do, however, exert most of their effects through the dopaminergic system, overriding the psychedelic effects of LSD but not actually removing them.Important Note: this was not the original purpose - if there was in fact a purpose at all - of the LSD experience that turned into this experience. I simply had the Seroquel in case I needed it. However, in retrospective, this actually makes for a much more interesting experience, at least in my opinion.   All this could make the newer atypical antipsychotics much more effective antidotes to psychedelics. I noticed there is not a lot of literature on this topic. I also know from personal experience and many reports that the benzodiazepines are commonly used to end LSD and other psychedelic experiences. Very early medical literature lists phenobarbital as the antidote of choice for LSD. Of course, the benzodiazepines (and the barbiturates) work on the GABA system, not the 5HT system. Although benzodiazepines, most commonly Xanax (alprazolam) and Valium (diazepam) are considered the 'standard' antidote for ending a bad experience by most circles, I think atypical antipsychotics are more effective at actually ending the experience instead of masking the symptoms of the experience.The set up included:one white-on-white LSD blotter hit, stored in a lightproof container in the freezer before consumption,one 100mg Quetiapine tablet,one trip-sitter, my roommate, experienced with various psychotropics, including LSD and mescaline,various run-of-the-mill psychedelic and trance music vinyl and mp3s at my disposal, andan entire weekend with nothing to do.The location: urban, Southern USA, mid-spring 2008, warm and sunny weatherPast drug experience: I’ve used LSD, 2C-I, DXM, diphenhydramine, salvia, various amphetamines, opiates, benzodiazepines, barbiturates, and smoked my fair share of cannabis. If that qualifies as 'experienced' or not, is in the eye of the beholder. I'll let you decide for yourself, but I think having a little background is important nonetheless.The experience:I woke up early (around 8:30, which is damn early for a Saturday) to discover that my house's Internet connection was not functioning. Realizing that without the Internet, I had nothing to do with my time, I decided to take the LSD that I had been saving for a few days after purchasing it from a 'good' source. According to reports of others who had taken this acid, it was very very smooth. I did some more research about smooth LSD, and how it could possibly be an analog of LSD-25, ALD-52. ('Sunshine Acid', anyone?) Of course, there is no way of telling what this actually was so, for simplicities sake, this is LSD-25.Note: this is not my first time taking LSD, it’s my 4th, and I've used Quetiapine as an effective antidote to dextroamphetamine (Adderall) before.After telling my roommate about this plan, the tab was dropped at 9:30 a.m., on a nearly empty stomach, save for a multivitamin and the glass of water used to wash it down. I then went and took a quick shower to relax and clear my mind as much as possible. After all, I was about to have a psychedelic experience.My roommate suggested that we watch a movie to ease me into the experience. I agreed, wanting to watch Fear and Loathing In Las Vegas, however, my roommate suggested that we watch The Doors. I had seen Fear and Loathing many times, but I had not seen The Doors before. A travesty! I know. I agreed that it would be a rather appropriate film considering the substance I had just consumed. The movie began, and the first alerts started at about 9:50, a feeling of apprehension and slight stimulation, classic LSD first alerts. By around 10:20 it was incredibly clear that I had taken LSD, very good LSD. The movie became slowed down, fragmented, and the music of The Doors along with Val Kilmer as Morrison became a psychedelic catalyst for my experience. Time dilation beginning. Time getting really slowed down. My perception of time has ceased to exist. My body load was unusually heavy but I could still handle it. Going to take a piss results in me getting lost in the bathroom for a good 20 minutes, according to my roommate. Visualizations began at around 10:30 with crawling carpeting and changes in color hues. I felt as if my head was being detached from the rest of my body. Looking outside I noticed the color of the tree outside our home was leaning closer and closer to the window. (This is no typo, that is what was happening.)This was, without a doubt, the most potent LSD I had ever taken, even though it was only one hit. As much as I would like to make a guess about the microgram dose of this blotter, I know there is no real way to tell without personally knowing the person who made it.One hour after consumption I could feel the peak coming on. Ironically, this point was where Morrison was taking large amounts of psychedelic drugs in the movie I was watching. My visuals started to be controlled by the music in the film, as well as the general mood of the movie. My roommate and I continued conversing about Morrison's philosophy and the darkness of much of his poetry and the lyrical content of The Doors' music. I thought that this would put me in a bad mindset, but this acid was different. I was able to think about depressing things and not have my trip ruined by it. By around 10:45 – 11:00, the peak is in full swing and I am melting into the floor, getting very intense, hard to see, my visual field is sideways and standing up straight becomes hard. Wow, this is really good acid. Maybe too good, I thought, this is only the beginning, time to cut this short.  At 11:30 (or thereabouts) I consumed approx. 66mg of the Quetiapine. That's a rough estimate, my roommate broke the pill into three somewhat-equal sized pieces and I took two of them.  At this point, I decided The Doors was getting to be too much, and went downstairs to listen to some vinyl.  Of course, my first inclination is to put on Pink Floyd's Dark Side of The Moon. I mean seriously, who hasn't listened to DSOTM on LSD? I’ve listened to this album on LSD before, but this was much heavier, but somehow smoother LSD. The needle dropped, my hands shaking. The body buzz was nearly overwhelming at this point, tasks requiring fine motor skills (such as setting up and playing a record on a turntable) became very difficult. I wanted to listen to 'Time'. No, I didn't. I couldn't figure out what I wanted to listen to. Things were taking way too long for me to listen to the entire album. Do I even want to listen to this album? Why isn't the Seroquel working? Then I remembered how stupid I sounded (to myself).  'You're on LSD', I said to myself, 'and you took those pills like 5 minutes ago, of course they're not working yet.'After some trouble, my roommate and I got ‘Time’ to play. My record player's needle was dirty and caused the track to skip around. I took me a little while to discern if this was happening because I was tripping or if there was simply something wrong with my turntable. So after that we decided to listen to some music on his mp3 player connected into my hi-fi system. Typical LSD musical enhancement, time changes, slows down, slight change in pitch and perception of echo effects on the vocals. After all, the song playing was 'Time', somewhat appropriate lyrical and musical content considering the distortion of time that I was experiencing while listening to the song, David Gilmour's guitar solo in the middle of the song took about 20 to 30 minutes of 'LSD time'. I was able to pick out extremely slight amounts of modulation in the distortion used in the guitar solo. That song hasn't sounded the same since. In fact, listening to it now, I can imagine being on LSD and switch my auditory perception to 'LSD mode'. A mini-flashback, maybe? Very intense, Pink Floyd never ceases to amaze me while on psychedelics.  Trance music (song of choice was DJ Dean's 'Saturday Night') was also incredibly intense, almost as if I could control the tempo control slider on a turntable with my mind. If I thought about it hard enough, I could speed up or slow down the tempo and/or pitch of the music to my liking. Although, I think this 'LSD control' was more than a simple analogy to a turntable control slider. I was able to pick apart different synth tracks in the song and change the speed and pitch of each track individually, more or less creating a different song in my head. I've never done MDMA, but damn trance sounds amazing on LSD.The stereo started to annoy me, the peak must still be going on, I thought, even though my OEVs had started to die down, maybe the Seroquel is starting to slowly work against the LSD, even during the peak? Possible, I thought. Who really knows, the acid could just be starting the long process of wearing off.My roommate then told me that he had to walk to 7-11 to buy cigarettes. So I walked with him, it was probably the longest half a mile walk of my life. I actually suggested to my roommate that he drive my car there. He insisted that this was a Very Bad Idea. I'm glad he convinced me to walk. Wow, I thought, my vision is still pretty messed up, like looking through a curved lens. Wait, didn't Hofmann write that in his report on Bicycle Day? Yes, yes he did. Wow, I thought to myself, Hofmann would be proud. 7-11 itself was rather uneventful. My thoughts were now focused on trying to tell if the Seroquel was working or not.  We made our way back to the house and things started to change. My memory, which is normally 100% functional on LSD, starts to get hazy. My visuals started to decrease substantially. Body load, still very much there, along with stimulation and the 'LSD feeling' I get in the back of my neck when I'm tripping.It is at this point, about 12:30, that I consumed the remaining Seroquel, bringing the total to 100mg. By around 1-2 pm, things were really starting to change, the antipsychotic I had taken was fighting the LSD in my head. A slight headache formed, I consumed 200mg of ibuprofen to attempt to kill it while I still could. My mental processes are getting clearer, but my thoughts are still racing. I noticed that despite my mental and visual trip being quickly beaten by the Seroquel, my body high was still running strong. Maybe the 'psychedelic' effects are mostly through 5HT2A and the other effects come from the agonism of other serotonin subtypes? I'm also getting tired and sort of hungry. I have never been hungry on LSD before.  This is actually sort of enjoyable; I'm not being forced off the LSD, but gently removed from the psychedelic part of the experience while still feeling a body high and very slight and enjoyable stimulation that I would compare to consuming about 5 mg of amphetamine.It is now about 3 in the afternoon and my second roommate (who is unaware of the fact that I'm on psychotropics) comes home. I am able to carry on a conversation with him without him even knowing that I'm on anything. We all (along with a few other friends of my roommates) decide to go down to the river. Of course, I delegate that my roommate drives his car, because, even though I'm nearly at baseline now, my pupils are still massive. After much confusion about who was actually going to the river, things got straightened out. I'm basically back to normal now, nearly no psychedelic effects at all. That's about 6 and a half hours after consumption...I should still be tripping pretty hard right about now, considering my past experiences with LSD.  We get down to the river and meet up with the other members of our group and start to walk around. Nobody is aware that I'm tripping until I tell them. If I could even call this tripping. The only thing that's different from baseline now is my body load feels sort of like I smoked some really good cannabis. The amphetamine-like stimulation is gone now too. We walk down to the water and I drink a can of beer (Pabst Blue Ribbon, no less), which has no effect whatsoever. The beer tastes just like a regular slightly warm can of PBR should. So no change in perception of taste now either. Normally when I'm on LSD, drinking fluid tastes very metallic and strange. Ahh, maybe there still is a little LSD in there after all, drinking on acid does nothing to me and I'm normally a lightweight when it comes to drinking - normally I can feel one beer. We walked back to the car and drove back home. I'm basically normal now; no mental or visual distortion whatsoever, slightly body high, although it is barely noticeable and doesn’t affect moving around or anything, and I had no problems getting back to sleep early that night (at the end of my other LSD experiences, getting to sleep was very hard).The next morning I woke up and felt refreshed, but still tired. A very good trip, I thought, certainly the best LSD I've ever taken. Taking the Seroquel really eased me out of it too.  Considering how easy and smooth it felt coming down (albeit cutting the LSD short) from the psychedelic aspect of my trip using the Seroquel, I would recommend it to anyone, at least to have as part of a psychedelic crisis kit. However, it does take a decent amount of time to kick in, which, as anyone who has taken LSD knows, is a much longer amount of time when you’re tripping. From a pharmacological standpoint, the atypical antipsychotics seem to be the direct antidote to serotonin-modulating psychedelic drugs such as LSD. Preface:  I am a very experienced drug user.  I have tried a whole spectrum of substances, and I would estimate my total trip count to be between 250-275 trips.  Including single or combined use of LSD, LSA, DMT (oral and smoked), 4-aco-dmt, Mushrooms, 25i-nbome, ketamine, DXM, 2cb, mescaline, MET, Allylescaline, DPT, and 2c-IMy mood for this trip, I was very relaxed, and joyful.  The weather was beautiful outside, and I was excited about trying a new compound.  I had eaten about 3 hours prior to dosing.  I had also had 3 beers prior to dosing as well.  Trip report:Substance report LSZ1 tabLSZ150ug3:48pm tab placed on tongue3:55pm no bitter or numbing effect similar to the 25i series.  Has a very similar taste to LSD.  Slight light headed feeling setting in[post trip comment- it set in quite quickly and in a very subtle way]3:59pm come up commencing.  Very similar to LSD.  Alert, euphoric, spacey, and dreamy [color enhancement was immediate, I also had a very strong urge to be outside]4:11pm dreamy euphoric state.  Very similar to a base LSD feel.  I feel very relaxed.  The speedy head feeling of the Phenethylamine class is absent, which confirms the compound being rooted in the ergot family.4:20pm visual distortions occurring.  Little to no body load.  I feel like closing my eyes.  It feels like I am being enticed to fall into a trance[it very much perpetuated the notion of being in a dream]4:30pm sedated dreamy feel.  Definitely shares a core physiological feel like LSD.  Seems to slowly be creeping up.  [the come up was an elongated process.  The peak didn't start until the 3rd hour into the trip]4:34pm feels like a slower version of LSD at times.  I continue feel/watch this slowly unfold5:09pm I have just returned from a nice walk.  This substance continues to slowly develop.  I like this.  A lot more than the 25x series.  I def have a heightened sense of awareness.  Minor CEV's.  Open eyed visual distortions increasing.5:29pm visuals increasing.  Still no body load.  Very relaxed, spaced out high.  Very able to function in public at this dose level.5:49pm I feel like I have plateaued in terms of effects.  I feel high, kinda tripped out.  I think this would be an excellent substance for introducing people to the psychedelic realm.  Very mellow.  Very comfortable, gradual ego loss was nice.  Music is enhanced on this.  The room is 'brighter' than normal.5:55pm this substance works in waves, just like LSD.  It definitely has the magic, connected feeling of LSD as well.  Huge spiritual potential.6:18pm I feel like it is levelling off.  It is definitely at a level to function socially.6:56pm visuals still active.  I definitely think I am still in the thick of the peak.  It's mellow.7:15pm comedown ensuing8:05pm visuals still happening.  I feel high but also feel like I am down slightly9:57pm visuals still present.  Still wide awake feeling11:53pm 6mg melatonin consumed. Oev and cev still present.  Physically tired, mentally stimulated9:30am I had a lot of trouble sleeping, I would classify it as a night of restless sleeping.  I had profound visuals within and around my 3rd eye.  Very complex imagery.  Very powerful looking faces morphing into geometric patterns.  Bright and dark color contrast.This compound definitely requires a more extended period of time.  At least 10-12 hours at the dose taken.  I tried to commence sleep eight hours into the trip.Overall, I really like this compound.  It shows enormous potential and power.  It has what the 2c series lacks, the magical and mystical component, along with the necessary ego softening/ death. I was visiting a new town to go skiing with a friend of mine. We were planning on staying with a friend of his, a girl that he had slept with last year. Of course, it turned out that her intentions were slightly different from his, and on top of that we had actually managed to make it to her house faster than she did. We were together the night before (my friend V, this girl S, and I) at a party at our college the night before. The traffic was minimal on the highway, and having lived in Germany for a year, I tend to drive speeds that I feel comfortable with, which on that day was around 90mph.So with a few hours to kill, I called a friend of mine H who I knew who was also living in the area. H was very excited to hang out and before long we had smoked several spiffs. I was quite high and because she lived with some of the chillest and intriguing, not to mention attractive girls I’ve ever met, I felt considerable anxiety. So I ran out to my car and grabbed some Tramadol. It wasn’t long before I felt the anxiety fade and the conversations flow. After a few hours we felt it was time to meet up with the group we had originally planned to meet with. I felt the Tramadol in earnest at that point, and before we got there I grabbed 6 pack of a Belgian Triple, a special kind of brew that averages 12% alcohol by volume.We arrived at my V’s friend’s place and started pregaming. The tramadol acted synergistically and I honestly felt great. I met P who was trying to dress as slutty as possible. I found this very interesting as my college is full of very conservative men and women. I continued to drink until I was blackout. P came out several time’s wearing less and less. I love the feminine figure, so this was especially pleasing. Unfortunately this is the last I remember as I blacked out.Maybe 2 hours later, I came to. I was tripping hard! What happened? I must have taken the nBome I had in my wallet. The nBome easily cut through the simple alcohol, similar to LSD and I felt pretty sober aside from tripping hard, my phone however, was completely dead. So I sought out a house with understanding people in which I could recharge my phone. Within minutes I literally felt the aura of a house. I was guided by some power it seemed.  Inside I found beautiful, enlightened people. They helped me located a charger and soon I was set with a charged phone. One person, who I would learn to call M noticed that there was something special about my affect. I admitted that I was tripping on nBome. I offered to give my new friends what was left of my 10 strip. Everyone quickly gathered around and offered me money, I felt no desire to take money and threatened to burn it if they gave it to me, however, in order for me to give it to them for free, they insisted that I take one more. I felt that it was probably a fair compromise. Soon everyone was feeling the effects and the energy was intense. I remember looking into their eyes, the eyes of people I’d never met before and understanding their entire life and soul. Their purpose for being, everything became a simple beautiful symphony. It was as if I was listened to a classical song and in a sense I understood the key and rhythm, it wasn’t hard for me to guess what notes would come next, yet they were so beautiful and powerful how they played out in reality.One girl in particular I remember being inches from her face just looking into her eyes, talking occasionally, to say wow, or how am I feeling this way? Was it love? I had never met this girl before, I knew nothing about her. As we talked and I was intrigued by the depth of her knowledge of drugs and meditation and enlightenment and beyond that, her understanding of life in general. I felt as though I could elope with this person and I honestly I felt a new path presented before me. It was like that famous Jack Frost poem. As I looked in her eyes I envisioned the possible life that lay before me.Many people began thanking me, telling me that this was exactly what they needed and that they too felt the love of the group. At one point someone suggested I go downstairs to the basement. In the basement a band was playing. The saxophonist was playing with the drums and electronics accompanying like a voice in a techno song. I felt the rich waves of the saxophone, they seemed to create a visual blanket of emotion, the way that we humans are: just at the mercy of our emotions. The musician put down his sax, and I felt a strange desire to play. I have a special relationship with the saxophone, having played my entire life, but never learning the discipline required to play in the jazz band at school. I picked up the sax and felt the energy of the beautifully tuned instrument in my hands, I felt the love and care of it’s owner and knew that this was a powerful tool. The room seemed to grow silent in anticipation.I let my breath fill the instrument and felt it cough its first words, I steadied my breath and felt my fingers roll with the rhythm of the crowd. The instrument and I fell into congress. I played up and down the scales, coming to a high note and loosing myself in a trance building the instrument up, pushing it through the harmonics that made Coltrane famous and felt the instrument slowly reach the resonance of everything I felt and wanted to communicate. The perfection I felt was unimaginable as I closed my eyes and all the colors of everything combined in a wave of energy and sound, then I let the release come and felt the room let go in an orgasm of sound. In the afterglow I slowed and let the horn go. The whole room came and gave me a hug, told me that it was incredible, that they felt it. I have not known that music had that capability.  The rest of the night kind of ended the way an anime movie ends, everyone knew there was a peak, and it was reached and now it was just a question of how to end it. Someone had some ketamine and offered spoonfuls from a pipe tamper to willing thumbs. I usually do ketamine in a line off a pocket mirror that I have. Someone grabbed my hand and curled my index finger around my thumb and pulled my hand toward the waiting spoon of ketamine. I filled my nostrils and within seconds I felt the world turn to velvet. Indeed every color turned to pastel and every texture to velvet. Everything looked soft and without definition. It was especially interesting to see the dogs that had now filled the house. Being that we were in a ski town, everyone had a dog. One dog of these dogs was a pitbull. Normally I might feel some anxiety around the dog, however, at that moment I felt perfectly calm, the dog was simply another creature on this earth. My friend N invited me to his house at this point. He looked me in the eyes and said that it was very special, as he usually never invites people he has just met to his place.  His house was a huge apartment, taking up one whole floor of a large building downtown. In some rooms were various herbs and plants growing, I noticed a few pots of cannabis and noted the flood lighting installed above. I took some time to call my girlfriend C, but as the nBome was wearing off at that point and I had drank a significant amount of alcohol at the party and at N’s apartment and done ketamine, I started to blackout again. I’m really glad that I called her, she gave me incredibly good vibes and let me feel as though the night really meant something. That is the last I remember of the night.I woke up in the passenger seat of my car, the engine running, parked where I had parked many hours earlier. I remember that it was important to sleep in the passenger seat as police would know that you weren’t driving while intoxicated. I felt great. But, I knew that a great path had been presented before me, and I hadn’t taken it, for better, or for worse.I realize now that nBome is something that will not be forgotten, and may come to define many important spiritual events in the future. I have started to refer to it as “Nadia”, and this name seems to be spreading amongst my group.

I go to the washroom and drop 1 cap of mdma and place a 400ug* tab of 25C-NBOMe under my tongue until it disintegrates then swallow it.10:30 before the opening ceremony is finished I’m getting restless standing in a circle holding hands, find I am blinking a lot11:30 we’ve gone over to the electro swing stage where the music is more upbeat and it also where the bar is. Dancing is effortless, my mood is very buoyant, able to connect with others on the dance floor around me. Feeling just supreme. Feeling very openhearted.1:00 decide I want to ramp the experience up a notch I place a 2nd 400ug blotter under my tongue until it disintegrates.1:30: The music has gotten heavier now, more a psytance vibe, the crowd has become more reptilian ,I seem to have the ability to weave in and out of a very crowded dance floor effortlessly without missing a beat. Feeling wonderful2:00am My lady friend has enough and decides to head back to the hotel room, so I drop another cap of mdma and go out on the terrace and smoke a joint of pot that has been infused with di-ethyl tryptamine. Not sure how much, but it was a big one, and usually one this size I would only smoke 1/3 and save the rest for later, but this time I kept on smoking until it is gone. The friend I was smoking with couldn’;t even smoke anymore, he passed. I start to feel a little claustrophobic stuck in conversation with a few people and escape back to the dance floor. As soon as I get to the dance floor, it hits me and the world explodes into pixeled tracers and everything goes crazy, almost like the tail end of a dmt trip when you can’t be sure if your eyes are open or closed. I’m thinking, there is no way I can navigate through the crowded dance floor, everything has gone completely haywire. But as soon as I get on the floor I decide to dance my way across, and same as before I am totally in the groove and the movements are effortless, but I am totally blown away. I am on autopilot now. I experience no anxiety though. This is heavy tripping but sooooo fine.  A buddy comes up and I am able to have a conversation with him, despite tripping out heavily, The pixelated  dmt-esque tracers persist.2:30 I head back to the main dance floor where Askhan is wrapping up his set. I find the whole crew from my city all together and join them on the floor. The music is beyond sublime. It reaches way down inside me and massages my soul to the very core of my being. I can see the music when I close my eyes. I become the music. I am in a blissed out cocoon of pure energy I am elemental now. Yet when I look around at all my friends on the floor I can totally connect with them. This state of being is no barrier to communication. This girl I’ve never met before comes up to me and throws her arms around me a gives me a huge wet kiss on the lips then another hug. She explains that my smile is soooo amazing that it makes her feel great and she is kissing me out of gratitude or how my smile makes her feel.3:30 Everywhere I look I am surrounded by smiling people. There are no cliques, every group is wide open. At the end of each song everyone on the floor is hugging and kissing one another. I’ve never been to anything like this. The room is about to explode with love. I can see my bliss reflected on so many faces and the faces where I see it we lock eyes and we know, we just know, we are connected, we are one and it is all sooo beautiful. I never want this to end.4:30 Still on the floor, but legs are beginning to ache. The peak is now over and I decide not to redose. I promised to take my lady friend for breakfast and don’t want to disappoint. Dancing is still effortless, but am making much smaller movements now, the dance is becoming more internal than external. Still connecting with folk on the dance floor, but less energetically. When I take a break, I don’t have as much to contribute to conversations. I am more into just being than relating right now.I would like to sit down in the plounge area, but the visual distortion makes it difficult to discern people from cushions so I refrain from trying to navigate a room full of people crashed out on the floor. There is no where to sit down …5:30: The visual disturbances have died down now and I go to get my coat from the coat check several times, but each time I pause and look back, only to find myself slowly beginning to dance and flowing back onto the floor. I smoke a joint but don’t really notice any change in my state.6:00 I’m ready to go, but in a strange city not knowing the taxi number or how to spell the street name where I am. Dealing with all that seems like a bigger more daunting task than it normally would. When I ask the bouncer for help he informs me there are taxis lined up outside. And sure enough when I go out there are dozens of taxis.10am I’ve been lying in bed since 6:30 but not able to sleep. So decide to get up and go for breakfast. Sure glad I am taking the train home instead of driving.7pm Back at home now, sleeeeep at long last* the 25c-NBOMe blotters was prepared by dissolving 20mgs of 25c-NBOMe in 4mls of 100% ethanol. The using an eyedropper, which dispenses 50, drops of ethanol/ml, four drops where placed on each blotter, allowing the blotters to dry between drops.  DOSE: 25 seeds oral Datura (liquid) \\xa0 1  oral Amanitas - A. muscaria (liquid) \\xa0 \\xa0  oral Alcohol (liquid)I have been growing thornapple (Datura Stramonium) for some years now in an indoor window box, where the plants grow very readily indeed. (Datura is not illegal in the UK). I collect seed each year from the over-ripe pods to replant the next, and always have plenty of plant material – including seeds – left over for experimentation. Initially I only used the material in the form of a ‘flying’ ointment applied to the skin, though I have also experimented with eating small numbers of seeds.I am the male leader of a Wiccan coven. Samhain/Halloween represents to us a time when the veil between the mundane world and the world of spirits is at its weakest, and specifically it is a time when it is possible to speak with the dead. As a reflection of this, I decided to include in our 2005 ritual the opportunity (without coercion) to drink from a ‘dark cup’, intended to bring on visions and contact with the spirits of the otherworld.The basis of the cup was a very sweet batch of Sloe Gin I had made from local sloes. To this I added a number of ingredients, of which the most relevant were a single Amanita Muscaria (fly agaric) mushroom which I had picked and a handful of thornapple seeds, perhaps 25-30 in all. These additional ingredients were steeped in the gin for almost a month, with occasional agitation, before being filtered out and discarded. The total volume of gin was about one pint.The ‘dark cup’ was offered to seven persons, including myself, all of whom drank from it, to the extent that the total amount available was consumed. I took only a token sip, the others drank more freely to varying degrees. All were aware (in general terms) of the content of the cup.I summarise below the effects on the seven:Myself – no discernable effect.After about 45 minutes, G, a female in her twenties who has recently lost weight to about 125lb reported very dry mouth, faintness and a feeling of spaciness/unwellness. At her request, she was escorted back to her hotel room. She was barely able to stand at this stage, and needed assistance to her room as though she was very drunk. Her stated intent was to settle down for the night, as she had an early bus to catch in the morning, and she was left on that basis.I next spoke to G by phone in the morning. She had had a very disturbed night, poor sleep, and had been sick on at least one occasion. She had also picked up a bruise on the side of her head, though she had no recollection of how this occurred. Nonetheless, she succeeded in catching the bus home – a six hour bus journey.G phoned me again in the evening to ask if others had been having the same problem she now had, i.e. blindness. A few questions clarified that this was not total blindness, merely pupil dilation leading to an inability to read close-up material (such as the computer screen). My knowledge of thornapple use allowed me to reassure her that this would pass, though potentially it could be some days before it did so. During the call she mentioned that during her bus journey home, she had spent a good portion of the journey talking with the guy sat next to her, and it was only late in the journey that it became apparent to her that she was hallucinating and that there was no-one sat next to her. Apparently she got some very funny looks from the other passengers.By the following day G’s symptoms had diminished to the extent that she was able to return to her job without significant interference.P, a man in his late twenties, experienced dry throat symptoms during the ritual, and became tired, so that he did not stay to the end of the socialising after the ritual, but went upstairs to bed. During the night he spent much of the time wandering around corridors, bumping into walls which he claims he was unable to see. He had a number of hallucinations of people in various rooms who he saw as real until he touched them and they disappeared. This included, in one case, a couple of people looking through his bag, something which he jealously guards.By the morning, P’s symptoms had largely subsided and he appeared his normal self.D, a woman in her forties who is the female leader of the coven, experienced dry mouth, lack of ability to taste food, and a pleasant spacey feeling, but no more significant effects. All effects were gone by the morning.The remaining three attendees have not reported in detail their experiences, although by implication these were probably at the milder end of the spectrum.The loss of ability to taste identified by D appears to have been fairly general, in that a substantial post-ritual meal remained essentially untouched, other than by myself. MINDSET: Ready, willing, happy, but with a little touch of anxietySETTING: Camping with friends on a beach on a warm summer eveningDOSE: 20mg weighed on 0.001g scalesPAST EXPERIENCE: 2CB, 2CI, 4-HO-MIPT, 4-HO-MET, MDMA, MDA, Shrooms, LSDLet me start by saying that tripping for me is often a social experience, rather than a spiritual journey. I feel already feel happy, sane, and like I really understand myself, so I use psychedelics mainly for fun. However, sometimes they take me by surprise, and give me a deeper insight into life when I'm not expecting it. This night would be one such experience. We set up camp in a secluded beach on a warm summer evening. Waves gently lapped, the air was warm yet fresh, the sky was clear, and a meteor shower meant we knew we were in for some shooting stars. It felt like a perfect evening.20:00 - I swallowed the 4-HO-MET. 20:15 - We moved our air beds underneath an overhang on the cliffside, a little way back from the water (we didn't know how high the tide would get, so played safe). We had a great view of the bay and night sky.21:00 - First effects. I felt a gentle wave of euphoria rush over me and feel the familiar energy that says 'you're about to have an interesting time'. 21:30 - It's very dark, so We light a small fire. The orange glow gently lights our surroundings. I look up at the cliff ledge above our heads. The rocks appear to twist and contort into bodies and faces, almost aztec in nature, the entire thing looks sculpted and is ever changing. I am astonished by the intricacy. I lay open mouthed and laugh at the beauty of it.22:00 - I start to see gentle, detailed, small wireframe fractals, of many colours, they cling to the edges of objects, dancing around them playfully. They are incredibly pretty, and although subtle are easy to see and a joy to watch. The sound of the waves becomes somehow more digital and sparkling, rushing through me in a most pleasurable way.22:15 - I can converse easily, although it's harder to vocalise my thoughts than usual. It's very easy to laugh, and see the funny side of things. 22:30 - A hint of paranoia. A small rock falls from the cliff. I think about the weight above us and consider moving out into the beach away from the cliff edge. This preoccupies me for perhaps 5-10 minutes, before I decide that the chances of a landslide are very small. I'll take my chances. It's very easy to push negative/paranoid thoughts out of my head, even though I'm a solid +++ by now. 23:00- I decide I need a piss. I get up and move away from our campfire. As I move further into the darkness I am careful where I tread, and urinate around the corner out of sight of the fire. It's almost pitch black. At this point, I look up. And when I do, I am astonished - my jaw drops and I say out loud: 'oh my GOD' - the night sky looks incredible. I am blown away.I live in the city, so seeing a clear night sky in a dark location is always a treat. But this was something else. I was speechless. It was almost painfully beautiful. I stared up at the stars for a long time, as they shimmered and glowed. The stars were joined up by these kind of 'energy lines', it seemed like a huge cosmic grid. Astonishing and awe inspiring. I was knocked back by the beauty of the universe. Waves of euphoria rushed through me. I felt utterly connected with the cosmos, in my own small way. It was one of the most profound experiences of my life.00:00 - I rejoin my friends. I can feel it's wearing off now, but I still enjoy the aztec patterns in the rocks. Conversation is easy and fun.01:00 - Almost back to baseline. I have a few beers.02:00 - Sleep09:00 - Wake up in the morning feeling great.Summary: 4-HO-MET is sometimes knocked for being an 'easy' or 'light' psychedelic. This is unfair. It's true that it's easy on the body and mind, but it can produce the most stunningly beautiful visuals, incredible euphoria, immense laughter, but also offer real insight and incredible appreciation of the world. It's also reasonably easy to socialise with on low to moderate doses, and the short duration of action is a bonus if you don't want to be up all night. I have used 4-HO-MET upward of 20 times, and every time has been wonderful. having heard for-ages the legend of 'drinking alcohol rectally' and then reading about amy winehouse snorting a shot of vodka and not-dying... i decided to finally try alcohol rectally yesterday.from searching online most postings recommended using a standard enema applicator and mixing warm/body-temp water in a 1-to-ratio with any burgundy/red wine (which is 20 to 30 proof).  I hate wine... but I love bombay sapphire (which is 94-proof)... since i am heavier than most people (6'3' and 270lbs) I felt confident i could handle more alcohol than the standard dose.The enema applicator holds 6oz of fluid (it looks like a turkey baster with a very thin 3'-long nozzle.  i heated tapwater to 99-degrees and checked it with a digital thermometer to not-burn myself.  I poured a 1oz shot of bombay sapphire into a true-lined 1oz shotglass (NOT 1.5 like many are) and sucked it up into the enema applicator.  i then squeezed-out the air i also sucked up and sucked-the remaining 5oz of water.  i put a small portion of Wett Platinum lube on my anus and completely-lubed the 3' tube applicator.  it slid-in very easily with no pain at all.  I squeezed the plunger and got the full 6oz of liquid in my ass.t+0 OH MY GOD IT BURNS!

DOSE: \\xa0 repeated oral Alcohol             BODY WEIGHT:   121 lb         On August 20th, 2010, my mother collapsed and stopped breathing.  Her boyfriend called 911, and then my dad at work.  My dad called me at 730am to tell me what had happened.  I had just gotten back from sleeping in my car all night after a fight with my husband.My mother was an alcoholic.  So was her boyfriend.  My first reaction was that it was more of her 'drama' and that she probably fell down drunk, or had a seizure and that she was fine.  I dropped my son off at school and then headed over to the mobile home park she had recently moved into.  As I turned into the park, my stomach began to swim.  I suddenly had a bad feeling.  The paramedics were standing outside of her mobile home.  She was either fine or dead.  I had a sick feeling that she was gone.I walked up to the paramedics, who looked pale and apprehensive as this 7 month pregnant woman was approaching them, crying.  I asked if she was gone, and they nodded.  I walked in and saw her body on the floor by the foot of her bed, she was covered with a bloody sheet, and I refused to look under it.  The cause of death was acute liver failure, due to excessive drinking.  She was 48 years old.  She never got to see my son who was born 2 months after her death.  I did get the chance to say I loved her two nights before, but it preceded a bad fight about 'getting her life together.'My drinking was also out of control.  When I got pregnant this time, I swore I wouldn't let it get as bad as it was again.  Unfortunately I would break down occasionally and guzzle 2 or 3 beers once a week while pregnant.  My relationship with my husband was and still is a nightmare, and we had to move back into my father's home with my brother, which resulted in constant fighting between everyone.I strayed from drinking heavily for a few weeks, but it quickly caught up with me.  My home situation was and still is wearing on me.  It's been 18 months and I drink enough some nights that I black out, and not be able to do anything the next day.  My son missed school today because I just couldn't get out of bed.  And here I am, drinking some more.  I haven't gone a day without a drink in about two weeks.  Some nights I drink four or five beers, some nights I drink ten.  I am so tired.  I LOVE to drink.  It relieves my anxiety, it gets me to sleep, it makes me want to be social and to enjoy things.  My drug of choice is hydrocodone, and I actually drink much less when I take it, but I only get so much a month, and the other days I have to fend for myself.  I just don't see an end to this, and I cannot believe I would let alcohol take over my life, as it destroyed my childhood and robbed me of my mom.  It's a sad story.  Alcohol is not evil, but people need to understand the power of drugs and to respect it.  It can sneak up on you, trust me.----------------------------------------February 2013 AddendumA Nightmare That ContinuesI am updating my report written almost one year ago about my alcohol addiction. I had forgotten I had written it, probably because I was high on xanax and drunk. I had my third son, this past November. I cut down on my drinking, but did not stop while I was pregnant. I allowed myself only 2 beers a night, except for six different occasions when it was 3. 1/3 of the nights I did not drink at all. My son was born healthy and happy. He hasn't had any problems thus far, thank god. Obviously I still have a problem, though. It took a couple weeks, but I am back to my usual drinking habits.  I am back to my usual drinking habits. I think it may even be worse. The funny thing is, is that I don't really even like drinking. When I take hydrocodone (my drug of choice) I hardly drink at all. I wish I could take that all the time, instead of drinking. I also take sertaline (Zoloft) everyday and xanax when the anxiety is unbearable. I know that if I don't stop drinking or cut down it will shorten my lifespan. How can I keep doing something even though I know it is, and will kill me? Like I said, I don't even enjoy being drunk all that much. To me, it feels chaotic and overly emotional. The reason I think I drink is that it tends to my boredom and anxiety. It's what I look forward to every day. I just focus on getting through the day until I can drink at night, which has been the story of my life. I hate it, and yet I still drink. I wake up every morning with fear, guilt, and just being plain sick from a hangover. Every day. I know that only I can stop my drinking, and I plan to attend AA meetings to help. My advice is to be careful. I have 3 children, and I will tell them about our family history of alcoholism and how it took my mother's life. And then I need to get help myself. I was already in a jolly mood, having resently moved a bit further away  from the hectic life in the city to a small village, and had come to town for a party that was held in a commune that's a local legend for it's parties. I had been smoking my bong since waking up, and was already quite buzzed waiting for my friend who was to accompiany me for the party. On the phone he'd mentioned he'd gotten us something a bit more special, but since such things aren't talked straightly about on the phone, I had no idea what it'd be. LSD? Speed? In my spare time waiting I also drank a 75 cl bottle of 10% white wine and had a few hits from my ½ l bottle of Jack Daniels.He finally arrived around nine, and indeed it was something special, since I consider all new experiences as special. I had never tried Bromo-Dragonfly since I had no trustworthy supplier, but since I've shared the last ten years of my life with the guy, in a sense, he is one of the few people around I know who've taken a wider range of substances than even I have, and I had my RC days...It was just like your basic paper, the other side looked like it could be from a carddeck, and the other was white with a small clear print of BDF. 500 mics he said, and I believe it. Knowing the onset could take frustratingly long, we spent another hour smoking and rolling joints for the party.When we got there, it was on. In under thirty minutes we were already offered cannabiscakes, the mood there was lively and we ended up immediately sitting in the kitchen, the heart of a houses social life. Since atleast half of the people there were either my friends or their friends, neither of us felt any unnesessary fears or such, we blended in just fine.Since we'd taken the BDF three hours earlier, and I already had the sensation I have with acid rising that 'somethings coming', I took my friend upstairs, where the middle room at the top of the stairs is colourful in many ways, in lighting, in decoration, set up as a lounge to lay around in. A great place if you're expecting something visual. And it all went well, when it finally hit me I don't know if it was BDF or the alcohol, but I did have some short blackouts, some of wich I've remembered later on. But the loss of ego in a sense, that was wonderfull, I gave two girls the massage of their lifes, played drums with people, in one of the bedrooms there was a bit of a rave going on. And since it's Finland, a party ain't a real party without a sauna that's on all the time. It's almost impossible to precisely describe how the heat and steam felt, expect that they were wonderfull aswell. Everything was. The steam took colours when I wanted it to, I was very in control.Afterwards I left the party at an unknown time, and headed to a place I'd arranged for myself to sleep in, but sleep ofcourse, was no option. I kept slowly drinking beer and smoking alone the entire night, feeling, pondering. I think after the actual onset around 1 AM the actual rising of it took like 12 hours or so. The visuals were truly great, so flexible and somehow controllable.     The day I spent meeting friends and doing the prementioned, until I took a bus home, fell asleep around eight only to wake up at midnight to still a very jolly mood, restarted drinking with my roommate for a few more hours and finally crashed to real sleep after taking double of my normal 2 mg rivotril and a few valium.Needless to say, the aftereffects are possibly the longest I've ever had. The next day I woke just in time to rush to my first meeting with the local social worker, and If I wasn't experienced with psychedelics, I think the meeting could have been akward, since her face kept flushing and I occasionally heard 8-bit Nintendo-like soundeffects out of nowhere. But in my case, the meeting went well. Later that day I had no more visual effects, but the occasional odd sound still came once in a while.In retrospective, for me it was great, and I already eagerly wait to try it in privacy without the booze, in a very different sort of place and setting. It's just so long lasting, I'd recommend anyone thinking of trying it to do so on a friday, if they're in school or work or something like that... This experience was a huge wake up call for me.  I hope all of you who read this can learn from my near fatal mistake.  My friends and I like to go out to dance clubs and occasionally take drugs.  While my friends and I were making plans for the night I asked them all if they were going to be getting any drugs.   Everyone said they were all just going to drink, so I figured it would be a night of alcohol only.  Fine with me. Since I was short on cash, I decided I would get a cheaper start to the night and drink before I got to the club downtown to avoid the expensive prices.  I had 2 glasses while I was getting ready and split one more cup with a friend in the car on the way down there. (I know...not smart) I wasn't driving and I was with 2 of my girlfriends, my boyfriend and his best friend all in the same car.  About 11:00pm  which was an hour after we had arrived, my boyfriend and his best friend approached me and said for me to follow then to the unisex bathrooms.  I thought, 'Alright...they have drugs'  And sure enough they pulled out a small bottle of GHB.  I only had one vodka and redbull and was nursing a cape cod so I thought, why not?  We all took a small capfull and went out to dance.  For the next 30 minutes or so I had a great time.  I was dancing and I could tell I was really out of it.  I was dizzy and  lightheaded, but I had taken GHB before so I was expecting it.  But that's when everything changed.  I have no memory of what happened next AT ALL.  The only reason I can tell you this is because I was with several friends who saw everything.  Apparently, after I'd been out on the dance floor I went to the bathroom again around midnight with one of my girlfriends and took another capfull and she took one.  I then waited for her to use the bathroom and when she was finished I grabbed her and started kissing her. (I am in a serious committed relationship with my boyfriend of a year.  I love him with all my heart, so this was not normal for me.)After we stopped kissing in the stall, we went back out to the dance floor with everyone else.  I'm still fuzzy on the details because I've gotten mixed stories from different friends but some say I went to the bar and they were buying all of us shots. (Of what, I have no idea)  However, a few friends told me that I wasn't taking any shots with them, I was just leaning against the railing while they were taking them...who knows.After that I was told I was dancing for a while longer and then I was leaning over the rail around the dance floor.  My boyfriend said he began to scratch my back slowly asking if I was ok.  He said, I stood up and looked at him with my eyes rolling back in my head and just stared at him blankly.  He assumed I was fine...just messed up on GHB and began dancing only to turn around immediately after that and see me and his best friend kissing and leaning against the railing.  THIS is totally unnatural for me.  I am in no way interested in his best friend...I would NEVER have done that.  My boyfriend got angry and went upstairs and about 15 minutes later one of our other friends came up to get him and told him I was passed out outside and coughing up blood.  He said (still pretty mad) 'How can she be passed out AND coughing up blood?'  And our friend told him it was serious and he really needed to get down there.  I still don't know if I was really coughing up blood...some say I was and some say I wasn't. (???)  He went outside and I was already strapped in an ambulance with a 16 gauge IV in my arm, oxygen mask on, and totally unconscious. This all happened right at 1 am. (Just 15 to 20 minutes before I was kissing his best friend on the dance floor...??)  My boyfriend went with me to the hospital in the ambulance and I almost flatlined on the way. Luckily they were able to flush enough fluids into me and get oxygen into my lungs and I am fine, but imagine how scared and shocked I was when I woke up 4 hours later in a hospital room strapped down with an IV and people asking me if I knew where I was.  At first I was telling them I was at the club.  I thought, what a crazy question...of course I know where I am...but I couldn't figure it out.  I had taken two capfulls of GHB in two hours before and had a great time.  I have even taken two capfulls along with a few drinks and been fine.  It was just that either this GHB was stronger or maybe I had too much alcohol.  There is really no way to determine a safe combination of the two.  Regardless...it was an almost deadly combination.  I will never take GHB again.  Not only because it's dangerous but because of the things I did while on it that I NEVER would have done under ANY other circumstances. After it was all over I was very tired and dehydrated.  I was severely depressed for two days and didn't want to return any of my friends phone calls or see anyone.  I was sick to my stomach.  My boyfriend forgave me but I felt horrible when I was told what I'd done...although I don't remember one second of kissing either of them, and I have a HUGE hospital bill I'm still paying on. BUT the worst part was the soreness in my legs and back, and bruising all over my back and elbows.  I could hardly sit, lie down, or walk up the stairs and was in pain for a couple of weeks.  I later found out that the club bouncers had carried me outside and dropped me on my back on the concrete, unconscious.  This explained some of the soreness and extreme bruising on my back.  And in the few days following that night I began to have flashes of things that may or may not have happened that night.  One flash that occurred to me while I was almost asleep one night was of me leaning backwards over the railing, someone leaning on top of me, and the railing digging into my back.  I don't know if this was something that happened or if I was just staring to dream.  I guess I'll never know the full details of the night I almost died. I recently went on Wellbutrin XL, 150 mg once daily, for the treatment of severe depression. I have never been a heavy drug user, and I had intended to avoid drugs or excessive alcohol for the duration of my antidepressant therapy. However, I had just moved into a new apartment and decided to celebrate by going out to a bar and having a few drinks. On Wellbutrin, I feel the effects of alcohol almost immediately, and I require fewer drinks than usual to obtain the perfect buzz. By one a.m., I was mildly intoxicated and ready to head home while my roommate and friends continued to drink. I walked home with a friend who is a heavy marijuana user, and we shared a good-sized joint together. My experiences with weed up to that point had been generally pleasant and innocuous, free from bad trips or paranoia. Usually, I just experienced muffled thoughts and sedation. That night, after one puff, I felt the characteristic body high begin to creep up, and with a second hit, I was immediately struck by the feeling of losing complete control of my body. I became terrified as I could barely control my movements. I (foolishly) hurried my friend away because I wanted to climb into bed alone and wait for the feeling to subside. I was confused because the amount of weed I had smoked was barely enough to become high, let alone enough to have such a strong negative reaction or overdose symptoms. I began to experience the sensation of strong electric shocks running from the top of my head down through my arms. I was afraid that I was going to have a seizure. I began to have heart palpitations, and I was shaking uncontrollably. In my paranoid state, I was convinced that I was going to die, alone in my room, due to a tiny amount of weed. After lying on the floor for an hour, the symptoms had not subsided, instead they became more intense, with the electrical sensations moving throughout my body. I called my roommate and asked her to take me to the emergency room. When she arrived, I was convinced that my body temperature was much too low, causing my teeth to chatter, but to her I felt feverish. I was able to walk, but I couldn't control my tremors and I couldn't think clearly. My roommates told the nurses that I had taken something and they weren't sure what it was. I didn't even think to mention the fact that I was on an antidepressant. I can barely remember the waiting room, but I was eventually turned away because I don't have Canadian health insurance. I didn't have 500 dollars to pay the admittance fee, and I was taken home. Without being able to do anything but lie down and hope for the feelings to subside, I fell asleep, shaking and scared. I thought that I wasn't going to wake up in the morning. I did wake up, feeling as thought I had a terrible hangover, but nothing worse. I talked to the friend that had given me the weed, and he had experienced nothing similar, which meant that it could not have been laced. I haven't smoked anything since that night, and alcohol alone has not caused any similar symptoms. My first experience with somas was definately a positive one. Prior to this experience I'd had my fair share of other psychoactives; MJ, Mushrooms, DXM (never again!), and various prescription pain killers. So without further adue....About a year or so ago a couple of friends and I were headed to another friends house for a small party/kickback.  Upon arrival much MJ and beer was passed around and everybody got a nice buzz going.  I chose only to partake in the beer as I was being randomly drug tested for MJ at the time. Probably around 2 hours later (and 6 or 7 beers later) while chillin in the garage having a pool tournament, a friend of mine busted out a big bag of white pills.  After inquiring about the ingredients I was told they were '350mg American Somas', supposedly the 'good' kind, as compared to Mexican somas. I’m guessing the American version is just a purer form. Anyways after some serious coaxing I was able to talk my friend into giving me 3 of the pills.  She said 'if you’ve already downed a lot of beer, I would wait on these...its gonna be intense.'  Interesting.  Disregarding her warning (stupid, I know) I downed all three with a swig of beer and decided I would kill it on the alcohol for the rest of the night and just kick back and let these babies do there thing.Maybe 30 mins later I was having SEVERE trouble seeing straight.  Double vision merging into triple vision would, I guess, be the best way to describe it.  I was also feeling really...well...goooooooood.  I’d had experience with a number of different pain killers before this, but none quite compared to what I was feeling now.10 mins after that and I was all but immobal.  It was almost as if I had grown roots into the couch I was sitting on and had no intentions of getting up.  My buzz at this point was, in a word, INCREDIBLE.  Like nothing I’ve ever experienced.  I was so relaxed and one with everything, very similar to effects I’ve noticed after coming down off of a strong mushroom trip.  Wierd I know, as I’ve never experienced this feeling with any painkiller.  I also had almost no motor skills.  Movement was a chore, although moving my mouth and forming the syllables to make words was still a fairly easy task...formulating thoughts to provoke speech was not.  A small amount of nausea was in the back of my stomach throughout most of the experience but more often then not I would start thinking about something and forget about the nausea.I couldn’t give you an exact time frame but for around the next hour and a half I sat in the same position on that couch.  Occasionally talking to a friend that passed by or had a seat next to me.  Also I do remember having a hard time remembering the extreme short term.  For example I would take out a ciggarette, and then, before lighting it, think of something else and forget about the ciggarette.  Then, once I remembered the cigg, I had no clue what I had done with it even though only 20 or so seconds had passed since removing it from the pack (most of the time it was sitting in my lap or on the ground near me, as if I had just let go of the cigg once another thought crossed my mind).It was now around 12:30 and the experience was nearing the end of its peak so I decided to try and take a walk....The friend I had gotten the somas from, whom I will now refer to as M, was also very intoxicated off of a soma/alcohol mixture.  After some work I managed to remove my ass from the couch and find M.  I asked her if she would like to take a walk with me and she happily agreed.  So off we went to a school down the street so we could sit it the grass and look at the stars.  Almost as soon as we arrived at the school M said she felt very sick.  Concerned, I asked her how much she had drank and how many pills she had taken, although I don’t know exactly how understandable my speech was at this point.  Her reply was 3 beers, 5 somas.  M then proceeded to violently vomit for 10 mins and I became very frightened that she might have taken too many. Yet as she finished vomiting she said she suddenly felt great, and she said that sometimes that happens to her on somas.  I don’t know if this is a regular occurance for some people after the injestion of Carisoprodol but apparently it was for M.  Still concerned I took her back to the party and put her to bed, while her friend, and owner of the house, watched over her for the rest of the night.Nearing the 2 O'clock hour I decided it time to go and my friends agreed.  We found our DD (hitting a bong no less, hey, u can’t win them all) and home it was.  I hit my bed and immediately fell into a deep, very vivid dream filled sleep until 4PM the following day (Boss wasn’t to happy about that one).So all in all what can I say about my first experience with somas? Amazing, great, and most importantly..STUPID.  I usually research anything I take extensively before taking the drug.  I knew a fair amount about pills, and I knew that mixing beer and pills is a bad idea...but I didn’t know it was an especially bad idea with Carisoprodol.  Don’t get me wrong, somas are great and I have since become a recreational user - I.E. When I can find them - but I went about doing them for the first time the wrong way, and I hope that people can gain some helpful knowledge from what I’ve wrote here today. What I‘m about to tell is a bit embarrassing, considering the fact that I’m a grown woman and should have known better. Anyway, here’s my story:I had found out about tripping on motion sickness pills by pure chance while browsing the web, and I was rather intrigued. I have never done any drugs besides alcohol, but I was fascinated by some of the experiences I read. So I went and bought some motion sickness pills that run under the brand name Vomex here in Germany, each pill containing 50 mg Dimenhydrinate. Mind you, I wasn’t after a full blown trip, I just wanted to test the waters, so to speak. Recently I have had trouble sleeping, and I figured at worst the pills would help me with that.So last Friday evening I changed into my PJs and settled comfortably on my bed with my netbook. I had decided that I would keep a log describing my experience. Being the careful person that I am (you’ll understand the irony of this later), I took one pill at 20:15pm to observe the way I’d react. Nothing happened. So an hour later I took two more pills. I thought I felt something then, but it was very weak and didn’t make me tired at all. In the opposite, I just got all shaky and my pulse went up.I waited until 21.30pm to take another two pills. Half an hour later, I still hadn’t noticed any effect. It was then that I made a rather stupid decision. I remembered that in the past I had once or twice taken Vomex against nausea after drinking too much, and I had always been out like a light half an hour later. So, in order to boost the effect of the pills, I poured myself a rather generous amount of gin and downed it in one go.By now it was about 23:00pm and I started to feel somewhat lightheaded, which I attributed mainly to the alcohol. The trembling from before had subsided and gradually I became more relaxed. But still no drowsiness.At 23:45pm I resolved to have another drink. About fifteen minutes later I was beginning to feel really drunk. I was seeing double by now and typing was becoming difficult. I was watching anime on my computer and noticed that following the story was getting rather tough. In retrospect, I guess I had reached the point at which the pills finally started to kick in, but at that time I blamed all of it merely on the alcohol. So of course at 12:30am I decided I would have another two pills. Now imagine my surprise when I noticed that not five but seven pills were already missing from the pack! I had apparently taken two more and forgotten about it. That should have been a warning sign, but at that point I was too far gone to care. So I told myself I’d simply take one more, bringing me up to a dose of 400 mg. I figured that should be safe enough, since it was the recommended maximum dose per day.By now my motor skills were deteriorating rapidly. When I had to go to the bathroom, my balance was severely off and I would have to hold onto walls and doors. Even sitting down on my bed, I couldn’t help swaying back and forth. I started to make a lot of typos in my entries, but at the same time I was enjoying myself immensely. That was when things started to get hazy.My log states that at about 1:00am I had my third drink, washing down the ninth pill, thus bringing me up to 450 mg. Unfortunately I have no recollection of doing this or of the hours that followed.I woke up in my bed at 10:20am. The computer was still running. It seems I stopped watching anime at some point, probably because I had no idea what was going on. I checked the browser’s history and found that I apparently had been browsing the web, though I can’t think why I would have been interested in some of those sites. For example I went to a website constructing anagrams, where I typed in some random letters. I was rather worried I might have engaged in “Drunk Mailing”, so I checked my email, too, but luckily there was nothing in the “Sent” folder. I guess I was too far gone to manage typing in the password, anyway. Another weird thing is that I apparently got up to get a sweater out of my wardrobe. I woke up having it wrapped around my shoulders, though I have absolutely no memory doing this. Also, I think I might have had another drink. The bottle of gin was half empty.Judging by my log I started to get seriously confused after 1.00am, as in the next entries I was already unable to give the correct time. The entries I made also become virtually unreadable pretty soon. Here’s an example:Just went to the bathroom. Well, staggg34 2ould b3 the corrxt te3rm. it#s rather cruytrating –b oops, again I’ve forgotten wasw NBPOUT TO SEE:The last entries are nothing but complete gibberish, random letters strung together. I made the last entry at 3.30am. (For some reasons I saved it in a separate file, so I was able to check the time.)When I now read my log, it’s really funny how I’m complaining about not feeling a thing for three hours, and then, WHAM, it hit me full force. Obviously I underestimated the stuff. I checked the facts online again and only then became aware that a trip with Dimenhydrinate will need some time to built up. In retrospect, the alcohol has been a mistake since it kept me from noticing the onset of the trip while also enhancing the effects of the drug. Since I took 450 mg, I might even have been hallucinating, but I have no idea if I actually did. I’m a bit annoyed that I can’t remember being so messed up, but at the same time I’m impressed.The next day the effects of the drug were still pretty noticeable. My head and legs felt heavy and my balance was still slightly off. Now and then I would have small muscle spasms like the ones you get shortly before falling asleep. Also my hands were rather shaky. I was rather glad that I had at least had the foresight to choose a Friday evening for my little adventure, so I was able to spent most of the next day in bed.Now, what did I learn from this?1. Mixing alcohol and Dimenhydrinate is not a good idea.2. Be patient and don’t redose, especially when already far from sober.3. Make sure I have nothing on my hands for the next day.I’m quite aware that things could have gotten nasty. I’m glad I didn’t do something stupid during my black-out, like falling asleep with a burning cigarette or taking any more pills. Overall I wouldn’t call it an unpleasant experience, though. I was feeling rather good the whole time (at least during the span of time I can actually remember), and found the hangover symptoms easy to deal with. I will definitely give the Dimenhydrinate another try sometime. Timothy Leary would slap me in the face if he heard this abortion of set and setting for my first entrance into psychedelia.Set: I just started dating a girl and was pretty anxious about where it was going, I've always been scared of psychedelics and didn't do anything to calm my nerves prior to the trip, I'd recently been getting more pronounced paranoia from pot usage, I occasionally have anxiety episodes for no obvious reason, earlier my friend and I were having a conversation where I was arguing that humans only exist to further the cause of entropy.Setting: 3:00am after a night of drinking, at my friend's tiny, institutional place, which is foreign to me and uninviting, it's freezing cold out and I'm in an unfamiliar city, we have no chill music on hand, I'd never even heard of hbw.Prior drug use: plenty of pot and alcohol, one DXM experience (roboitchin'), one cool nyquil/pot/alcohol synergy, one nitrous hit.So my friend suddenly pulls out this bag of 'legal drugs' he's collected. I'm somewhat drunk and more than a little impressed with the mound of weird plants and seeds. He didn't have any pot and I'd been in the mood for something besides booze. So when he proposed that we dip into the supply, I was intrigued. He showed me the hbw and said it was what he wanted to do (he'd done it before and wanted to give it another shot). I'd always wanted to trip, but never had the balls. Alcohol grew me a pair that day. After debating, we each grabbed about 5 seeds (low dose, I know, but I'm a small guy and was uninitiated). We did nothing to prepare, just chomped away and began the wait. At this point I noticed my friend had a guitar. I figured wailing away for a while would be a good prep for the trip and that's just what I did. For about 45min-hour I slammed the strings, more frantically every minute, yelled things, knocked things over and eventually as the drug kicked in, started biting random objects and shouting heartfelt pleas for my friend to bang out a beat. Most of the playing was normal for me, especially infused with alcohol, but towards the end of the hour I began feeling a surge of energy that had nothing to do with booze.As the trip began, I was immediately relieved. It felt strange like nothing before ever had, but it wasn't at all disturbing. In fact, I soon found in addition to the weird energy, there was an intense euphoria coming on. For about 30min-hour I babbled nonstop about how great the drug felt, how I never should have been afraid, etc. I then got an intense urge to share my mind with my friend. I wanted him to understand everything I ever knew and all my feeling. I especially wanted to talk about places we've been together and how our perspectives were different. I talked about all kinds of things, including the negative aspects of life, but nothing bummed me out. I was ecstatic to be sharing and to view all my problems as insignificant and solvable. At this point, I figured I had reached the peak and was about to come down.Then things got intense. First I went into a sort of meditation where I would feel on the edge of something: falling asleep, waking up, dying, enlightenment, god knows, but I'd flinch and lose it at the last second. Then I snapped. I lost complete touch with reality. There was no hallucination. Everything around me was still there, but it was no longer real. I knew I was on a drug, but somehow that didn't explain enough. While I had no insight into the real nature of life, I did know that I could no longer continue with whatever this illusion is. For a while it was amazing. Until terror struck and I bolted into the cold night without shoes, socks or a jacket.It took quite an effort to get me back inside. My mind alternated between viewing the apartment as safety or hell. Somehow between my running, 911 dialing and confused rambling my friend managed to give me the impression that his apartment was not confining me to the fucked up existence I'd known previously. During the walk back, I felt a clarity, a stillness, a loneliness I've experienced on more than one sober occasion since. It is beautiful and frightening and may be what I believed it to be. The rest was classic bad trip. I was already dead or in the process of dying, I was forever insane, I was in the womb waiting for rebirth, I was at my parents' house hallucinating and could hear their voices vaguely through the madness, the tv discussed my death (actually saddam hussein's), my friend alternated between demon (complete with melting eyes) and angel. Meanwhile nausea struck causing me to spit constantly, triggering visions of 'actual reality', a car accident and me on the side of the road spitting blood. My friend vomited, but was exceedingly calm considering my condition. The only positive aspect of this part of the trip was the intense closed eye patterns I saw. I knew if I could just get some sleep, I'd feel better, but it wouldn't come.The next day the comedown was in waves. Sober, then slightly tripping, then paranoia. I paced the city and moved with the flux. Eventually I felt relaxed enough to sleep. That was around 8:00pm. The drug itself had worn off by 2pm or so (about 11 hours after ingestion). Scattered memories: spitting out a large gulp of water I deemed poisoned, becoming a puddle of piss as I pissed, glowing textile patterns, realizing my friend and I had murdered the neighbor [no, not actually of course], visions of my aunt's house, trip dialing and leaving an extended message, pillow humping.Don't take this as a condemnation of hbw. The drug packs a powerful head trip as advertised. Just be ready for it and plan properly. I've been prescribed Quetiapine for some time now, starting back in last year for anxiety and to aid sleeping. I recognized immediately the potential of this drug, Seroquel. Not much seems to be known by the public of this chemical, and even the recreational community is hit or miss pertaining to whether they've heard of it. There were not many reports of it, and the reports that had gotten through raised opposition to how I viewed it myself. To start off, many people swear by its inability to be used recreationally, and yet those who have used it in that manner pertest to its overwhelming effects and inability to be mixed. I have taken many things while on my daily dose, or more, and I feel it can be mixed quite safely with some things, while not so safely with others. As far as its recreational ability, I find it to have some, while users find it to have none. Its no Xanax when it comes to euphoric sedation, but it definitely produces a noticeable effect that is fairly unique. On its own, the sedation can be quite overwhelming. A simple dose of 50mgs can effect a person with no tolerance strongly, while I myself have easily taken four times my prescribed 100mgs to achieve an effect simular to standard sleep aids such as Lunesta and Ambien. The effect itself produces sedation and a mild euphoria based on extreme contentness. It inhibits functioning to a degree, and slows down processing of information. The effect is unique, and definitely exists.In combination with other drugs, it produces a variety of effects.In combination with Marijuana, it increases the sedativeness and reduces inhibitions more, with less thought put into whats leaving my mouth, and less thought put into retaining my attention as to where and who I am. Somewhat reminiscent of the dissociated feeling. I have never encountered problems with the mix, and have never had seizures on the two, no matter how much of each I have ingested.In combination with Alcohol, I lose my friends. The little label on my medicine bottle was for real about avoiding alcohol on this medication. The only time I had more than a beer or so of alcohol on this medication ended horribly. Of all the experiences with Quetiapine that I've had, this is definitely the worst. I had been eagerly awaiting drinking with my pals, and had two extra Seroquel on me, as this was my bedtime dosage at the time. I remember discussing with my friends briefly about an interaction between the Seroquel and the beer we were about to come ahold of, and we sort of shrugged it off, while keeping it in the back of my mind. I don't remember drinking my first beer, or my second, or anything else of that night for that matter. What I do remember are simply images.Apparently after finishing my third beer and starting on my fourth, I had unzipped my pants and commenced urination on the kitchen cabinets. Apparently I had mistaken my location immensely, although I don't remember any of the actual events even leading up to it. What I do remember is being woken up from my place on the couch and being scolded by the owners child, and was told I had to leave the house. This upset me pretty well, since I lived an hours walk away, and didn't know even at that time what I had done. What I know now is that I had taken my two Seroquel, on top of the one I had taken for the morning, adding to at least 300mgs in my system in conjunction with the beers. In my effort to get out and call my mom, I was extremely inebriated and mistook a bottle for my shoe I had been searching for, and I'm sure I gave more than the initial first effort to put it on my foot. All in all, I ended up calling my mom to get picked up in the wee bit of the morning, and haven't drank on them since, besides the occasional shot when I've forgotten I've taken my Seroquel.In combination with Oxycodone, it seems to lengthen the experience and produce a heavier layer of the buzz. I popped a 100mg every time I snorted a 15mg OxyIR, and the effect seemed to remain the same each time. I may have also taken Hydrocodone while on the Seroquel, but my memory fails me and I refuse to put out information which may prove to be untrue. But as for Oxycodone, I can verify the lyrics in the Lil Whyte song, as it definitely increases the effects felt.In combination with Methylphenidate, the reactions seem to be safe. I remember taking at least one 36mg Concerta  on my prescribed 100mg dose, biting it in half to encourage a faster onset and everything, and had no problems. During the time, I consumed up to three 36mg Concertas a day, although the particular experience I remember involved only one. If anything, it probably reduced the mental effects of the Concerta.In combination with Caffeine, it feels nice. I remember a period in time where I was staying home from school, and I would make a pot of coffee for myself, chewing a Seroquel each time I slammed down a cup. I make my coffee very strong, and what I remember of the experiences back then seem to suggest that it takes away some of the mental slow down and inebriation of the Seroquel.In combination with Methylenedioxymethamphetamine, it seemed to raise no problems, although my experience, and the previous experience of a rolling friend did not include Seroquel until after the peak of the MDMA. I recently used it after coming down from a roll I had bought on a night we had expected to go to a party. The party got busted before our walking caravan made it even close, so the few of us around after the walk decided to pop the Seroquel I had kept on me that day. I ended up taking four in total that day, with 200mgs in the morning, and 200mgs in the afternoon before finally retiring for a day and a half. As for my other rolling friend who had taken one, he seemed to report to me that he had been out of it after ingestion, and he seemed to of had a safe time. All in all, I would say Seroquel is wonderful for  getting to sleep after rolling, although I've only had one strong experience with MDMA involving Seroquel.In combination with Zolpidem, it seems to enhance the trippiness often reported with Ambien. An example would be a night that me and my friends decided to spend the night at another friends house to smoke weed and eventually pop Ambiens, for me being the first time. I decided to pop two 10mgs, while another friend of mine popped one 10mg and a 25mg of Seroquel. Thinking back now it seems that the Seroquel potentiated the effects of the ambien, as when I hysterically reported my slight hallucinations to the rest of the group, my other friend who had also ingested the Seroquel reported the same effects, and seemed to be just as thrilled about them as me. I ended up ingesting a small amount of seroquel that night, along with around 3mgs of Ambien, and the effects stayed at the same plateau, unfortunately void of the prior hallucinations.In combination with Phenobarbital, the effects seem the same. I had ingested 259.2mgs prior to writing this, with two booster pills popped during the writing. I don't notice any synergy with the Seroquel, although it may be true that my mental system is slowed even more so in combination. I had insufflated 100mgs prior to getting the idea of taking the Phenobarbital, and proceeded in reading up on interactions online before doing so. I have over time now taken 324mgs of Phenobarbital in combination with the Seroquel, and feel pretty thoroughly sedated. The slight research I did prior to ingesting the Phenobarbital lead me to write this report documenting my interactions with Seroquel.Also, on the Fourth of July I had taken one of my moms prescription Benzonatate capsules she had been prescribed to for a cold I had been experiencing that week. I smoked Marijuana all day on it without a problem, but experienced extreme dysphoria after ingesting a Seroquel since I had passed them out to two of my friends. I had planned not to take it that day because of the Benzonatate, but forgot, and ended up paying the price. I spent the night indoors with the most terrible feeling I've had from a substance since DXM. My head felt fuzzy and clogged up, and it felt as though I had a full-head migraine. I was barely able to walk, only getting up every hour or so, and could not eat at all. Taking Seroquel on the Benzonatate ruined my Fourth of July, and a perfectly good opportunity to party. First of all, this was probably my fourth or fifth time I’ve tried Purple Sticky Salvia. But this time was like none of the others. This was because the drug was mixed with the alcohol I had consumed throuout the night. My friends all left my house to get something to eat, while my friend and I stayed behind at my house. We had just played about five games of beer pong and 10 to 12 beers later, I was definitely very drunk. I’m not a “light weight,” but I didn’t eat anything since that morning. I’m pretty sure this was why I tripped so badly. I suddenly remembered I had half of a gram of Salvia that I needed to smoke by the end of the night.I took my bong and packed a rip full to the top of the bowl without any water. I was told the water would filter the salvia and limit the effect of the hallucagenic. I slowly milked the Salvia up to the top of the bong and cleared the rip into my lungs. I held the smoke in for about 20 or 30 seconds and then I leaned back onto the wall behind me and exhaled. This was the last moment of my conscious stage. From then I was in a different world. Words alone cannot explain what was happening to me. Right now, I try to explain to you what I went through, but I’m only capable of telling you what I can write down in words. The feelings and memories I had can only be absorbed through the exact experience itself.I faded off into another world… Another dimension. Before I could realize what kind of stage I was actually in, a new force took hold of me. I was no longer under my own control, but being controlled by a power of colors and voices. I started to hear a teasing, happy voice. A chanting childish hymn starting singing to me. I can’t recall what exactly they were saying, but it was something like “something, something, salvia. Something, something, salvia.” It kept repeating. At first I tried to go along with it and enjoy the weird state of mind I was in, knowing that I was definitely fucked up. But then it overwhelmed me. I had entered 'their' world, and they wanted me to know it. It was like it was an uncompleted atmosphere, similar to an unfinished map or level in a video game. In my mind, I started to get pissed off at the teasing force that was almost messing with me. At that point I felt like I needed, no matter what to regain control. In my mind, I was yelling at this force to stop what it was doing to me and let me go. I was telling this force, “just seriously fucking stop, let me get back to normal.” This was as I started to really trip bad. As I was telling this unknown power to stop what it was doing, it was just laughing back at me. I was positively convinced that this was real. Very real.  This was the trippy part. All of these feelings and emotions I was having seemed too familiar. Like I had experienced this exact trip before, but this time it was going to be taken to the maximum extent. Almost like a Déjà vu, but I knew this was getting worse than it was when I had experienced it last. This force knew I had been here before too. Everything was getting way out of control. It was as if the force knew I was in its power and could not get out of it. It continued to watch me and laugh while the singing repeated. I can try to describe this force as best as I can through words:There was a wall of bright, vibrant colors composed of pink, yellow, green, light red, light blue, and so on. This “wall” was pushing my body and mind back, and I could not stop this force. I was now part of “their” world. When I say their world, I’m talking about a completely different world than the one I was in. I was in a different dimension, no where near the one in which we live. There was a real path that was possible to be taken through time and space. I was visualizing a mathematical equation for the journey to be traveled to this exact point. It was and would always be there, but you can't see it. This “force” knew I was in “its” world, and that it had complete control over me. The voice behind it laughed at me as I panicked and begged for a way out. This “voice” laughing at me that I speak of was unexplainably real. They were sort of blurry creatures that I could imagine, but not see. They were definitely there, but at the same time, they weren’t. The laughing voice mixed with the wall of colors made up the force that was driving me damn close to insane.By this time I had completely forgotten that my friend was still with me. Because of the many voices all singing to me, I thought I might have been with all my friends who left my house a little while ago. But mainly I was alone (except for 'them.') I wasn’t on his level, or on the normal level I was normally on. I was in a different world. I was trapped inside the world of “the force.” And this force seemed to keep laughing at me because it knew I could not escape. In my mind, it was as if there was something I needed to do, in order to get back to normal. In order to be back inside by body. To be human again. I was in this completely other world that seemed so unbelievably real. All I could think about was how to get normal and out of this insane world that had total control of me.I tried doing anything to get to my normal self. I tried to breath in and out really hard, I tried walking in circles to get my body functioning normal. This was extremely hard, as this whole time I was not even part of my body. My actual self was just reacting to what my mind was seeing and believing. I saw my dog lying outside and spotted her as something part of my normal life, and something that would bring me a chance to get normal. I thought that if I started petting my dog like I normally would do, it would bring me out of this chaotic world that I was in. I petted my dog over and over trying to get out of the weird dimension I was in and the world that the “force” dominantly controlled. I did whatever I could to return to my normal state, however the whole concept of me being in my body seemed foreign to me. It's hard to explain, but I couldn't comprehend the fact of being inside my body. During my trip, I was no where near my body. My mind was tripped inside this insane world controlled by this evil force, and my body would just respond and react to whatever my mind would do.My friend who I was with was explaining to the rest of my friends who got back from eating what I was acting like. He said I would just sort of say one or two words, and then blabber the rest of a sentence that was incomprehensible. I remembered what I was actually doing when he told them this. I would try to warn him that I was being taken away into another world, but then the force of the “salvia” would drown my words into my trip. I tried several times to get him to help me, which was when I would say a couple words to him, but the evil force would notice this and not allow me to talk. This was what resulted in the blabber which he heard. I was literally trying to get him to save me from the force taking me into its world. But the overwhelming “force” prevailed and wouldn’t allow me to finish my sentence in my plea for help.At that point, all that mattered was my escape. The world I was in would not let me get help, so I had to overcome it myself. I wandered outside of the room I smoked the salvia in, and tried as hard as I could to get this force's hold off of me and get out of their world. I threw my hat down into the dirt to attempt free up my head that was being held hostage. The chanting voice was still mockingly singing to me and it started to slowly fade. As did its incredible grasp on my mind.As he was telling them how scary it was for him to witness my trip, I just sat on my couch remising the insane events that just took place. I was still “semi-tripping,” not about what was currently going on inside my head, but what I had just experienced a few moments ago. I knew this dimension I had traveled to was real, and I had to explain to everyone else that it existed. I could not get over the fact that I knew for certain that this world I had visited existed and would always exist. This world and the “force” that occupied this world knew about us and our world, but we would never know about them. The only way to get back there was to get back to stage that I was in while on the Salvia. But of course, I would never dare to attempt to get back on it again. And now that I was almost back to normal, I never ever, ever wanted to be back in that dimension under the control of 'them.'I’m writing about this experience to you about 2 hours later after my trip and I am still not myself. I can tell myself that my trip and the other dimension I was in was all In my head and only due to the drug I was on, but inside, I will always know there’s that other dimension constantly there in a world parallel to our own. My experience on Salvia Divinorum will question my knowledge of existence and uncertainty forever. I don't even know man.

I endured vision loss at the age of 18 due to genetic reasons that caused me to go blind in my right eye and be left with center vision (no peripheral) in my left.Drug use has been relevant in my life for quite some time. Having tried everything from heroin, cocaine, multiple downers, marijuana, acid, and mushrooms. Yet, never using anything but marijuana and alcohol on a steady basis, due to my own reasons and seeing others go through horrible heroin withdraw or anything comparable.T 00:00.00It was another Tuesday night like any other at the college, most of the people in the group we usually hung out with didn’t have classes on Wednesday either. I started off my night normally around 10pm with a few chugs straight from the bottle of vodka and chasing with some water, as did a friend I had met, J. After we both were pretty set we went to the pepsi machine on the lower floor and both bought a pepsi and proceeded back upstairs to empty it to the top of the label and fill it back up with vodka so we could be mobile with our drinks and begin our night of going room to room and getting fucked up usually to the point of blacking out for myself.T 00:15.00Our usual hangout was on the 2nd floor with two good friends we both met that semester. But this time instead of just beer and an occasional bottle of liquor one of the two had a nice full bottle of Ritalin 30mg. Of course he asked if we were interested and since neither of us had ever done them before we each bought two of the (in my opinion) cigarette color looking pills. The night was just about to get interesting and horrifying beyond my imaginable dreams.T 00:30.00Excited about our recent acquisitions we both headed back to my dorm room and immediately sat down at the nearest desk with cigarette pack cellophane, lighters, college IDs, and the largest bill we had to blow them with. Neither of us thought twice about ingesting since it was our first time because we had been so use to blowing Percocet and vacating with ease. I might have done otherwise, but my lack of judgment was quite poor already from the vodka. We proceeded to empty out the tiny beads into our cellophanes, fold them up, and have at them with the lighter. We line them up and both took down the whole 30mg each in one run. I can remember sitting there sucking down any drip I could pull into my throat, having a slow onset of drowsiness and relaxation. After about 15 minutes of talking and me playing the guitar we both agreed it was time to hit up the 2nd and last one.T 00:40.00I remember myself feeling extreme relaxation not giving a fuck about my paper due on Thursday or a damn thing. I sunk so deep into thought I forgot J was in the room for a couple of minutes until he spoke up over the music. T 01:00.00Both of us feeling pretty damn good we decided to leave the room and go knock on some girls doors to check out for potential partiers... The first room we stopped at J already knew the one girl but the other he wasn’t sure of. He told me the one girl was real chill and wouldn’t care so not to worry about the constant and irritating sniffling and sucking coming from our noses and throats. We stepped inside and within 5 seconds I heard J clap his hands slightly. This was the sign all of us decided to do for me if something wasn’t cool, such as an RA, or just anyone we weren’t sure about so I don’t anything that could potentially get us busted. We did the hellos and introductions and it finally hit me, one of the best feelings from a drug I’ve had in awhile.I can remember hearing voices but I was so lost in thought and taking in the feeling of being yipped up that I paid no attention at all. Finally I snapped out of it thanks to J. “Dude, you want to sit down right here on the floor?” I replied slowly, “Uh….ya, ya man cool.” The feeling of overwhelming excitement, confidence, inspiration, and being hyped up just intensified with every passing minute. I wanted to get out of that room, not because we were unsure of the second girl, only because the thought of sitting down and still was the exact opposite of what my body wanted to do. The drips don’t help the situation at all either, but I didn’t care. I explained I simply had a cold…HAH!T 01:10.00Time seemed to fly by and mine and J’s conversation and speed only increased. Countless times interrupting one another, not intentionally being rude, from both being so eager to say what was on our minds... I vaguely remember from our conversation getting deeper and deeper, but I’m quite sure neither of the two girls said much as neither of us gave them a chance. I can still text, I just have to put my face closer to my cell and after another 15 minutes went by I sent J a text, “Dude, lets bounce and go grab another.” Seconds later, “FUCK yak!” We proceeded back down to the room and on the way I noticed something very unnerving. The sight which I did have was slowly becoming worse and worse, which I dictated to J who said no more after this next one then. Which I agreed not realizing at the time how much of a natural fiend I was.T 1:40.00J insisted that I didn’t get anymore cause of my one good eye showing bad signs. I agreed to make him happy and we decided to go meet up with R & B who was in another girl’s dorm different from the last. J got into conversation and I proceeded to pull R outside the room. Telling him I was too jacked up to get another one and asking if he would, aware at the fact I had been cut off. I gave him the money, he returned, and I headed back to my room using an excuse like “Be right back guys, got to go do some eye drops okay?”I remember having to lie on my bed and just rest due to trouble breathing and heavy sweating. Plus I was just completely yipped up and I needed to take in the 90mgs of Ritalin in thought. I lied there thinking about life, my future career, my life in general. Thinking to myself aloud, fuck I need to get on that paper for Thursday now. Did I clean my snake’s cage today? Piss, I need to do some laundry. Then, another direction hit me like a wave.Will I be an addict forever? Why is J fine with 3 and I needed yet another, pushing me to 120mg once I do it plus continuous vodka drinking, but not like normally, much less…for now. Quickly after that thought I remember saying aloud to nobody, “Fuuuuuuck it man I don’t give a fuck I’m skiin.” In a voice I couldn’t believe was mine, as if I was replying to someone. I blew the 4th one and after so long it kicked in…but this time unlike the last few. HARD! The 3rd had already been going and the 4th was hitting me like a freight train. I paced my room for about 5 minutes until I got a knock at my door by R & J. Who came to make sure I was alright and make me aware they know I pulled one behind both of them. J speaks, “Man, you said you were done after the 3rd I thought cause your eyes?” “Dude, I’m fine my eyes aren’t really that bad anymore.” Which was a bullshit lie if there ever was one? I went from good center vision to blurry vision so bad I had trouble walking my own dorm.T 02:00.00I have never been so fucked up before to the point of vision loss like that. Until I realized that R made a good point. “Dude, don’t you fucking have glaucoma a long with the other issues!? No wonder your sight is horrible the stimulants are playing on your eye pressure.” But I didn’t give a fuck; I shrugged what he said off to change the subject and suggested going outside to smoke. It was still cold as fuck out, so R went in and J stayed out as we chain smoked one after another. The conversation was extremely deep and full of emotion, admitting stuff we never have before to one another, our viewpoints on various subjects.But as deep as it was my memory of detail is very limited. I was too focused on concentrating on the incredible feeling at hand. Pure bliss, not a care in the fucking world, confident more than ever before feeling like I’m on top of the world wanting to get up and run forgetting about security but the sight stopped me. It was around 30 degrees outside yet I had no idea I was so entrapped in my thoughts. I finally snapped out of it as we took our conversation deeper for another 30 minutes or so before going back in. Not realizing till it was pointed out, and getting back in the whole time snapping my fingers for the slightly bit of stimulation I could achieve.T 04:00.00The next I was NOT ready for…the come down. I wasn’t aware, nor I had I been informed of it. I went from loving life, confident, wanting to run a mile, and euphoria. Straight to the complete opposite of the part I loved so much. Despair, depressed, anxiety to the point my body was in a full visual tremble to anyone around me, hands being the most noticeable. My heart was racing. I wanted it to be over, I wanted more to cease this horrible unexpected fall from 1000ft straight to the ground within what seemed like minutes.The dude who had it denied having more. I immediately left from an anxiety rush I hope to never endure again. I thought, “Holy FUCK I just barged in there asking, who all was in the room? They’re going to beat on me…I’m fucking screwed. The walk two flights up to my dorm and down the halls were just as worse. I felt like I was being watched from every corner and every peep hole. Making it to my room, still freaking out and heart racing so fast I thought it was near explosion I lied on my bed not knowing what to do with myself. Now just like the high but complete opposite again, every second passed sent me deeper and deeper into the horrible, agonizing, come down of this thought to be incredible drug which only sent me into wave after wave of absolute paranoia. Thinking I was hearing knocks and voices outside my room talking about me, wanting to get me busted for my current state?Each hour that passes it gets worse so I turn to the bottle of vodka. Chugging it and not worrying about chasing. By the time the sun came up I had less than a quarter left and could not acquire my drunk I wanted so badly in hopes to ease this suffering. I walked around the campus that morning after finishing the vodka an hour or so later and smoked a full pack of cigarettes and then some. Calling everyone and their mother I knew who did any drug to find me more methyl or phets, no luck. I went back to my room to lie down and fell into such a depressed state I lied there with a blank stare and thoughts going 100 miles a minute, falling in an out of consciousness many times but unaware of the times exactly.T 8:00.00 (Return to Room – Real Time – 10:00am) The feeling the morning after from a night of 120mg of Ritalin and a ½ gallon of vodka was unimaginable. I was truly waiting for myself to pass out with all thoughts of never waking again. I was so afraid, from my history with drug rehabs, of getting caught on that much Ritalin and vodka being underage that I chose possible death over 911. That night still and will forever haunt me. It took a solid two to three days to fully regain the vision I had prior to these events. I didn’t care during it all but thinking I caused more vision loss once I came down, only made it 10x worse. I am six months clean as of today. I am eightteen years old, and I am still in treatment for my addiction to drugs. My story is long and complex, but genuine. I am taking some time to reflect on what I've done to my family, my friends, and myself for the past 5 years.I started using somewhere between the ages of 12 and 13. As usual that's the age where adolescents start to expose themselves to the wonders of alcohol and drugs. I had no previous expierence with either of the two accept for a sip of beer on new years my dad gave me when I was 6. I vividly remember a party my friends and I were having. We invited some girls over, and we got a case of beer and some liquor. I took a few sips of liquor with some soda, and had about 4 beers. I got drunk for the first time that night.Normally being a socially awkward and very introverted person, the alcohol I consumed made me feel good. It made me feel more comfortable with myself, and therefore more comfortable in a social setting. I was talking to girls, smoking cigarettes, ect. Just being one of the guys, it felt good. I continued to drink at various parties all the way through 7/8th grade. Things started to change at this point, I started changing the way I dressed and shifted away from my friends, and tword the dirtbag type of people. Mainly because I felt comfortable and less pressured around these seemingly mellow ladies and fellows. They introduced me to Marijuana.Me and 2 of these kids walked up to a cemetary and smoked a few bowls. I didn't get high, but I continued to smoke with them reguardless, just to feel comfortable around them and for them to like me. After several nights of this, I did get high and I laughed untill Tears came out of my eyes. I loved it, I loved the feeling of not caring, just looking at even the most serious of situations and just cracking up. All my worries were pretty much phased out when I was high, and I liked this. By 9th grade I started smoking weed on a regular basis. Throwing down on a bag after school, buying my own pot, getting my own bowl, papers, dutch, bong, whatever. I started to smoke everyday, to the point where I was pretty much in a 24/7 stoned state. More importantly I started smoking on my own, and prefered it that way. Many a night I would just sit in my room, high, watching tv, and be perfectly content with the world. My parents started to worry, grades were dropping, money was missing, but they never found enough evidence that an excuse coulden't handle. Besides, I had the upper hand, what parent wants to think there kid is smoking pot?The cicle rolled on into summer, when drugs were very abundant in my town. I had a part time job, and allot of friends. Parties every weekend ect. I started getting offered different substances, things I'd never heard of. I found erowid.org, and did some research on drugs.I discovered and had my first taste of Painkillers. Vicodin's, Oxycontins's, whatever my friends could get from there parents medicine cabinets. By tenth grade, I was in a band with some kids I met from another town. They were pretty down and out people, but being the dumb ass I was I thought they were the shit. They offered me some Meth which I tried and indulged into slightly, but I never did enough to get really hooked. Eventually I tasted LSD, and Mushrooms through the same group of people. There was a shortage of pot in our town, so me doing my research came across DXM which I took pretty much every week from the time I tried it, onward. Drugs pretty much became my life at that point. In every social setting I presented myself to be a drug addict, to look cool, but also, because deep down, I started to feel like one.Once the summer came about again, I had ditched my girlfriend and met up with a kid who was into doing coke. I told him I could get him some, not really being serious, and next thing I know he's at my house telling me to round up 30$ (coke fiends really are that desperate). I got some money and we threwdown on a gram we got from some of those friends of mine. He cut up the lines in a bathroom of Dunkin' Dounuts, and sniffed them infront of me. He offered me a line and at first I hesistated. But peer pressure took control, as did my growing addiction and I snorted a big fat line. I scurried out of there saying to myself 'It's over, it's done with, nothing happened'. When the effects began to take hold.I was feeling like a fucking GOD. I was walking around and I was everybodys best fucking friend. I was highfiving and hugging people I never even met. Talking up a fucking storm, I loved it, I was the shit now, I was the guy everybody loved. From then on coke become priority #1. I spent all of my job money on coke, All of my friends money on coke, stole, robbed, lied, pawned my possesions, whatever I could to get more coke. It was the the point that 3 months down the line I didn't feel shit from coke, So I got the bright idea to start smoking rock.I cooked it up using an online tutorial, literally in my kitchen. I smoked out of a stem one of my friends gave me to hold onto. I was fucking flying. I thought coke was the epitome of pleasure, but I was oh so wrong. Rock is totally different from coke, yet similar. The feeling is so much better, but just when your getting a full fledged taste, it's gone and you need more. Around this time I had a girlfriend who did coke with me, and we were on a 500$ a week habbit. We'd buy it, part ways, I'd smoke, she'd sniff. My addiction was out of control, It was either rock, pot, DXM, pills, or any other interesting things that were around town that week.Eventually the new thing became Heroin. People started going into the city and scoring a bundle or 2 and coming back and selling it to us kiddies. A friend of mine we can call E was pretty much a full fledged junkie at this point. I gave him some money and he got me a bag of dope. I sniffed it and wow. I was used to doing coke, so when i saw what a bag amounted to in a line I thought it would be nothing. Man was I wrong. I was fucked up beyond all belief. More importantly I totally didn't care. I could lose everyone I loved and just shrug it off. That feeling is just to strong, more powerfull that any emotion I have ever felt. I nodded off a dozen times that night, and eventually found a friends place to crash at and puked up a storm in his garbage pail, and passed out. I continued to give E my money hoping for a score. He ripped me off several times (junkies really are that desperate).The few times I got it I sniffed it, but eventually I started going right to the people who were giving it to him. I payed them my money and got my moneys worth. Bags were coming in left and right, I watched them shoot it, and became intrigued. Thought about it for a second, and tried it. Ahhhhh, that rush, that fucking chill that goes down your spine when dope enters the bloodstream and just rearanges your dopamine and serotonin. So much faster, so much stronger than snorting it. I was hooked. Dope and Rock, my two new best friends.Eventually I was nothing anymore, I walking shell of my former self. If I didn't have my fix for that day, I was begging for money, or stealing from somebody. My friends, my real friends, finally told someone about the shit I was doing. I got called into the principles office, they searched me and, I disovered how fast the cops can get to your school when they hear the word Heroin. I was arrested on possesion of Heroin and Marijuana. This was last March(2006). I entered Rehab and turned my life around.I got clean, I worked on allot of my issues that I was using drugs to cope with. I expressed my insecurities without being fake or hiding. I became a person again. I realise what I did to everybody who loved me was terrible, and I'm so fucking lucky that they love me enough to forgive me. I am happy now, and I have a future ahead of me. Even though I know I may live the rest of my life wanting a hit, I know that for today I don't need it. I have been doing Mephedrone on and off for the past 3 months, aprox 600mg a night. its legal, similar to MDMA, and relatively cheap. This drug is perfect for me. This is one of my best experiences to date. My mood was good, even more so after 4+ beers and some good hard trance/dance/liquid drum & bass to get me in the mood. Previous drug experience = cannabis, magic mushrooms, codeine, small amounts of ecstasy. a lot of alcohol if that counts.Start of the night: its Saturday night. I was preparing to go night clubbing with some good friends. I often have a few lagers at home then head out into the local town, meet my mates then go into the city and get drunk (or recently, drunk and Mephedroned)T+0:00 - Currently at home. Just had a bath & sorted myself out for the night. I sit in front of my PC and listen to some trance classics, go on Facebook, drink some booze and roll a cig. Dab out aprox 100mg and snort it. My nose has started to grow accustomed to snorting this substance so it doesn't sting that much as it used to. However the drip tastes terrible and usually makes my mouth dry.T+0:12 - Heart race increases, thumping away in my chest. Warm fuzzy feeling. EuphoricT+0:20 - Drink some more booze and sniff another line. Maybe shouldn't have been so hasty to do this one. Never mind.T+0:25 - Definitely coming on now. Clear headed, very sped up. Legs bounce up and down, feeling very excited. Heart is hammering away. Check my eyes and pupils, not too big but noticeable. Turn my music up and wave my arms about. Feel awesome.T+0:27 - feeling very blissful, at peace with the world, yet very fast. Get up and move around, feel like superman zipping around the place. Whisper to myself 'Fuck, this feels amazing', breathe heavily. Jaw clenching.T+0:45 - Overwhelming urge to ring people, decide to ring a female friend of mine and have a chat. End up having a very deep chat about random rubbish, feels good to chat. Awesome euphoric physical buzz going through my entire body. Text a few people telling them how good I feel and how special they are to me.T+0:50 - Realize I need to head up town pretty quickly if I'm going to meet my mates and catch the bus to head into the city. Bomb a small amount, finish my 5th can and walk up town, approx half a mile. Walking feels effortless, almost like gliding. Legs feel light. Everything feels amazing. Can't wait to see my mates. Feels like Christmas as a young child.T+1:05 - fuck, I feel good.T+1:10 - Meet 5 of my friends, give two of my mates 1/2 a gram between him and her. The rest of my friends with us are just drinkers. Get on the bus, head into the city. Best bus ride I've ever had. Can't stop talking. Apparently my eyes were massive. More jaw clenching and grinding. Get my phone out and play some music, music is a MUST on this conquest. T+1:30 - Speak to some random ladys on the bus, get a hug and a kiss on the cheek, say bye to the driver and glide off the bus with my mates. Go to a near-by pub, get a double vodka and coke, my two mates go and snort a line. I do a line shortly after, probably around 100mg, drink my vodka and chat. Feeling very good, talking is so easy I feel more sociable than I've ever felt. Lots of smiling and chatting between all of us. Very strong bond.T+ 2:00 - Head to a big night club, get some special tickets which allow us to jump the que and get a free drink. Awesome. I'm not buzzing quite as hard now, in fact feeling slightly drunk. However I still feel awesome and very content and blissful. Smoke a cig and head into the club.T+2:10 - Order a drink with friends, the lights and music are truly amazing. Bass is thumping through me, lights playing with my brain, beautiful. They were playing mainly hip hop/r&b, would of been better with some trance/dance, but none the less can't wait to get dancing! Drink my drink, chat a bit more. Jaw clenching. Firsts thing first, off to the bathroom for another line.T+2:15 The line was fat. My nose is now burning. My head is now rushing. Feeling sweatyT+2:17 - Run back downstairs, the place is packed. Smile and say hello to anybody and everybody. Feel connected with every soul in the place. Find my friends, tell them how fucking awesome I feel. Two of them go for another line. Meet up with some more friends, see some other people I know, put my arm around them and we all glide off onto the dance floor... Ohhhhhhh yeah!T+2:25 - The last line hit me. I am rushing. Whole body buzzing, legs feel light. Lights flickering, eyes wobbling everything is beautiful. I must have looked like the guy from The Streets - Blinded By The Lights track. Reach my hands up for the roof, rub my face and neck, jaw clenching and grinding, caught in the moment of one of the best feelings ever.T+ 2:30 - The rest of my friends join me on the dance floor. We are all united as one, dancing, moving. The two friends that had also been doing Mephedrone tell me how amazing they feel. I will keep her name anonymous, but this girl is noticeably fucked, eyes like dinner plates. She tells me shes done quite a few lines. She tells me how amazing I am, we go off for a deep chat and compliment each other, bonding like never before, she is also gurning and grinding her jaw. Her boyfriend was a little un-easy about our level of connectivity.T+3:00 - More dancing. no more booze for me, only water. Can't focus very well. Eyes wobbling.T+ Unknown - Possibly another line, can't remember. Body rushing everywhere, legs feel weird, get some attention from bouncers and nearly get kicked out. Some friends sit me down. Sweating. Everything is rushing.T+ Unknown - Can't stay still any longer, go for another dance. Go for a cig, chat to some randoms.T - Unknown - wonder off on my own, chat to random people. Mouth tastes pretty nasty, a mixture of cigs, booze, and Mephedrone. Can't find my chewing gum.T - Unknown - Meet everyone, exit the club. Feel myself coming down a bit, very relaxed. Get a taxi back to the town with everybody. Stop off at a petrol station and get some gum. Though hazy relaxed eyes I felt a smile on my face as I made eye contact with the nice looking lady behind the desk. I look into her deep brown eyes, there was a glint in them, it was like looking into a beautiful endless void. She smiled back. Felt a warm wave go through my chest, broke eye contact as we exchanged items of money and gum. look back into her deep eyes as I put my gum in my pocket. She was still smiling, a connection had been made. A thought flew through my mind at a split second 'Perhaps she could be a future girlfriend, perhaps I will never see her again'Wanted to stay and get to know her but didn't want to keep the taxi driver waiting. Said bye, walked back to the taxi, go back to a mates house, sit and talk for hours.All in all, a good night. Sorry for the dodgy time scale, half of the night is from memory. Mephedrone is far too more-ish. Its addictive, the urge to re-dose was always there. I think I need to stop sniffing it and start bombing it. However I felt absolutely awesome. It did take me awhile to get to sleep, I woke up feeling OK with a slight hangover but nothing too severe.Recently I have been having increasingly bad come downs that leave me physically and emotionally drained for days, so I might have a break from it for a few months. Allow me to preface this writing with some background information:I've done a lot of experimentation with various substances over the years.  I learned my limitations as well as the substances I'd never try again.  Methamphetamine is one of the major drugs at the top of that 'never again' category.I recently moved to a college town, and Adderall is very common around here.  As much as I should know about drugs by now; I didn't realize Adderall was an amphetamine - thus, it should have fit the same category as meth.  This was my first (and last) experiment with Adderall.__________________________________________________________________________________Last Saturday, a very good friend of mine (I’ll refer to him as X) and I were chilling out at my apartment.  We were watching some sports and drinking very heavily (approximately 5:00 P.M.-12:00 A.M.)  After we were both very much intoxicated, X asked me if it was alright if he blew a few lines of Adderall.  I’d given him some grief about using it in the past, but I told him I didn’t care.  He offered me some, but I refused it.  After he’d finished a few pills, he got up and suggested that we hit the club and chase some girls.  I was beyond the point of being able to socialize, so I told him to just go by himself.  I wanted to pass out.As soon as he’d left, my roommate arrived with some of his friends.  They wanted to party.  I didn’t feel comfortable with people I didn’t know being here, so I decided to stay up with them.  I could tell I was embarrassingly drunk, and I didn’t want to make an ass of myself in front of new people.  I looked at the plate my friend had used to snort the Adderall, and there was a lot left.  I knew people used Adderall to focus, stay awake, and bring themselves “up” from a drunken state.  I took the plate to my bathroom, rolled up a dollar bill, and snorted what was left.  It didn’t hurt like I expected it to, and there were no immediate effects.  I went back out to the living room to hang out with my roommate and his friends.All of a sudden; I felt awake and clear.  I became more of an extrovert than I’d ever been in my life.  Considering all the alcohol consumption that had occurred (and ended minutes prior); I was suddenly totally sober.  After a short while, my roommates friends asked me how much I’d had to drink.  I told them how much, then asked, “Why, am I making a drunken ass out of myself or something?”  One remarked, “No, but you’re insane!  I’d be puking my guts out.”  I got paranoid for a second, because I didn’t want them to think I was an alcoholic or something but then I didn’t care because it might impress them but who cares what they think because I’m totally straight and maybe the Adderall didn’t do anything and it was just the food I’d eaten that sobered me up and why are we watching a Jackie Chan movie and I have to be somewhere tomorrow and maybe life is wonderful.  My mind was racing like this non-stop.  I was composing myself and being very careful to talk sensibly and not stream of consciousness babble.  I hope my state of mind was conveyed here.I had really bad dry mouth, but I wasn’t thirsty.  I forced myself to keep drinking some wine in order to try to calm my mind and body down.  By the time they left (about 4:00 A.M.), I’d drank enough that I was tired again.  Then, X showed up again.  I could tell he was flying (he’d done about 4 or 5 more pills at the club), and I didn’t want him to stay there chatting me up for hours on end.  He asked if he could do some more Adderall, and I told him he could only if he gave me some.  We split a pill, and then I snorted some wine to speed up the drip.  We kept drinking as he told me his club story, and at this point time stopped existing.  I have no idea how long we talked.  I had consumed a total of 4 40oz malt liquors, 6 12 oz. beers, and 5 glasses of wine, but I was still awake.  Eventually, I told him I was feeling tired.  He left, and I laid down on my couch.  I don’t actually think I went to sleep.  Everything was just black for what could have been five minutes or god knows how long.I shot awake suddenly.  It was as if someone had dumped ice water on my face.  I was extremely alert and my mind was telling me I should get more Adderall.  I had a headache (not the alcohol induced type, either): my nose and face were stinging: my body ached (well, it was actually more flushed and I felt hot): and I wanted more Adderall.It was a Sunday morning (I recall looking at the clock and seeing it was about 10:30 A.M.) and I had to be somewhere in a few hours.  On the way there, I felt so tense.  It was as if I was driving to “face the music” so to speak, and this is odd because the outing was to a place that is very pleasant. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I had some pretty random periods of irritability.  I had to force feed myself dinner, and drinking anything (even water) was a chore.  After getting back to my apartment later Sunday night, I hit a psychological wall.  I was so depressed and uneasy.  X called me to ask for a ride to get cigarettes.  When I told him I felt shitty, he offered me Adderall in exchange for the ride.  I didn’t want any of it, so he offered to buy me a pack of smokes.After I picked X up, he asked, “So, man, isn’t Adderall the shit?”  I said, “No, it is shit, and I haven’t felt quite this shitty since I tried meth a few years ago.  It’s garbage.”I couldn’t sleep when I got home.  I was wide awake, but at least I was able to drink water without choking it down.  As the hours and minutes ticked away, I got more depressed than I’ve ever been in my life.  I’d been “awake” 46 hours or so, and I started getting paranoid.  I called my friends and started giving them these insanely paranoid and bizarre stories.  My friends all suggested the same thing, “Calm down, and get some sleep.  Things will be better this afternoon.”I skipped all of my responsibilities yesterday to sleep.  It was a deep and dark sleep.  I woke up in the late afternoon and felt a lot better.  I decided to go online and study the drug I’d used, and immediately noticed that it contains “amphetamine salts.”   I was so pissed at myself for trying it without researching it first.  I won’t repeat that mistake again. I've had previous experiences with wormwood before. The experiments involved using an eyedropper to drop the wormwood (in liquid extract form) into a shot of vodka. Due to wormwood's infamous bitterness, it goes without saying that this mixture tasted terrible. However, the effects of the wormwood had proven to be fairly potent, much like a giddy stoning effect that could not be attributed to alcohol alone. I wanted to continue my experiments with wormwood, but I needed a way to get around the taste.While researching on the internet, I found out that one cheap and easy way of making absinthe is to simply mix wormwood back into a thujoned-free (which is all that is legally available in the U.S.) bottle of Pernod Absinthe. This poor-mans' absinthe is a welcome alternative to buying a $200+ bottle from Europe.So, last Saturday night (around midnight) I mixed a 750ml bottle of Pernod Paris (not Pernod Absinthe) with a 30ml bottle of liquid wormwood extract. In order to allow the bottle room for the extract, I decided to first drink a couple ounces of the Pernod. Though the ones sold off the shelf (at least in the U.S.) don't have the thujone, it's still a yummy drink. To be honest, I find it a bit reminiscent of NyQuil, except it's more refined.Anyway, after drinking about three or four ounces of the Pernod, I decided to add in the wormwood extract. I unceremoniously dumped the foul smelling liquid into the Pernod, which, after being stirred with a straw for about a minute, changed from its original happy translucent emerald-yellow into a forebodingly opaque poison green. Such an evil metamorphosis gave me brief pause, but, resolute to continue my experiments with *Artemisia absinthium*, I marshalled my will and sally forthed.Pouring about two ounces of the homemade brew into a goblet, I added a couple ice cubes and watched them crack and fizz in the glass. Swishing the concoction about, I found myself uncharacteristically hesitant to follow through with the experiment. From previous encounters, I knew well the sheer *nastiness* of the taste of wormwood, the unholy smell of ultimate bitterness. However, I did my duty and slowly poured the potion down my gullet. It was bitter; I grant that. In the grand scheme of all things bitter, what I drunk last night was *bitter*. Bitter indeed. *But* it was not *that* bitter, not nearly as terrible as the evil poison of my previous experiments. For whatever reason, the Nyquil-esque Pernod helped alleviate the more wicked characteristics of the drink. Next time I might drop a sugar cube in to make it more palatable, but what I drunk was bearable, if not exactly pleasant. As for the effects, they were rapid and pronounced. Only a couple minutes after my ingestion did I feel the familiar wooziness that I find characteristic of a wormwood trip. I suppose at least some of the effects can be attributed to the alcohol, but my tolerance for spirits is such that I find it highly unlikely that a mere few ounces of liquor could properly account for the sheer inebriation that I felt. A sense of giddiness swept over me, and I stumbled to my room to lie down. I felt the desire to listen to music, but found myself too intoxicated to remove myself from my bed. Through my body, I felt a vague sense of being poisoned - but not enough to cause discomfort. I lay there, thinking great thoughts concerning the mind-body problem and had vivid flights of fantasy regarding myself as a Medieval count fighting Muslims (I spent much of the day playing the computer game 'Crusader Kings'). After a couple hours of lying in a stupor, I grew annoyed at the brightness of the lights and managed to stagger to the switch to turn them off. I must have went back to bed and fallen asleep, because I woke up ten hours later (around noon). I had no noticable hangover.Just from the alcohol, I should have felt no more than a slight drunkenness, and many of the effects I experienced, such as the lightheadedness, are atypical to my experiences with alcohol. On the other hand, I had not drunk for a couple weeks, and it is possible, though unlikely, that I lost my tolerance to such an extent that the equivalent of about three shots of an 80 proof liquor could put me in such a state of inebriation. Further experimentation is needed to isolate the effects of wormwood. [Erowid Note: The doses described in this report are potentially life threatening.

Similar doses can lead to coma or death in some individuals.]Under the No Child Left Behind signed into law by President Bush, each state was required to measure students' abilities in some form.  As a response to this, Ohio created the Ohio Graduation Test, or OGT as it is known.  This test is given to sophomores in high school over the course of one week, and where I live, they start the test at 7:30AM and take it until 10:00AM.  Because of this, all other students don't have to be in school until 10:05AM, and so my friends and I, who by now were no strangers to the fun of drinking and smoking, thought this new found time would be a great for a party.We had an open house, and more than enough people were willing to drink, smoke, or do whatever before the shortened school day.  We started the mornings at 7:45 with some eggs and followed it up by getting pretty smashed taking shots, playing beer pong, and getting stoned.  We even had an event name: OGT Week Beerpongapalooza.  I was pretty concerned about getting caught drunk at school, so on Monday and Tuesday, I didn't really party that much.  But, by Wedensday, my nerves had calmed and I let go.  I started the morning by taking two 20mg Adderall Extended Release pills.  Pretty soon the party was underway and about 20-30 people were at my friends house.  I was so excited that I started taking shots, and only stopped to smoke two or three bowls on my friends back porch.  When the bottle of Jose Cuervo was empty (there was about 15 shots in it when I started) I realized that I was really messed up, but I still asked everyone if they wanted to drink more.  Luckily, my friends were sober enough to realize that the last thing I needed was more alcohol.  The last thing I remember was throwing up in my friends car as he was driving us to school.  According to him, he took me home after that and I got out in my driveway and passed out immediately.  He opened my garage and took me inside and left for school.  I woke up at 1:00PM in my bed.  I must have set an alarm because my clock was buzzing like crazy.  As I sat up, I saw that I was completely naked and completely covered in puke.  Right then, one of the worst hangovers I've ever had hit me.  I layed back down, and glanced at the carpet in my room.  There were various piles of puke skattered through out my room.About 15 min. later, I felt alright enough to get out of my bed and walk around.  I headed toward the bathroom to take a shower, and saw that my bathtub was filled with about a quarter inch of puke.  I spent the next hour cleaning and throwing up from the smell of the cleaning chemicles.  I couldn't get all the stains out, but I figured I had it to a point where I could tell my parents that I came home and found that the dogs had thrown up.At 2:30PM, my friend who had dropped me off earlier in the day called to make sure that I was alive.  He told me that a bunch of our friends were headed to Subway, so I agreed to meet them there.  I get dressed and walk into my garage only to find a green car that did not belong to me and a maroon car that also did not belong to me parked there.  My car was gone.  Panicked, I called the owner of the green car, and he told me that he and the owner of the maroon car decided to take mine.  He even said that I gave them permission, and that they would return my car soon.In the end, my parents believed me that the dogs had thrown up when I was at school, but I still had to explain to my principal why I didn't make it to any of my classes.  I told her that I felt sick, but my mom didn't believe me so she didn't call to say I had permission to stay home, even though I did.  I was assigned one day of in-school suspension (basically, you sit in a small room for the entire school day).  I went to the parties on Thursday and Friday, but I held off on the drinking.  On Friday, my friend who drove me to my house on Wednesday was almost caught and threw up in the bathroom at the school.  But overall, OGT Week Beerpongapalooza was a success.So much of a success, that we decided to continue our morning parties during the regular school week for the rest of the year.  At my school we have a regular schedule on Monday, Tuesday, and Friday.  On Wedensday and Thursday, we have block scheduling, and on the first day of block, all the students don't have to come in until 9:00AM.  My town was even famous a few years back for the 'Dankfest Day' scandal, where a major newspaper uncovered kids smoking pot before school at a public park on block day.Anyhow, to make a long story short, someone who had came to our parties got caught at school.  And expelled.  Not only that, he ratted us out in the process.  The week after his expulsion, the police department staked us out.  Three kids were pulled over on the way to school, resulting in one charge of OMVAUC, or Operating a Motor Vehicle After Underage Consumption, which in Ohio, is when a minor gets a DUI.  Some kids who didn't get pulled over made it to school and were promptly interrogated by the administration, resulting in one 10-day suspension.Looking back on all this, I would agree that a lot of stuff got really fucked up.  But I would also say that it was a great once-in-a-lifetime experience, and that I wouldn't have changed a thing. I've been a daily pot smoker for a few years now. I'm also experienced with tobacco (I was never a regular smoker though) and have recently been tripping on shrooms on a regular basis (a few times a week, taking tolerance into account). I'm experienced with salvia and benzodiazepines. I am currently not taking any medication or supplement, and only have a Cannabis and psilocybin cubensis mushroom tolerance. I've never really considered using alcohol because 1) I don't consider it an entheogen and 2) I was a born Muslim, and while my family isn't very religious, my friends are, and most do not drink or do drugs. I don't consider marijuana against Islam, and I myself have never been religious. I am agnostic and spiritual but I do not believe in an organized religion. When I turned 21 I started buying alcohol for my friends who were still under-age. Today I was bored, cleaning up the house and about to smoke a joint when I stumbled across some alcohol from a few months back. I felt a little regret because morally I am not into 'fuck me up' drugs like alcohol, heroin, and cocaine. I've always been into the hallucinogens. The bottles had to go though, and I was not going to let this alcohol go to waste. My morals sat aside while down went a bottle of Heineken. This was chased by the remainder of a 750ml bottle of Bacardi (bottle says 40 proof alcohol by volume. It was around 1/2 a cup). The Heineken tasted awful but the harder stuff wasn't so bad. It tasted like the smell of isopropyl alcohol. I had not eaten in a few hours, and less than a minute after downing the stuff my stomach felt warm. I started getting excited but at the same time I was a bit nervous that the dose wouldn't have much of an affect. After about 15-30 mins, I noticed that I was a lot more relaxed (I normally have lots of anxiety) and was in an overall better mood. I also had to piss, but held it in for a while because I just felt good being sitting on the computer, and I'm a big boy and can hold it in. It wasn't bothering me too much. I finally stood up to go pee and noticed that my coordination was a bit off. If I concentrated I could balance myself on one foot for longer than 10 seconds, but I couldn't hold the pose forever. I pissed and then walked around my house, giggling and admiring the effects of this drug. I am still under the influence as I type this. This is similar to the benzos, but this is more euphoric. The benzos just make me emotionally numb and drowsy. I can definitely see the psychological addictive potential of alcohol. What Marijuana does to me is it really enhances my sense of hearing and taste, and greatly increases my creativity. I don't consider pot an intoxicant. Alcohol puts me in a great mood and I smile and laugh for no apparent reason. My typing is slow and I can't spell worth shit, but thankfully Firefox 2.0 has a built in spell checker. Anyway, normally I am depressed and my mind is stuck dwelling on the past. Dwelling on what I should of, or could of done. At this moment, however, I feel like my mind is Here Now. Music doesn't sound as good as it does while I'm high but I find interest in music I'm sick of when sober. Emotionally, I feel great. My negative feelings and anxiety have been abolished and I feel like doing something. Anything. I am somewhat bored. On pot I feel satisfied alone, but right now I am thinking about a girl I've recently taken a fancy to. It's more sensual than sexual. I have a few major problems going on in my life right now, but trying to think about them now just gives me an 'It's OK' response. Alcohol seems like a great way to escape life's problems, and I can see why some of my friends love the stuff. Overall, I find alcohol great to relax and unwind, and I can see why it's a great social/party drug. I do plan on trying a heavier dose in the future, but I will likely not use it anytime soon unless I am at a party or anywhere it is readily available. First, let me say that this is not the way I usually take cocaine. Typically, I take it after getting very drunk (half a bottle whisky say, which though I am a large man, a seasoned boozer, and can hold my liquor, definitely gets me completely tanked), and in dosages ranging from a quarter gram to one gram. This combination results, of course, in a state of complete gonzoism bordering on derangement.Tonight though, I started off with about a quarter gram of coke followed by very moderate beer-drinking. I didn't really feel high. After maybe an hour I was wishing I had more cocaine, so I snorted some Dilaudid (10 mg, I'm pretty sure). This took the edge off my comedown all right, but without producing any feelings of opium-like euphoria, though with a nice but far from overwhelming body buzz. My activity throughout the evening, by the way, consisted of sitting around talking with a similarly stoned old and good friend in his apartment.After about another hour, still feeling fairly fine—just slightly more interested in everything I thought about (from the cocaine) but duly mellow as well (from the Dilaudid)—I did another quarter gram of coke. This did get me genuinely high, though with no racing heartbeat or uncontrollable volubility, again due to the Dilaudid, I assume. About half an hour later I snorted 10 mg of Oxycontin. I'd never done it before, and knew it could be dangerous, but what with my really moderate (by my standards) alcohol intake and pretty low dosages of everything else, I thought the risk was minimal.Well, the Oxycontin very quickly delivered the intense body buzz and euphoria you'd expect from powerful opoids. It was (and still is) extremely pleasurable, especially combined with the heightened awareness of it and absence of dopiness provided by the cocaine. I do not feel deranged at all, and absolutely in control and just generally wonderful. Added to this is the calm provided by my expectation of having a pretty mild comedown, though we'll have to see if it turns out that way. But not knowing for certain that a terrible comedown awaits me adds to my sensation of well-being.I have a lot of experience (10 years plus) with fairly regular episodes of intense impairment from the combination of large quantities of booze and fairly normal amounts of cocaine. This buzz I'm experiencing now is similar to one time when I took over a gram of coke as well as a dangerous and frankly stupid amount of Oxycodone which had me in a drooling, throbbing stupor well into the following day. The combination of smallish doses I took tonight has given me very intense pleasure, comparable to that time actually, with, as far as I know, much less risk of killing myself. Since taking the Oxycontin a couple of hours ago, I've had a bit more cocaine (which was great, despite being the last of it) and am very slowly drinking some wine. I feel content and softly, quietly exhilarated, and I must say, like I've really got my money's worth, something I rarely feel after cocaine alone.

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]  I’ll just give you a quick description of myself before I get into anything. I was a freshman in high school at the time of this experience. Now I’m 15 and about to be a sophomore. I have a history of fairly heavy drug use. I’ve done hydrocodone, shrooms, morphine, codeine, promethazine, oxycodone, nitrous, keyboard duster, DXM, benadryl, valium, xanax, Ritalin, adderall, nutmeg, tobacco, inhaled gasoline, weed, and obviously alcohol.This was probably the most regretted and miserable drug experience I have ever had. As I describe to you what happened you will understand why. It gave me a new respect for alcohol and taught me to only drink responsibly because if you are reckless it can lead to some harsh consequences.It all started on a Friday afternoon when my parents picked me up after school to take me over to my grandmother’s house to stay for the weekend because they were going to be out of town. I was pretty excited about this because the last time I had been there I noticed she had a nicely stocked liquor cabinet in her living room that was left over from my grandfather’s drinking years (he was quite the alcoholic). When I got to my grandmother’s house, I said goodbye to my parents and sat down to watch some television with my cousin, who lives with my grandma because she is going to college in the community. I just wasted time all evening until they both went to bed and then I busted out the vodka. This was the first of two nights of heavy drinking, and this one wasn’t bad at all. I did about 15 shots and was fairly drunk but nothing uncontrollable.It was the second night that I got WAY too drunk. After my grandma and my cousin went to bed, I went and grabbed the 80 proof vodka and the shot glass. I went into the bathroom and poured myself about 8 shots in about 20 or thirty minutes. By this point I wasn’t horribly impaired, however I was being affected. I got on the computer, signed onto my instant messenger, and began talking to several of my friends. I stayed there for around 25 minutes and then told my friends I was going to do some more shots. I went into the bathroom and took about 6 more. I walked out into the computer room and sat down in the chair. Then again, I decided to go drink some more. I was already pretty drunk and wasn’t at all concerned about getting too much because I hadn’t ever thought about it before. This time I didn’t go to the bathroom. I went back to the liquor cabinet and grabbed a bottle of amaretto and took a few big swigs of it before I put it back. I spilled a whole lot of this shit on my shirt, which will later result in some pretty shameful events. Then I walked back into the bathroom and took about 6 more shots. I did this in about an hour, so by the time I stumbled out of the bathroom I was completely wasted. However, I could still function. I went and got back on the computer and started talking again. I was saying all kinds of stupid shit to everyone and laughing at it for about 30 minutes until I made a HUGE mistake. I went back in the bathroom. I hadn’t planned on drinking anymore because I knew I was already probably pushing it, but when I walked into the bathroom I saw the bottle and thought, why the hell not? After I did 3 more shots I started looking in the mirror and making faces. I began to laugh hysterically. Then I noticed some brown shit all over my shirt and remembered I had spilled some amaretto on myself. I decided to get in the shower and get cleaned up.I took off my clothes and got in, only to realize I still had my socks on. They were soaked so I took them off and put them on the floor by the shower. This is the last thing I remember. The next thing I knew I was waking up in my bed, ass naked with a KILLER hangover. This is the only hangover I’ve ever had and I’ve been drunk quite a few times, so I found this to be agonizing. I had blacked out before I could put any of the alcohol up. So even though I was in hell from my hangover I had to get up and put the vodka and shot glass away before anyone else woke up. Then in the bathroom I saw that I had thrown up all over the toilet. It seemed like an eternity until I was finished wiping up my puke. I knew I just wanted to die because I was feeling so goddamn miserable and ashamed. This hangover lasted all day until about 5 pm. It was easily one of the worst days of my life. I probably threw up 15 times and couldn’t even eat lunch. When my mom came and got me, I got extremely sick in the car and puked out the door. I told my mom I must be carsick because I slept through lunch and hadn’t eaten all day. She took me to a gas station and bought some pepto bismol tablets, after unsuccessfully trying to get me to eat. The medicine helped me to keep from getting too sick on the hour long ride home, but I still felt like absolute shit, physically and emotionally. I was horribly ashamed of myself. When we got home I took a cold shower (the cold seemed to soothe the hangover for some reason) and lay down to watch some television. We got home at around 2:30 pm, so I still felt like shit until around 5. After the hangover diminished, I just felt exhausted for the remainder of the day. That night I went to bed at around 11 pm and slept straight through the night without waking up even once. The next day, I was still ashamed of how I had let it get out of hand, but I also knew that I had gained a new wisdom about alcohol abuse. It can be a great thing, but if I get carried away it can also be an awful time.  [Erowid Note: The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]  Monday 7:30 a.m. I chugged a fifth of vodka and got smashed (normal routine for me)10:00 a.m. I decided to chug another fifth (not routine) and from there I blacked out. Next thing I know it's 5:00 p.m. I went to the liquor cabinet and found it empty. OH SHIT! I had no money left, so I knew what comes next: HELL! I knew it was going to be a rough night, but not like I ever expected. One should know that I haven't touched alcohol since this happened, and I pray for those who still suffer such an affliction.Anyway, I'm sure you heard about pink elephants? Well, it's not true. They are actually demons! HORRIBLE DEMONS!!!!! When the withdrawls began, I began to shake violenly. This was normal for me, considering that I went through it several times before. Then I blacked out again, which I didn't expect. I can only assume that it was a seizure. When I came to, it was around 2:00 a.m. That is when the hallucinations began.I was sitting on the roof of a victorian style house lookin at the ground approx. 3 stories below. Sitting next to me was my fiance. The funny thing is that she died three years prior (I've been drinking non-stop since). She pointed to the lawn below and said, 'You should be down there, Not up here.' After that she transformed into a nightmarish 'THING' that I couldn't possibly describe in words without crying. 'IT' then picked me up and threw me off of the roof. When I fell to the ground, it hurt. It actually happened? Not likely, but when I came out of my delirium, I realised I was wandering around in my neighborhood and there was a huge gash on my head. I had lost alot of blood. I happened to have my cell phone with me, so I called myself an ambulance, in which they treated me for my injury and detoxed me safely with librium.Today I am alcohol free an happy. No one wants to have the thought that your best friend could be dead. But in an instant, what I thought would be a fun date with two other girls turned out to be the most terrifying night of my life. Before that cold October night I never looked at life the same, because I had never had to stare death straight in the face. Nelson is my closest friend who normally has a good head on his shoulders, but like all of us makes mistakes now and then. I met him in kindergarten and we have been brothers ever since. That's why when his life was on the line I gave every thing I had to keep him alive.It all started when I got a call from him one night and he wanted to know if I wanted to go out with him and two sophomore girls that we knew at the time. 'Hell Ya!' I said, like usual. I could always count on Nelson to introduce me to cool girls. So like usual he came with his truck to pick me up, and like usual we both brought a sizeable amount of liquor. But in no way was this night going to be anywhere near usual. 'Are you ready to get messed up tonight, dude!' he screamed as I entered the truck. 'Definitely,' I replied, because at that moment I was ready to get inebriated and have a good time, but if I could of seen the future I would of poured out our bottles and stayed at home. We then headed to pick up the girls at their house. After we got them we spent a couple minutes deciding what to do. I knew of a tree house near some office buildings that people would party at. When we arrived we started to walk into the woods that the tree house was in. I was ready to start drinking when Nelson made a comment to me that I regretfully neglected. 'I'm so ready to get ripped,' I said.'Oh, I’ve already had 10 shots.' He replied. 'No you didn't, you liar.' I joked with him because I had never known him to drink so excessively that quick. We forged our way through the dense woods on the way to the tree. We finally made it there and climbed up the ladder to a wooden platform with handrails on all sides. We all took our seats and I began to swig my vodka down as Nelson began to speak. 'Man, I’m so pissed that football season is over. I can't believe that I’m never going to play again. And I didn't even get the playing time I wanted this season.' I could tell he wasn't being himself as he started to gulp down his raspberry vodka. 'Dude, calm down on that vodka if you've already had 10 shots.' I said. 'Don't worry about me, I'll be fine,' he replied. But I should have worried about him because I knew the dangers of alcohol poisoning and that the stuff is literally a poison and will kill you if too much is consumed. He took a few more swigs and said, 'I'll be right back, I have to go take a piss.' He scaled down the ladder and little did I know that would be the last time he was conscience for the rest of the night. I just kept drinking and talking to the girls when I realized that Nelson was taking longer then he should. I called out to him below but there was nothing but silence. Peering over the edge I could see him laying stomach down amongst the leaves and dirt. I knew something was wrong if he was passed out at 10 o'clock. I tried yelling at him to wake him up, but got no answer. I Then carefully scaled down the ladder and walked up to him. I was disgusted at the site of him pathetically lying in his own urine, so I grabbed his arms and pulled him out to lay him on his side. The girls eventually made there way down to see what all the commotion was all about. They had obviously never witnessed anything like that because I could tell that they were frightened. 'Nelson!' I yelled over and over again in his ear hoping he would regain conciseness. I have known him to be an extremely deep sleeper and wanted to make sure he wasn't just taking a quick snooze so I yelled at the top of my lungs, 'Nelson, if you don't get your ass up right now I’m going to call the paramedics and you will go to the hospital!' When he was still silent after that I knew something had to be done. I spent a good five minutes hollering profanities and punching trees in anger. I knew the only thing I could do was to take him back to his house and deal with his parents. I got a hold of him and tried to lift him off the ground but I had no leverage. 'Grab his arms and sit him up,' I told the girls. Then I threw him over my shoulder. I never realized how heavy a human body can be, especially when it is hanging over your shoulder limp. We slowly cleared our way threw the brush, while I was having an especially hard time maneuvering through the trees carrying that 160 pounds. His weight was just bearing down on me and I collapsed to my knees spilling his body onto the dirt. I couldn’t bear to pick him up again so I began to drag him up the hill to where his car was. I eventually collapsed and started hitting the ground. I was physically and emotionally drained and was obviously in no position to drive. I called my friends Landon and Chris and they drove to the office buildings and started heading down the hill towards us. 'Oh my God, how long has he been like this?' said Chris. 'I'm not sure, he was fine one minute and then just out the next.' I slurred. I was still a little intoxicated even though an incident like this can sober someone up very quickly. Now with three of us we easily lifted him and put him in Landon’s car. After all of the commotion he finally showed a sign of life and began to vomit all over Landon’s back seat. Although I felt sorry for Landon, I was glad to see that Nelson was moving around. The girls got picked up by their friend and Landon drove me in Nelsons truck while Chris chauffeured Nelson. I was mortified when we got to his house. His parents are very strict and his father was not only the leader of our church youth group, but also my Godfather. We went to the front door and rang the doorbell. His mom answered the door and it was well past midnight. The first thing she said was, 'Where is Nelson?' She seemed concerned like she knew something was wrong. 'He had a little to much to drink tonight and he is in Landon‘s car.' I said, trying to soften the blow. We all went out to the car and pulled him out of the backseat. His father was the only thing holding him up while his mom slapped him and yelled for him to wake up, but she was just as unlucky as me in her attempts to awaken him. The only thing left to do was to call an ambulance to take him to the near by hospital. He was now in God’s hands.After a sleepless night watching Nelson’s house and little brother with Chris and Landon, my mom came to pick me up in the morning before they brought him home. I drove with my mom to the scene of the horrific night where I retrieved Nelson’s cell phone, belt, and shoes which had all been strewn about in my struggle to drag him to safety. My mom told me that he was doing fine, but we were lucky that he didn’t pass away. The hospital had to pump out the excessive amounts of vodka and force fed him charcoal to induce vomiting. That long night of terror turned out to be a turning point in my young life. I fully understood that one big mistake can have a greater effect on the people around me then I might think. I felt as if the recreational use of alcohol wasn’t worth the risk if it had the potential to murder my best friend. Nelson is now attending Texas Tech University and is still drinking excessively, which leads me to believe that even when the correct answer to our problems drags us in the dirt and throws us on a stretcher, we never fully learn from our mistakes. I write this story about a rather extreme experience I've had with alcohol last year, at age 17. It was my first experience, and hopefully the most extreme I'll ever experience, because I know if I had drank more i would be dead.It all started at my friend M's house. We were sitting in his basement bored and he asked if I wanted something to drink. Suprisingly, I had never drank before, but decided I would anyway. So he got a bottle of Irish cream and some glasses and we each took a little. It tasted aweful, but I chugged it down easily anyway. We decided to have another. And another. And another. After about 4 we walked up the stairs and noticed we were light headed, and had the famous 'buzz' everyone raves about. So we got some Jack Daniels whiskey and started going at that. Eventually another friend R came in and had a few shots. I kept saying we should stop, but was enthralled by the fact that more felt better. The more I drank, the better and happier and more giggly I felt, and my friends and I kept chanting 'one more.'Soon the rancid acidic taste of the hard liquor vanished and we were chugging out of cups rapidly. We went to get more. I remember walking up the stairs and going to the bathroom and noticing I seemed to have no feet whatsoever. I was flying! Wow that was strange. Tried to piss in my friend M's toilet but urinated all over the seat and wall, but laughed saying to myself that I was so drunk that the urine contained enough alcohol to actually disinfect his bathroom. I nearly fell down the stairs and then decided to run circles around my friends pull table. Then there was a blackout. My friends claimed M and I became so drunk that we stopped drinking out of cups. We just chugged hard liquor right out of the bottle for a while, until I got so drunk that I started pouring it into my eye. In a quest to get more I tried to go upstairs, but ended up falling down the stairs trying to get up. Afterwards I fell into the pull table, and with blood running down my face I ran over, fell over again, and started vomiting. For around 2 hours M and I vomited nearly continuously, constantly choking on pieces of food in our vomit. I had long since stopped responding to any outside stimulation including screaming and slapping. My friends panicked. I was completely unconscious for quite a while. I finally woke up to my friend A jamming his hand down my throat to pull out chewed food I was choking on and bit him and punched him. Eventually the vomiting subsided.I woke up later in a state so miserable I cannot describe it. I've had severe cases of the flu and skipped sleep all night but NOTHING could compare the the feeling the next morning. Immediately upon waking I noticed wiping my face there was dried blood all over it. M's little brother came down to notify me my mother wanted me to come home, but as soon as I looked up I barfed my guts out. Apparently from moving my head fast after nearly drinking myself to death. I dragged myself upstairs to take a crap, only to find crapping also made me vomit. It was wretchedly gross. After somehow getting home I immediately went to sleep. I tried to eat but couldn't I threw up. I tried to drink cause I was very dehydrated, but couldn't I threw up. I couldn't eat until 11:30 that night and that was only half a bagel. It was miserable.Since then I've been drunk plenty of times and smoked plenty of weed, mostly with good outcomes. It comes to show though, if your drinking with your friends in private, just make sure you wait between each drinks and try to stop. I know if I had drank anymore I would have gone into a coma. I basically was in one at the time and would estimate my BAC to probably have been somewhere around .30 I had recently quit using all substances, excluding alcohol and smokeless tobacco. I was sober for about a month and feeling great. Long story short I decided to drink one night with a couple of close friends and my girlfriend at the time. We started off slow, but slowly picked up. We were taking shots left and right, toasting to everything. Soon I was mixing half cups of vodka with half cups of beer and before long I was extremely intoxicated. My tolerance to drugs and alcohol were extremely low as I hadn't been drinking much at all, even before I stopped using illegal substances. Basically what happened is I got drunk and remember being really upset and fearing a panic attack. I left the room we were drinking in for my room where I consumed 1 mg of lorazepam, about 1-2 hours after we started drinking, for which I had a prescription for anxiety. After letting the pills dissolve in my mouth I remember an instant loss of inhibition and a general feeling of 'not giving a shit.' Sometime after consuming the first milligram I took the rest of the bottle for reasons I can't really rationalize. Immediately after taking the rest of the pills, 13.5 total, .5 mg, I completely blacked out. I remember a few other things after this point where I was snapped back into consciousness. The first is when a couple of police officers showed up at my room with paramedics. I don't remember what was said between myself and them, but I remember leaving my building and getting in an ambulance. My roommate who was there when the cops and paramedics were there told me that when I was talking to the police officers and paramedics that I poured out 'the biggest line of snuff tobacco [he] had ever seen.' I apparently made a loud outburst at one officer when he inquired about what I was doing, yelling 'WHAT, this is legal!' I tried doing a line of snuff as big as he claimed the day after and couldn't breathe for a couple of seconds after I insufflated the tobacco. I think if I wasn't that royally fucked up it wouldn't have been possible. I like to think maybe the added stimulation from the snuff could have kept me going enough so that I wouldn't die, but this is just skepticism. I think I may have thrown up in the ambulance, but I am not sure. After that everything faded away into darkness. I woke up once more in the hospital where they were attaching all kinds of wires to me and made me a whole bottle of liquidated charcoal. After this, I slept a long time. I woke up the next day and exited the hospital with no real recollection of what actually happened, but I was told some pretty awful things that I had done when I was under the influence. The first thing was that I assaulted my girlfriend. This is hard for me to deal with because I have no remembrance of the event and I am not a violent person at all. I think the combination of the alcohol and lorazepam did this to me. I strongly urge anyone who is using this prescription drug to not drink while using it. I also learned from friends who were around me while I was intoxicated that I wasn't making any sense with anything I was saying, but that I was really angry and I did not seem to be acting like myself. I didn't know what had happened that night, but was informed the next day upon returning to my building and confronting my girlfriend, who was incredibly scared of me. I regret this experience more than any other drug combination, or drug experience - period.That next day with the mounting stress of criminal charges, which were pressed, I smoked a bowl of some dank marijuana with a good friend of mine and I remember tripping out hard. I assumed the lorazepam was still in my system. My bed was rolling like waves in the ocean and my walls were collapsing around me. I felt like I was going crazy because I remember hearing whole songs in my head. Intricate pieces that I know I have never heard before. It went from classical, to rock; to folk...It was very strange. Shortly after that I passed out and woke up to more police officers at my door, this time with a summons.The moral of my story is simple: don't take lorazepam with alcohol, not even a small dose...It is very dangerous and your personal relationships could and probably will suffer.

I looked at my watch, it read 8:30pm. I was getting off in one hour. My friends and I were planning to get a huge buzz that Friday night. The plan was ingenious, my friends would start at 8:30 at the party location with their shrooms and I was to start at work with DXM. So at the appropriate time I started downing sucrets, which do taste a lot better than cough medicine. Ten minutes later I had finished my pack of 16 and went back to work. BAD IDEA.I was walking around the store when the feeling first started. A feeling that put a spring in my step and a smile on my face. That is until I had to help customers, trip out didn't have meaning to me until that point. They all knew, all of them, how, oh crap how. An hour later I was leaving the store with a bigger smile on my face, it wasn't that I was wacked, just that walking like a robot (one effect of DXM) seemed funny at the time. I could barely contain the joy I felt as I walked home. A big buzz awaited me, and it didn't waste much time once I got there.The first thing I saw after walking in the door was all my friends staring blank faced at a wall in the dark (they had already taken their shrooms).  This seemed strange, but once they had told me that they were looking for a pulse one of them had felt in the wall everything made sense. So once we looked for five minutes, I decided it was time for phase 2. I downed 2 grams of shrooms and started on my 26 ounce bottle of Jack Daniels. This was a great mix, after 2 hours everything started blending together in an intense mix of incoherence. What a great time to snort a few lines of Ritalin my friend said to me. Once my rubber arm was sufficiently twisted....  SNIFF........SNIFF..... and calm and focus descended upon us. We were philosopher kings, it was great until we remembered our weed. So we started rolling while I finished my booze. About 30 minutes and 10 joints later the only thing real to me was the rhythmic tribal sounds of Enigma's 'Eyes of the Truth' blaring in the background. It was there I experienced my first technicolor roller coaster. The coasters cars were powered by the music, powerful tunnels of color and light (imagine stargate on acid) out of body experiences became less frightening as I pulled an 'out of dimension experience'. I felt so peaceful, I had no concept of the world, no cares, no problems, just the struggle to keep from plunging over the side, leaving the roller coaster's car. The big fall, the one you never quite recover from.After 2 blessed hours of this, my friends who were also feeling pretty good at the time decided to dare me to drink a bottle of cough syrup to increase the buzz. More DXM,  I can't...... Ouch.... Ouch.... damn that rubber arm. Gulp gulp gulp gone. I can't tell the story from experience from here on in. Lets just say my friends filled me in the next day. The rest of the night unfolded with my friends watching TV , and for me, well, it was the first time I had ever slept with my eyes open, sitting up in a chair looking at my friends. The only movement I managed was the occasional sigh from my 'SLEEP'.It was a good time all in all. Just remember, if you are going to fall asleep wacked, you might as well keep your eyes open, you never know what you will miss at a party like that. Before I start to retell my experience, I think it is only fair to warn you I am by no means a respected writer. So please, don’t expect and exceptionally written story. Thanks.There is not much to do in my town so most Friday nights me and a couple of good friends usually end up wandering around town all night. Searching desperately for something to occupy ourselves with. This night was shaping up to be the same. I met my good friend Jared on the way to a small playground in which our friends usually assemble before we begin our night of boredom. Jared was looking surprisingly anxious, and after inquiring what was wrong he discretely reveled a bottle of what appeared to be liquor. Surprised and amused I asked him how he had acquired it, then withdrew my question after remembering his parents had a fully stocked liquor cabinet.We arrived at the park early and it was nearly deserted other than a few younger children we didn’t know. Jared took this as an opportunity to begin what he hoped would be a great night by mixing about a half of his flask to a bottle of cola we had just purchased. After adding what he thought to be a reasonable amount to the bottle he joking offered to sell me the remainder, and after several minutes of thinking I accepted and handed him over a five dollar bill. Not sure what to do with it I curiously opened the bottle and took a drink, the foul taste filled my mouth and as I swallowed a burning sensation flowed down my throat and stopped at my stomach. The thought of another sip sickened me so I made up my mind that mixing it with cola was the smarter choice.Slowly my other friends arrived and separated into there small groups of close friends, usually consisting of four or five people. After about fifteen minutes we made the decision to leave the playground with another close friend named Mandie so we could drink without fear of our friends disapproving. Mandie had before that point experimented with alcohol and Marijuana so we trusted her judgment and she became somewhat of a mentor to us during the night.About a ten minute walk from the original playground there was a much larger but significantly less populated playground that Mandie assured us, was the perfect place to begin our drinking. We seated ourselves underneath a jungle jim and began to talk while Jared started vigorously sipping on his bottle. After a couple minutes of discussing it Mandie advised me to quickly drink my liquor and get it over with. I was skeptical about drinking it all, wondering what effect it would have on my body. Eventually curiosity won and I began drinking it down as quickly as possible. I felt the same foul taste and burning sensation growing stronger and more intense than before. I forced the rest of the bottle down and gagged into my hand, my two friends both chuckled at the site. I began to feel a warm euphoria washing over my body which took me by surprise. This was my first buzz on and I didn’t know what to expect, But I liked it :D. After what could have been hours of laughter we decided we should leave our current spot in search of more people, and Mandie ensured us a group of her friends would be hanging out near the graveyard so that was our destination. My first attempt to stand proved exceedingly difficult and I fell, which my Jared found overly amusing. With some help from Mandie I was on my feet, however walking was no simple task either. As we were on our way to the Graveyard a group of her friends drove by us, they stopped and beckoned her over. She left us for a few minutes and returned with a huge smile on her face, motioning me and Jared closer she reviled what seemed to be two homemade cigarettes which I realized were joints soon after.I had had never considered smoking weed before, I always thought drugs were stupid and irresponsible because that’s how I was raised. I reminded myself that I had also never considered drinking and so far this was (to say the least) a fairly pleasant experience. So I somewhat guiltily agreed to smoke with her, and I was soon followed by Jared. She lit the joint and took several puffs before passing it to me, having no experience I took a very large haul and began to cough uncontrollably. Eyes watering I handing the joint to Jared who looked unsure at this point. He managed to take a couple puffs without coughing and passed it to Mandie. She told us to pay attention as she took a quick draw and inhaled the smoke. Following her example with both did the same until our weed supply had diminished and there was nothing left to do but continue our way towards the Graveyard.The onset was very quick, and I began to feel the unfamiliar effects after only 3 minutes. At first I felt a little dizzy but this was shortly followed by a burst of energy and euphoria. I experienced complete lose of memory, and became unaware of my surroundings. This amazing feeling grew more intense as the moments passed and with them they brought a new relentless urge to eat, Mandie deemed these feelings “Munchies” and though it best to stop by a corner store to indulge and relieve our newly demanding pallets. Assorted junk food at hand we continued are seemingly unending journey to reach the graveyard while franticly stuffing our faces. Everything tasted better, as if my taste buds were granted some form of improvement and I was not about to waste it.Eventually we arrived at our destination where we were greeted by a group of people that soon became some new friends of mine. Somewhere in the mist of conversation the topic of what drugs we were on arose and I was pleased to learn that my new acquaintances were experiencing the same thing I was for the first time.It got late and members of our group began to leave for the night. I thanked Mandie for a great night and said my goodbyes before embarking with Jared on the journey home. As we neared our homes and our buzzes had all but evaporated we started to reminisce about the amazing feelings that we had so vividly experienced only hours before. Which now felt like a distant memory. This year of my life was one that I am not particularly proud of.  It wasn't that I was completely addicted to drugs, I don't mess around with really hard drugs like Oxy's, Heroine, Meth, etc., but have only experimented with other harder drugs before.  I just felt the need to be high all the time just so I could function on a normal level.  I was in college and was experimenting with a spectrum of drugs, but focused my drug use mostly towards weed and alcohol.  I wasn't happy with college-life at the school I was attending so I would go home every chance that I could.  I later realized I was suffering from depression.  It was about spring time when this incident occured and I was on the verge of dropping out of college.  I didn't care about myself or anyone else, which is why I stayed fucked up all the time.  A friend of mine in my home town had been perscribed 1 mg xanax, which I had only used a few time before, and being a good friend, he handed these out to my social circle like candy.  We would normally consume his 60 mg perscription in a weekend.(6:30pm) I soon found out while searching for cough drops in my mothers night stand that she also was perscribed .5mg xanax but didn't take them.  I took 4 of these out of her perscription and took them orally before I went out.  I met up with two buddies of mine at a park, one being the xanax guy, to smoke a little bit of weed and all three of us took one xanax.  They left their cars at this park after we got high and took off for my friends house for a small gathering, which would later be a mistake.  (7:30) We stopped off at the liquor store to begin our night of fogginess. By this time the weed and 3mg of xanax made me feel euphoric and I now wanted to party hard that night. My friend and I split a fifth of Jack Daniels, which doesn't seem like much, but I was 20 at the time and that was enough to get me pretty drunk without pills, and the guy who was perscribed the pills bought a pint of Jack for himself.  We arrived over my friends house a little later and started our weekly tradition of getting shit-faced drunk.(8:30 pm) The following is my last clear memory.  I made my first drink, a Jack and Coke, moderately strong, and chased it with two 1 mg xanax my friend gave to me.  (3:30 pm Next Day) The next thing I knew, I woke up at my dad's house, who I don't even live with and is a cop, passed out on a couch in his basement.  You may think I cut a lot of this story, well that is exactly what happened in my mind.  But let me fill you in with what I have been told by others actually happened.  Apparently, some girls came over and were drinking with us, one of whom eventually became a long term girlfriend months later.  She had asked me once if I remembered meeting her that night, but I denied that she was even there, until a friend showed me pictures of her right near me.  Apparently we talked for almost an hour.  Around 10:00pm, I was told we were doing lines of xanax off the host computer desk, 2 lines, 1mg per line, per person.  Around 11:00 pm, we lined up six shot glasses and the two friends I originally showed up with did two shots of whiskey, back to back, per person, each with a 1mg xanax in each shot. This is about when my two other friends blacked out, so god only knows how many more we consumed after that.  I will tell you one thing, about half of that bottle of 60 disappeared that night, not entirely sure who took the most, and we finished all the liquor. Shortly after this is was when I passed out on the host's bed.  I was apparently woken up by one of my buddies who I did all xanax with and had the good sense to get in a car with me to go home.  I have no recollection of being in a car, let alone operating one, which still to this day is one of the biggest regrets of my life. So in total, I lost 19 hours of memory.  The guys who I drove to this party, forgot they left their cars at the park and spent 3 hours looking around town for them the next morning.  When I awoke, I went outside only to find my car parked in my fathers driveway.  I felt so ashamed to know that I not only risked my life, but the life of my friends, especially since I knew someone who died from being involved in a fatal crash because he was in a car with someone who was doing the same thing I was.  Even though my friends and I joke about 'The Night That Never Happened', it ended up being a life changing event for me.  I swore off xanax for the rest of my life and vowed to never allow that happen to me again, because of it ability to throw any rational thought out the window.  Even though I still drink a lot and only mess around with drugs very occasionally, I always keep the two separate. This event led to a gradual decrease in my drug use, and life has been much better without them running my life.Ironically, I have been perscribed xanax for an anxiety disorder recently, but use it only as perscribed and in low doses.  If I go out drinking, the pills don't leave the bottle.  When not abused, xanax is actually a very helpful drug to those who need it. Luckily, I learned a great lesson from this blackout, but in reality, I might not have been so lucky. I wanted to experiment with nutmeg, as I have taken it a few times but haven't had any breakthrough experiences. I ingested about 0.5 oz. of nutmeg at 1:30 pm and it took me about 30 minutes to consume it all. I knew it was going to take several hours to hit the plateau, so I just went to class and waited. I ate 9 H.B. Woodrose seeds about 3 hours later, at 5 pm.  I was attempting to get both of the highs at exactly the same time, and let me tell you, I did. It must have been around 8:30 or a little while earlier when I noticed effects that I never have on any other drug, granted I haven't taken any psychedelics before. I was sitting at my desk and I noticed that the peoples' voices in the hallway stated to sound strange. They sounded distant and distorted, not to mention that the voices sounded much louder. A few minutes later, they sounded all jumbled up and I couldn't make out any single person as it was just a bunch of noise resembling people.Having this be a new experience for me, I got scared and really started tripping. At this point I lied on my bed and closed my eyes. Immediately I noticed my CEV’s, a series of rainbow colored fractals and other random shapes with the same color pattern, like looking through a kaleidoscope. I opened my eyes and noticed that very similar OEV’s were taking place as well, although they would become stronger later. They were not overpowering but they were very cool. Although I was still worried and skeptical of what was to come, I tried to relax, but things were just too foreign for me and I freaked out. I got off my bed and I was bombarded with such profound thoughts about myself and my life, “what have I done,” “what kind of person am I,” “what if I die.” All very serious questions that made me terribly uneasy and more scared. I remember reading similar reports with psychedelics, so I eventually was able to overcome my fears. To help calm myself down, I turned on some music, and I was immediately aware how high I was.I began listening to The Dark Side of the Moon first, and it was obviously playing much slower than usual, telling me that I was very high. I was wondering what would make the experience even stronger when I noticed my synesthesia. I had also read about this happening very frequently with psychedelics and it was then that which told me that I was officially “tripping.” I got very excited and upbeat because I had always to trip but I could never get my hands on acid. The first thing I noticed was that I could “see” the music, mostly in the form of the fractals and colorful shapes I had noticed earlier. I really saw I had visual hallucinations because I was watching South Park on tv and the characters were out of focus, blurry, or otherwise distorted. This was overwhelming for me so I turned off the tv. I now realize that watching the tv or a movie probably would have been very rewarding, so I want to try it next time I trip. I returned to my computer desk and tried to type to my friends, but the trails and visuals were too strong. The trails were so strong that I remember looking at my hands while typing and it was just a big blur of trails. It looked like special effects from a movie. This was one of the coolest moments of the night. I looked at the screen and it appeared to be magnified and coming out at me, also a very cool effect. I gave up typing because I really wanted to enjoy my trip and relax. Now that I was completely into the trip, I put Pink Floyd back on and this time it was even slower. It seemed like it may stop completely if I was any higher (and it almost did!) I then decided to grab some beers to see if they would multiply my trip. I was dehydrated from the nutmeg so drinking beer on top probably was dangerous (I was drinking water too). I noticed that because of the synesthesia I couldn’t taste the beer or feel the burden of the carbonation. Therefore I was able to drink the beers fast and without problem. They hit me hard but enjoyably and greatly multiplied the high. The music sounded as great as ever and very rich and deep. All this while the OEV’s were continuing to occur. Another note about the synesthesia: I noticed that I couldn’t feel or hear myself breathe, but rather I could only hear a strange whistle or buzzing noise each time I inhaled. It sounds crazy, but it was very entertaining at the time. Four beers later I was the highest I’ve ever been in my entire life. The trip is so smooth and enjoyable now. I put on St. Pepper’s and sit down to play Mario Kart next. The game was highly enjoyable and it seemed to be playing in slow motion. After playing it for some time, I decided to go back strictly to music. I sat at my desk and listened to another CD or two.I began to get very tired and I lied down in bed with Pink Floyd’s Animals playing. I must have fallen asleep sometime soon after lying down. Although it seems that I went to bed prematurely, the trip itself had worn off considerably and the psychedelic effects were all but gone. I was still very high from the nutmeg and the seeds had a lingering buzz that was enjoyable. I was able to sleep only for short periods of time all the next morning, but I wasn’t too tired the next day. When I woke up I had a terrible ringing in my ears and a faint heartbeat, both of which worried me somewhat. I got up to get water and I noticed that I had blurry vision and the lights were so overwhelming in the hall that I almost blacked out. I could feel and see myself starting to slip into unconsciousness so I closed my eyes, grabbed a gulp of water, and quickly made my way back to my room to lie down.I drank a lot of water the next day and I quickly felt better, leading me to believe that if I had drank a lot of water during the trip I most likely would have no ill effects the next day. I have told all of my friends about my experience and I already have some people that want to trip with me soon. This makes me very happy. I plan on upping the dosage of both the nutmeg and the seeds for the next trip, hopefully wielding stronger results. Happy Tripping! The misinformation on henbane has gotten really bad. If you’re looking for a crazy, LSD high, FORGET IT.Let me start by saying that my family has been using henbane in hombrewing for hundreds of years, and the reports one reads on the Internet about its deadly effects are ridiculously overstated. My grandfather drank Pilsenkraut-spiked beer and whiskey his whole life, and was never seriously affected, other than the mild “nonsense-speaking” effects that the weed can have once it really grabs onto someone. That probably sounds terrible, but it’s harmless, and can be profound.My mother’s family is “Karpatendeutsch,” meaning Germans from Slovakia and Transylvania. “Pilsner” is originally simply beer made with henbane instead of hops or henbane mixed with hops. I brew it regularly, drink it regularly and am not a babbling “shaman” or smelly hippie. Let me tell you how we make it, first. 5 gallons of clean, non-chlorinated water7 pounds of fermentable malt extract, available at brewing supply storesAbout 1 ½ ounces henbane leaf and flower, dried1 ounce of hops to tasteYeast (I recommend Munton’s Ale)Boil water, add malt, boil malt together with hops for one hour.Using a separate tea-bag infuser, add the henbane about 15 minutes before the end of the boil. Leave the henbane infuser in as the beer cools. Take the infuser out when beer is 80 degrees, add yeast and ferment somewhere dark and cool. Read up on brewing elsewhere, as cleanliness is essential.Prime, bottle and age about a month. Drink at about 55 degrees. With all that out of the way, let me say that drinking more than six beers or so may indeed be dangerous. I don’t know, as the beer is so filling and the taste so strong (kind of like an earthy licorice) that I don’t think anyone I know has ever downed more than six beers. If someone reads this and drinks 15 real Pilseners and dies, that sounds like karma to me. So everything in moderation, huh kids?Here are some effects I notice from Pilsener. I had a few just last night while barbecuing.1.Time becomes a bit strange. For example, grilling chicken can be a long and tedious wait, trying to cook the meat evenly through; before I knew it, the meat was perfectly done and it seemed like the meat had only been on the grill for ten seconds, even though it was about 40 minutes.2.Vision can become a bit weird, too. Photographs may look very detailed or deeply shadowed, almost 3-D. People can look like they are made of rubber or latex. 3.I have to be careful what I do when I have Pilsener in my belly as my pain threshold goes through the roof; I can hurt myself badly and not feel it for hours. No power tools!4.If I really push it and start getting to the 6 or 7 beer range, I can get a little delirious. My wife told me I once wandered around the house, wetting towels and telling her we had to get our daughter’s fever down. My little girl was not sick at the time and I don’t remember the episode.5.Henbane can give me terrible, horrifying nightmares if I eat too much while I drink it. These are nightmares that will haunt you, buddy, so be careful. After a few beers (and a bowl of cereal) I once dreamt that my dead next door neighbor was trying to get into my house after clawing her way out of the grave; I have never forgotten what a gruesome dream it was. If you drink Pilsenser, DO NOT EAT BEFORE BEDTIME.6.The hangover from overdoing Pilsener includes diarrhea, muscle aches and cramps and a headache that will make me suicidal. Okay. So that all sounds bad. But Pilsener is a sometimes thing that can be a lot of fun and can be VERY relaxing. It’s especially good on cold, holiday nights with lots of pretty tree lights and carols. I don’t drink more than three in one evening and I don’t do it more than a couple times a month. I consider it a part of my ethnic heritage, and I enjoy the taste.I hesitate to mention it, but henbane leaves can be steeped in hard liquor for a few days to get the same effects. Just be careful as the effects are stronger and it takes FAR, FAR, FAR less of this alcohol to give the effects. Add about ¼ ounce to a bottle of vodka and leave it alone for a few weeks. Then have a shot or two. DO NOT OVERDO IT.That’s the mantra for henbane: DO NOT OVERDO IT. You’ll be sorry if you do. Alcohol is an insidious, life-destroying drug. The culture of booze is integrated and pervasive. ‘Nuff said.My own experience with alcohol is like many others, I won’t bore you with the build up, suffice to say I was a weekend drinker, social drinker, for many years, starting in my twenties until my mid forties. I never considered it a problem, I saw others with problems, even saw a friend drink himself to death. It didn’t hit home because, “that wasn’t me”, I didn’t have that kind of problem.The final trip, which really killed my love affair with booze, and nearly killed me, started off normally: A weekend drinking. Nothing too heavy, but I continued to drink, everyday, getting to a certain point, maybe half in the bag. Once or twice fairly drunk, this continued for about ten days or so. By this time, with my years of abuse, it took quite a bit to get half in the bag, and a lot to get drunk. I was aware that something was wrong, I hadn’t been to work in days, I told myself to stop, but I couldn’t wean myself off. It just went on. Finally, I started to get scared, which made me drink more. I knew I couldn’t go to work smelling like I did. I tried to stop, but encountered fierce withdrawal, finally I woke up one morning and my eyes were almost swollen shut, and I was terrified. I had to do something, so I called my employer, spilled my guts and checked into a rehab. It took hours to get in, at which point I was shaking badly, and on the verge of freaking out completely. I finally got in, and was given a Valium “for my blood pressure”. I was assigned a bed, and I laid down to sleep, and I felt that everything would be alright. I couldn’t have been more mistaken. I was jolted from a deep sleep by pure, crystalline, heart stopping panic. I had been asleep for maybe an hour, and no trace of the Valium remained. (I later learned that elevated liver enzymes can burn through sedatives in a flash) I am emetophobic, and I felt like I was going to die.  I found out that the nurses were not going to keep giving me Valium, and so I gritted my teeth and hung on. I hallucinated, I stopped breathing, I couldn’t sleep for fear my apnea would cause me to die in my sleep, I sweated, I hallucinated some more. Horrible, mind-tearing visual and tactile hallucinations. I would fall asleep, and wake up screaming, my heart pounding in my chest. I was convinced that wild dogs were in the room, trying to tear me apart. At this point, seizures were a very real danger. I begged them to give me something, anything. Nothing. Not even a tums. Acid reflux was burning up my throat, my diarrhoea was so bad, bile was running out of me, burning my ass. All the while, the terrible fear. After six or eight hours of this, I couldn’t take it anymore. I checked myself out against their advice, signed a release, and got the hell out of there. The moaning, zombie like inmates, shuffling around, or puking blood in the washrooms, the worst smell I had ever smelt in my life. All my senses ridiculously heightened, smell, hearing, touch. If a mouse farted it would blast me out of a stupor.Once outside, I breathed the fresh air, and felt a bit better. I discovered that walking, mile after mile, feet in agony, back muscles spasming, was a good therapy, especially for the panic. On and on. The hospital was ten miles away. I walked there. Waited in the ER for another eternity. Couldn’t get in. Walked home, maybe another five miles. Tried to lay down, trembling, awful terror, hallucinated that there were worms in my veins. I felt like I had to crush the bulging veins to kill them. On and on, fell asleep briefly near dawn, felt that the worst was over. It wasn’t. Terrified all the next day, walked all over the city, trying to find someone to help me, a counsellor, a priest, anything. It was Good Friday and I walked to a large church. It was closed, I fell down and started crying on the sidewalk. I’m not religious, but at that moment I prayed to God to help give me strength. I was a dirty, smelly, outcast, and fortunately there weren’t a lot of people around. I saw a notice for a clinic several miles away and walked there. I was completely exhausted, and looked right at home with the street people in the waiting room. The mosaic tile on the floor looked like devil faces and tormented souls writhing in agony. I held on to a thread  of sanity, I was ready to just step in front of a bus or train. Finally a doc saw me, and gave me some electrolytes and some Ativan, and maybe Librium, can’t remember. I told them I was suicidal, and a shrink saw me, I was sobbing like a child, and then the drugs took hold and I could pass out in an instant, but the slightest noise would wake me. Back in the waiting room. Back to see another counsellor, Drug addiction counselling. Help numbers, a leaflet on AA, and other groups. I felt so grateful. I walked home, spent three more days of rampant panic attacks, made almost bearable by the pills, and then the emotional and financial fallout. I was an emotional basket case for weeks afterward, and I should mention here that my employer was life-saving. They had put me on sick leave, and welcomed me back, and told no one. This act of kindness still makes me teary, I can’t imagine what would have happened if I had lost my job.The stupidity of alcoholism didn’t end there. I did this twice more. Finally, I killed it. My romance with this seductive, deadly poison was over. I no longer crave it, or even feel any temptation or loss of social connection. It took me years to get to this point, but once I got there, it accelerated rapidly, it totally blind-sided me.  I don’t care what anyone else does, I don’t preach.  If you want to drink, drink. Not me brother, I’ve had it. I had my fun and my distress a while back with cocaine, and have come to respect both the fun and distress that inevitably accompanies it. After doing a bit of research on coca, and after finding that natural coca does not carry the same dangers as refined cocaine, I went on ebay and bought a box of 100g Windsor Mate de Coca for $20. In the two week wait that followed, I did a bit more research on cocaine pharmacology and found that cocaine, in the presence of alcohol, forms another psychoactive compound in the liver and kidneys: cocaethylene. More research on cocaethylene revealed that the effects are more profound per milligram dosage, and also much longer lasting, as well as producing a slightly different high. More research revealed that 2g of coca leaf per ounce of wine would yield 4-8 milligrams of cocaine per ounce of wine. It is important to note here that street cocaine is often very adulterated (cut), so while 250 to 300 milligrams does not sound like much, it is probably the equivalent of .5-1 gram of common street cocaine. Once I finally received the Windsor, I got a 1.5 liter bottle of Carlo Rossi and went to work!My main interest in this experiment was to see if there was some way to avoid all the pain of “the day after”. I saved 25 of the 1-gram tea bags in case there was a bad come down, to see if drinking the tea would ease the pain of cocaine withdrawal. 75 1-gram tea bags were placed in a Tupperware pitcher, and immersed in wine, soaked for 2-3 hours, and then the fun began! Note that is a little less than 2g/ounce of wine as stated above; it converts to 1.5g/ounce.1600- I drink the first glass wine. No detectable change.1630- I drink the second glass of wine. No change.1715- I drink a third glass. No change, I started thinking maybe the tea was de-cocainized, but also note that I would normally be feeling a buzz from three drinks, and I really felt sober like I hadn’t been drinking at all.1800- I decided to grab a bunch of the soaked teabags, and squeeze the wine out of them and into my glass over the pitcher to avoid spilling. I drink the fourth glass.1810- Bang-Zoom! Feeling Good! I got to thinking that I had always heard of coca leaves being chewed, and I believe part of the extraction process of cocaine uses a press. I have to say, there was a definite difference, and anyone who would attempt to make Vin Mariani, should definitely find a way to squeeze or press the leaves or teabags to get all the active ingredients out. There is a plethora of possible explanations for why this is, and I cannot definitively explain it at this time, but the squeezing or pressing of the soaked leaves or teabags is a definite must.2030-the next morning: From here on out I sponged up the wine with the teabags and squeezed out glasses of Vin Mariani. Definitely a good high. Far more subtle than snorting cocaine, and at the same time still intense. A very smooth up, a very steady high and a very smooth comedown. The roller coaster of sniffing coke every 45 minutes or so was nonexistent. The sexual arousal that accompanies cocaine (“Woe to you my princess…”) was present, goose bumps, elevated body temperature and heart rate were also present. The subtlety of the Vin Mariani I would attribute to the route of ingestion as well as the presence of the other cocaine-related alkaloids that naturally occur in the coca leaf. Nature put together the coca leaf, and I have no doubt that by extracting and isolating only the cocaine, you are essentially removing many helpful and desirable compounds.There was no dramatic crash or comedown, but sleep initially proved difficult. There was no intense Jones after awaking or in the days that followed, but there was a desire to do it again. Still a very successful experiment, and the teabags I saved to ease the Jones were unnecessary. The Vin Mariani is by far the best way I’ve found to enjoy cocaine, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes to use cocaine but doesn’t want all negative side effects, high cost, or frequent administrations that accompany powdered cocaine use. I would still say that despite the fact that this is definitely a less addictive way to use cocaine, the potential is still there for abuse. I have to add a warning of great importance: In my research leading up to this experience I found that in cocaine related deaths, high levels of cocaethylene often accompanied heart failure. I drank the bottle I made over the course of 14 hours, and it had the equivalent of half a gram of street cocaine.To summarize, a Vin Mariani preparation of cocaine is far superior to any other way I’ve heard of or tried, because of the lack of the typical side effects and normal addictive properties associated with cocaine. The recipe I will stick with is 100g coca leaf to 1.5 liters of wine, soaked and pressed. A great advantage is the ol’ piggy-piggy-oink-oinks would have no way to distinguish Vin Mariani from regular wine without testing or drinking it. Also, coca leaf is relatively cheap compared to street cocaine, and will not be adulterated by any of the nasty stuff people put into coke to cut it (like meth, yuck!). Before I start on that experience I want to say a few things about the state of life I was in at that time. I was in a lot of stress because I rented my original room to a subtenant because I couldn’t stand to live in that flat share anymore (too much annoying people, always on drugs, very noisy & dirty, eating my food away etc.). This guy paid me a rent once and then never again. But I couldn’t get him out legally and without using violence which I am totally opposed of, so I had to pay his rent, the rent for my one room apartment I was living in and a huge debt I owned to a friend. I managed this by having five jobs at once (bar keeper, waiter, stage hand, cook and managing the logistics in a club).That meant I didn’t have much time for sleeping so Speed was the answer. I used up to 5 grams per week and lots of alcohol to keep my mood swinging, sometimes not sleeping for about 3-4 days. I was totally stressed out, lonely and frustrated at that time. It was the worst period of my life so far. During that period I got close to a colleague from work – let’s call him C - that was a really nice guy but a heavy coke user. He developed a real addictive usage with using up to 2 grams in one evening all alone in his apartment. I always wondered how he managed to pay for all this. I never really liked coke but he always offered me some for free and of course I never said no.At one point I had to move back to my mother’s (at the age of 24!) feeling like a total loser, ashamed of me and just wanting to get my shit together. When this experience took place she was on a one week vacation. I came home after work and was drunk. I still had some beers and some vodka so I drunk even more. In my binge that crazy idea of having a huge amount of coke at once came into my head. It was 5am but I called C and asked him if I can come over. He agreed so I went out. I arrived at his place and I told him about my plan and asked him if he had some coke to sell. He had some and I purchased ½ gram for 50 Deutschmarks. I made one line out of all of it and snorted it nasally. It really kicked in, made me feel sober from alcohol at once and gave me a nice nervous euphoria that lasted for about an hour. Damn coke, it’s always a fake, not lasting a bit. I was disappointed because I expected to have a real coke trip like I had my first times, but what the heck. My friend was with his girl friend and she had some Salvia Divinorum with her. I had tried that before and always found it quite pleasing so I suggested to smoke some. They agreed. C put some in a bowl handing it to me. I smoked without reflecting any further. Just a few seconds later I had a strange feeling of splitting up. It was as if my whole body and consciousness were departed in the middle and each half relocated itself from the other. It was a real physical and awkward feeling, my left side seemed to be like 10 centimeters more to the front than my right side (I guess in reality I was just squinting). Furthermore I totally forgot that I had smoked Salvia and suddenly I wasn’t sure why I was here with them anymore. I felt that I was on some kind of psychedelic and I was quite paranoid, too. I had a cup of tea before and I blamed them that they had put me some LSD in it to make fun out of me. Of course they denied it but I was totally convinced. I just couldn’t stand their company anymore so I made an excuse to have to go to the toilet.There I was sitting now with my pants dropped but without peeing or anything else. I just put my head into my hands and tried to relax my psyche. After ten minutes the feeling decreased and I felt ready to go out again. As I closed the door to the bathroom I remembered again that I had been smoking Salvia and that that was the reason for my strange feeling. I suddenly realized my strange behavior and I laughed my ass of with my friends who have been really worried about my – what they called – psychotic behavior. This has been years ago and I never smoked Salvia again. I guess that bad feeling was after all just a result of my bad overall feeling about life that I had at that time combined with the synergy of coke and alcohol, two drugs I usually wouldn’t combine with psychedelics. But it really scared me because it was the first and so far only time that I really lost control over my power of judgment. I’ve been on some weird trips on acid and shrooms before but no matter how strange or scary it became, I always knew where I was and what I was on. I am prescribed .5 mg of lorazepam two times a day for anxiety along with 20 mg of paxil once a day for anxiety/depression. When this experience occured, I am just refilled my prescription for lorazepam; I had been without it for at least 4 weeks. I was taking Paxil as prescribed.On this Friday, I had taken .5 mg of lorazepam in the morning as prescribed. I drank two glasses of wine, and my memory begins to go hazy after just that small amount of alcohol. I went grocery shopping, came home and made dinner for my roomate, Sam, and I. We drank several shots and mixed drinks after dinner and were playing cards when two guys in our apartment complex stopped by and invited us to a party. At the time, I did not feel all that drunk, but looking back, I barely remember getting ready to go out. Sam and I went to the guy's apartment, where I had a beer or two, and then to the party. I do not remember being in either place. My memory completely cuts off at this point, so all the following actions have been pieced together from what people told me. I was very happy and excited about going to the party, but when I was there, I became more and more upset and angry. I don't think there was any real reason to be angry, but apparently I was mad at Sam. I felt like she was abandoning me and was mad that she was having such a good time. Apparently, I stormed out of the party early on. One of the guys came outside to see what was wrong and saw me storming off in the wrong direction. He tried to help me, but I cursed at him and gave him the finger. I walked back to my apartment, but could not find the keys to get in. I called Sam and she came to let me in. She said I was sitting by the door with my knees to my chest and still acted angry and rude when she arrived. She went back out, refusing to deal with my drunken moodiness.Somehow, I must have fallen on something and hit my eye. I had a black eye with cuts and scrapes around it the next morning. Sam says I called her and screamed that my eye was bleeding 'from the top and the bottom'. I wanted her to come home and must have grown even more angry when she refused or did not offer to. I called my boyfriend and told him the same thing. I was screaming, 'What am I supposed to do? My eye is bleeding and Sam is not here!' He tried to calm me down and thought that he had done so. Sometime shortly after I threw my cell phone at the wall repeatedly until it proke into many pieces. I also more or less trashed our apartment. I knocked over a vase of flowers, threw things all over my room, went in Sams room and tried to rip up our high school year book, threw some of her things around, etc. I then swallowed the rest of my lorazepam pills, which was approximately 55 .5 mg pills. I left the empty bottle on my floor. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I got into my car and drove. I don't know where I was headed, but I have a vague thought that I may have been going to Ocean City. I do not remember any of that. I have a vague image in my mind of my broken phone and the feeling of the pills in my mouth (I swallowed them all at once as they are very small) but that is it. I don't even know why I was so angry. It was rage, really, the most intense kind. I woke up slowly to the sound of Joni Mitchell playing on my CD player in my car. I had the seat reclined and had been asleep on the side of the road for about 5 hours. Upon waking, I did not have any clear emotions. I simply tried to start my car, and upon finding that it would not start, I got out and looked around. It must have been about 5:30 or 6am. The only thing I noticed was a Royal Farms, which I walked towards.It was raining intensly, but I hardly seemed to notice. I lit a cigarette that I found on the seat next to me, along with my smashed cell phone, but it kept going out b/c of the rain. I walked into the Royal Farms briefly, but didn't really have any business in there. I went outside, found 50 cents, and called Sam on the pay phone. She was drunk and said she had been worried sick about me. We got cut off. I had no more cash or change, so I started walking. I had no idea where I was. It could have been Ocean City for all I knew, but I was very calm, not really comprehending the situation. A man in a car stopped and offered to drive me home. I agreed, although normally I would be wary of that. I was only about 5 minutes from the apartment. He dropped me off and I entered the apartment. I stopped, stunned, as soon as I walked in the door. I saw the huge mess and started crying. I knew that I had done it, but I did not remember. It was as if some monster inside me had taken over. I felt horribly guilty. I went into my room and saw the empty pill bottle. That is when I realized that I had taken the lorazepam. Before, I did not remember. Sam was on the couch and I crawled up next to her. We just laid there together and cried hysterically. I cried that I was so so sorry. She said it didn't matter, just that I was ok.The next day we drove around and found my car. It was parked along a residential street that I had never been too. The next few days I struggled to come to terms with what I had done. I have never in my life been suicidal and I wondered if it was suicide I had in mind when I took all those pills. It still feels like it was not me that went into that rage. I am amazed at how severely a normal dose of my medication affected me when combined with alcohol. I am lucky to have friends who understood and forgave me for such behavior. When I was 16 my parents died in a car accident and I was sent to go live with my Grandparents. I was from the city my grandparents lived about 2 hours away in a town of 5000 people.  The whole town was very church oriented and very closed minded. My Brother wanted to take care of me and have me live with him but my grandparents said no and thought it best if I finish school out there.  My brother was a drug dealer, he stopped going to school when he was 16 and moved out and sold drugs full time. He smokes more pot than any guy I have ever met. At the time I moved he sold E, Coke and Weed. He new tons of people and could get anything whenever I would ask him. He had a nice apartment and a 300zxTT all from selling drugs, plus he paid all his bills and lived well.I never liked white drugs I always thought the whole idea was kinda stupid, I never tried them and never wanted to I stuck to pot, acid, E and getting drunk. I started going to high school there and I hated it, everybody was way into big trucks, chewing tobbaco and going to rodeos. Needless to say a stoner kid from the city driving a Ford Probe with big rims was not very accepted. I was not sad about my parents really, I smoked alot of pot and did E alot to ease the pain. I just kicked it for a few weeks and didn't talk to anyone, then I met Kendal, a girl that changed my life. Kendel was short and was beautiful, she had the hotest body, dark hair to her back and sexy blue eyes. But best off all she smoked weed and she had friends. She introduced me to them and we started to hang out. They Smoked really bad pot, it was brown and it took about 4 bowls for me to kinda get stoned, and they all got it from the same guy. One night I took 3 pills and went for a walk, I thought about my parents, how I missed my old friends, and Kendal, I came up with two conclusions, one, everything happens for a reason, so there is no use being sad over them and second, I needed to start selling Drugs to these people.I called my brother and got hooked up with a Quarter Pound of chronic, I made 2.5 gram bags and sold them for 45 dollars a piece. At first I only sold about a bag a day to my friends I had made. Then the weekend came and my cell phone would not stop ringing. I sold the QP by Saturday night. I went to school and people I didn't know were coming up to me and asking me for bags. I skipped school the next day and went to see my brother I bought a half pound and went back. I sold the pot fast and since I was pushing chump bags and got hooked up cheap I made a killing. In about 2 months I had the whole school smoking bud. I would buy E about once every two weeks and sell it to. I would sell it for 30 bucks a hit and kids loved that too. At school I was the man and me and Kendal started going out.I sold drugs all though the year and smoked alot of pot but I did okay in school. I was making so much money, I would never know how much I had, I would put on pants sometimes and find a couple hundred bucks and I wouldn't know were it came from. I would skip school and go to nice resturants with Kendal. I would go shopping all the time, I would buy tons of CD's, clothes, sterio stuff and whatever else. I sold my probe and bought a Eclipse GSX and put alot of money into it making it fast. Everything was cool until people in town started doing meth, I didn't care and I was still making tons of cash but my friends kinda started becoming tweakers. I told my brother and he said I should start selling that too. I accepted and when I went to meet him he told me how to measure it what to sell it for and how much money I should have when I am done. He also gave me some coke to sell. Once again I was the man with the good drugs. I didn't like selling tweak, people would call me at all hours of the day and always want fronts. And to be honest my best customers for it were scumbags. The coke didn't really sell that well at all, I had about 2 8balls and I went to a party with Kendal and I just started giving people lines.  I would give them a line and give them a little bit, when I left I had no coke and by the next day a bunch of people wanted it.  I said the hell with meth and started just selling coke and weed all the time.Now I must say Coke is the coolest drug around to sell. I would get expensive jewelry from girls and sterios from people. I got a pool table from a guy for a gram, I got a piano from a woman for 3 grams and one time 2 girls let me and a friend watch them have sex with each other for a couple lines. Kendal started doing coke alot I would just smoke weed and drink. E started to loose it magic and the happy blissful feelings just started to feel plastic. I would give Kendal coke most of the time and I notice she slowly got weird. It was summer and she would go to work get off, come find me and not leave my site until she would have to go home or she would stay at my house and sleep with me. When I would ask her about it I she would say she loved me and didn't want to miss a moment with me. After that I kinda got scared and told her she was cut off. She cried alot and said the reason I was doing this to her is cause I didn't love her.We didn't talk for about 6 months and I just sold drugs and hung out with my only friend who wasn't a tweeker. One day he said he heard that Kendal was shooting coke. I didn't believe it and about 2 weeks later we went back to school for our senior year. I kinda didn't sell as much coke because my grandma kept asking why people were coming to the pool house (were I slept) at 4 in the morning and leaving in 5 min. But I would still sell it to some people and I always had some for my friends, I still sold pot like mad, but I made my bags bigger and people were happier.  On the first day of my senior year I saw Kendal and she looked bad, her eyes were all sunken in and she looked like she hadn't slept in days. She came and gave me a hug and when I put my arms around her, I could feel all here bones in her back, she was wasting away. If that was enough to make the day real bad at 2nd period I got called to the office and was told the principal wanted to talk to me. I went in his office and he told me to sit down and not talk. He told me he new what I had been through and what my story was. Then he said 'and that dosen't give you an exscuse to do what I do, and if he ever cought me selling drugs to his students at school he would make sure I payed.'He also said that he didn't care what I did out of his school and maybe it would be best if I finished school at the Community college and that I could still walk with my class. I left school that day and never went back, I got all my credits in about 3 months and I didn't even want to walk with my class, for the rest of the school year I just sold pot.In May my brother called me and said he had a good deal on some acid, and that for 150 bucks I could make some quick money. I bought 3 sheets of acid for 150 bucks and sold them all in one night. That is 300 hits of acid and I sold them for 4 dollars a piece, that is 1200 dollars I made in one night. Throught the year Kendal just became a tweaker I would see her about once a week and she would come and buy a 20 sack from me. She just looked worse and worse.On June 13th I woke up on my couch with no clue I would remember that day forever. My buddy stayed over and he was making breakfast. We had had a hard night of drinking and I felt like I was hit by A truck.  I was drinking a red bull to wake up and smoking a bowl and my brother called, and told me that he wrecked his car and that he was in LA and that he was in jail for a DUI, wreckless driving, driving while suspended and possesion of weed. He said if I came there and bailed him out he would pay me back and give me 5 grand. He said he needed 15 grand and LA was a long way away. I told him sure and I would be there as quick as I could. I went to the bank and I got some money to get gas and have some money for the road. I had to stop selling drugs soon I knew and I was going to quite in the end of the summer and I was going to move into my brothers apartment back in the city. I checked my bank statement and it read 54 thousand dollars. I never thought of myself as a dealer until then. In 2 and a half years I put 54k in the bank, bought a cool car and a bunch of bad ass stuff. I could not tell you how much I made all together. I never would have made it all without my brother, or if it wasen't for the town I lived in. On the way to get my brother my phone rang, it was Kendal's mom and she was crying.  I asked what was wrong thinking that she probebly didn't come home or they had a fight. And all I heard her say was 'I found Kendal in her room with a needle in her arm and she is gone.' I didn't believe it, It was my fault, I got her to do coke, I turned my back on her, I let her die. All the stuff I thought about not worrying went out the window. I pulled over and I cryed, I cryed for my mom and Dad, for the lives I helped ruin, for the only girl I ever loved and for me. I remeber when I first saw her and how I thought she was beautiful and how when she died she wasen't beautiful, how she went out like a junkie.I picked up my brother and took him home. I went home and sold drugs through the summer, Just weed and E though. After Kendal's death alot of people stopped using white drugs and the whole town seemed to have a more friendly sense. About a week before I was to move my best friend, the one that never tweaked and always had my back drove drunk and at about 4am he fell asleep at the wheel or passed out and drove into a telephone pole, he was killed instantly. He told me once joking around that at his funeral to put a bong in his coffin, I coulden't sneek one in so I loaded a pipe and put it in. In 2 and a half years I lost 2 friends to bad desisions, I made plenty myself but made it out physically okay. This is not a story that is anti drug, I still smoke pot, drink and take pills. I just wanted to let people know the risks of drugs and how even if you say you might just be hurting yourself your not because the people who care about you the most sometimes end up getting hurt the most. I just wanted to share with you one of the experiences I had while on coke.  This drug gets a bad rap for being 'hardcore' or making people violent or shakey, but in my five years of recreational use I have had few unpleasant experiences, none of them significantly more upsetting than getting pass out drunk.  I personally think it's the best libido enhancer that there is, and no one I've dated has had a problem 'performing' on coke.My ex-boyfriend and I are both in the nightclub industry, he owns a bar, and I work at one.  Many people in this industry love to party and drink til the afternoon hours, and we are no exception.  On one particular occassion, my I'd hung out with my boyfriend while he was watching the bar he owns, a large and upbeat nightclub.  By one am, we had scored some coke and went into the office to do a few medium size lines.  I did two, he, being 6'4' and having about a hundred pounds on me, did three.  I can do more coke on average than most girls my size, I think I got used to doing it with my ex, who we're going to call C. for privacy's sake.For me, coke is instant euphoria.  As soon as I did the lines, I felt a warm rush of the coke going in through my nose and down the back of my throat, the taste of it all.  Moments later I feel a wave of heat an energy pass through me, starting at my neck and shoulders and moving down through my entire body.  The wave gives way to a pulsating energy, and I have the urge to move around.  More relevant to the discussion at hand, I begin to feel an extremely strong sexual desire, almost to the point of being violent, and I want to grab my boyfriend and kiss him, feel his hands all over my body.  I can't touch him hard enough.  We do this, and then we snort one more line before he goes off to work.  I grab my Crown and Coke (we both drink these) and go back out to the club where I mingle with my friends.  It's about two a.m.I am noticely more bubbly and energetic when I go back out on the floor.  I laugh with my friends and am very chatty.  I tell my friends S. (female) and D. (male) what we've got so we sneak out the back door to the club and snort more lines off the dashboard of the car.  Well, they do three lines each, and I do just a bump (for those who don't know, a line is about half as thick and half as long as a cigarette.  a bump is probably one third the size of a line) We've got Kid Rock on the radio and my body is buzzing. The music is great and I have an acute awareness of being alive.  I notice that as I always do when I get coked up, I have an overwhelming urge to keep throwing my head back.We sit in the car, drink our drinks and chat some more about random things.  The topics are random and most likely nonsensical but to us at the time, they strike us as being incredibly important and profound.  It's now about two fourty five in the morning, and the bar is closed to the public.  The last stragglers are making their way out, and the three of us use my keys to get in the back door and get ready for after-bar, which we have a lot.  The club has black out curtains so we close them so the cops can't see we have a party going on, and we turn on the lights on the dance floor and the music in the dj booth.It's three thirty in the morning now and I am ready to speed up, not slow down.  D. has scored his own coke and is now sharing with S, so C. and I have a little bit more than two eight balls between us.  We go back to the office and proceed to make love there after snorting one more line for me, three more for him.  I'm not trying to write a provocative or pornographic story here, but I am trying to accurately depict the way coke makes me feel, so here we go.C. throws me up on against on the wall and proceeds to rip my clothes off.  The drug makes me feel things more intensely and then it makes you crave even more intensity than that.  It is never enough.  I want to do everything, I want everything to be new and amazing and intense.  I want to do things that I would never normally want to do; I want people to watch us, I want anything dirty and raw that could happen to happen.  I feel that I can not get touched firmly enough or hard enough.  C. raises himself off me and snorts another line off a nearby desk.  I laugh and he picks up some more blow and I snort if off his hand.  We finish up what we're doing and go back out to join the others.  It's a little after four in the morning.We walk down the ramp that leads from the office to the club and I see a group of my friends sitting around telling stories, animated and wild, laughing and talking loudly.  They've been using too.  S. is sitting up on the bar and D. is standing behind her, where the bartenders stand, pouring tequila rose into her mouth from in an exaggerated gesture.  Euphporia fills the room.  I can see it in everyone's eyes; it's an amazing look, a look of exaggerated awareness of every sense.  The drug makes us all like that, like some better version of ourselves.  It does not make us wild, or manic, but makes us bound with life.  We are so happy to be together, to share this time, it's almost like a hippy thing, only we, in our leather pants and halter tops, are definitely not hippies.  It makes us feel like we have some private world here behind our locked doors, a commune.We all want to talk and we keep cutting each other off, but we laugh about it.  I'd say that the girls in the room are averaging about 3 lines and hour, the boys four or five.  I personally am doing about 5, and C. and D. are doing about 8.  Remember, at this point C, D, S and I are all pretty heavy users.  It's about six am, and we are all still going strong.  My body feels tingly all over, like its zinging with energy.I'm drinking more than I'm doing blow now because I feel a little bit too high.  By this I mean that I'm starting to feel like my heart is racing and pounding in my ears, and I'm beginning to feel anxiety welling up in my chest.  I tell myself to chill out and slam a giant crown and coke and I feel much better.  C. is slowing down too and we're totally euphoric.  We're both reasonably affectionate and open people, but now we're crazily in love.  He is telling everyone how much he loves me and that I'm his best girl, and spinning me around so everyone can see my 'amazing' ass, which he is now obsessed with.This type of thing would normally be embarrassing but I am free of inhibitions and wanting to be wild, wanting to say and do things that will make me feel alive, I feel that everything is acceptable and okay, and so I laugh and begin to tell everyone how good C. is in bed (or in the office, ahem).  We sit down on a couch and I notice that I can't seem to stop rubbing C.s leg, it's both a fixation and a nervous twitch (he later has heat rash...oops!).  It's about eight in the morning, and I've done about 1/16th of an ounce in 7 hours.  C. has done about 12/16th of an ounce.  We all decide to go home, so C. and I throw on our sunglasses and make the drive home.  We're still giddy but calming down, the buzzing in my body turning into pulsing waves, but I'm still euphoric.  I give him head in the car on the way home and think it's funny that people can see.  We get home at about 8:45 am and make a couple more Crown and Cokes and drink them so that we can get sleepy enough to go to bed.  We both still have the energy and libido to do it again so we do, and then we are able to fall asleep.When I wake it's about six thirty in the afternoon.  I feel a little bit shakey, like you would if you didn't eat enough.  That kind of shakey.  I laugh and think about how much fun I had.  C. has allready been up for a while and feels great.  It's a beautiful life. I've been taking paxil for about 2 years now for anxiety disorders (panic attacks & OCD).  I noticed a lot of submissions in the paxil experience vault here & thought I'd offer up my own experiences of paxil, well, fucking with me, as a little warning to anyone taking it either medicinally or recreationally.My worst paxil experience occurred a little over a year ago, when I had just upped my dose from 12.5mg to 25mg (per day).  I had been drinking all night with my friends, as much as I normally would, & late into the evening I sparked up a bowl of mj, which I also often do.  We smoked a bowl between the three of us that were there at the time, & I was feeling good & high-drunk for maybe a half hour after smoking.  At the time I was also continuing to drink beer.  But then I started feeling not-so-well.  I tried to tough it out, but eventually decided I needed to lie down for a while.  One of my friends, whose apartment we were in, asked if I was going to be sick & I said I was fine, fully believing it.  So I lay down on the couch & closed my eyes & sort of continued to participate in conversation, but I started to experience the closest thing I'd ever had to a trip at this point in my life.Eyes closed, I saw my body outlined in stars against the sky, sort of like a sparkly chalk outline.  It made me really happy & I think I was telling my friends about it.  Then I felt like I was in an attic - I knew where I *actually* was at the time, but in my mind I could see me & my friends in an attic & it fit for some reason.  I remembered one of my friends but forgot who the other girl was, & I was racking my brain trying to remember who she was - both her name & her appearance.  Then I started feeling nauseous & said I thought I was going to puke soon, but before anyone could do anything about it, I barfed.  All over myself & the couch I was on.  It was embarrassing & gross.My (wonderful!!) friend washed my shirt for me & got me a trash can, & I continued to barf into that & then spent the rest of the night clutching it & feeling crappy until I passed out.  I don't know for sure, but I attribute this to the paxil, since I have never been that helplessly sick from just alcohol & weed.  The 'trip' was also something that had never happened to me.  I should note also that I do take ritalin as well (40mg these days) & have done so for 13 years, so that's in the mix too, but I have found that it doesn't interact badly with weed or booze, as far as I can tell.  I never had another incident like this.My other notable paxil problem occurred a couple months ago.  Like I said, I've been taking meds for most of my life, & I don't know if I've ever screwed it up - except for this time of course.  I was at work & it was time for the afternoon ritalin; I was also on antibiotics then & it was time for that pill too.  I took two pills, & only after the fact did I realize I'd taken a paxil instead of a ritalin.  And of course I'd already taken my paxil that morning.  So I took the ritalin & hoped nothing bad would happen.  I noticed a couple hours later that I was more talkative than normal, hyper almost, & I talk a lot normally so I might have been annoying.  I felt kind of bouncy & 'up'.  It wasn't unpleasant really, but not particularly pleasant either.I went over to my friend's after work & smoked a couple bowls, but avoided alcohol of any kind due to aforementioned puking incident.  The high didn't feel very different, & it chilled out my hyperness a little.  Later I went home, smoked another bowl & watched some TV as I fell asleep.  At this point my jaw started feeling weird & I was clenching it a LOT.  I had to concentrate REALLY hard on not biting down & even then I eventually gave up on it.  My mouth would just not be like it normally is at resting state.  It was bizarre, but gone in the morning.So in conclusion, kids, respect the paxil & be careful with it.  Do as I say & not as I do, & try not to mix it with alcohol.  My doc told me that paxil & alcohol are metabolized by the same liver enzyme, so if you're liver's dealing with the paxil & then you throw a bunch of alcohol in it, things can get messy & even dangerous.  I've cut down on my liquor intake since finding that out, & I should probably cut down even more.  Haven't noticed any other problematic drug interactions with it, but as I am with the ritalin, I assume it makes my tolerance lower for certain things. (I don't know if this is actually true but it sounds good, no?)  If you're taking it recreationally... personally I don't quite get how paxil would be fun, but who am I to judge, so be careful & again, WATCH THE ALCOHOL!!  Also avoid MAOI's if you're going to be on paxil because MAOIs don't mix well with most Rx drugs.  I started smoking passionflower a while ago & it made me feel slightly weird, & then I found out it was an MAOI so no more of that. This is a report of my experience with AMT and its ability to potentiate the effects of alcohol(and the resulting sickness), and how I use this data to form a crude timeline of the possible MAOI effects of AMT.  It would be a ridiculous notion to use one topical case study to make broad generalizations on anything, but I strongly suggest that people experimenting with the drug do pay attention to this warning.Last weekend I took AMT twice.  I took 25mgs on Friday night, and 30mgs on Sunday.  Both times I very much enjoyed my trips. The effects were a little different in each experience, but aside from the set and setting being different, I would also imagine that there would be a form of tolerance (at least to some of the effects).On the following Tuesday night, just two days later, I had a Band practice at my friends place across campus and I decided to drink a bit.  I am usually very resistant to the effects of alcohol.  Even my closest friends usually can't tell when I'm quite drunk, and getting to that point usually takes quite a bit of drinkin'.  For a gauge, I am usually a little buzzed after a flask of Jose Quervo and a twelve pack of beer rarely has more than a medium effect on my judgement, rational, motor skills, reaction time, or overall cognition.  Also, in the majority of cases, I wake up early feelng fine.But on this particular Tuesday night, I drank 8 beers and a shot of whiskey over the course of 5 hours, not so much by my standards, but I ended up quite sorry.  I was very, very ill.  I vomited alot (which I rarely do), and ended up trying to dismiss the spins as I attempted to pass out.  There was one factor of this that definately didn't sit right, I was capable of some deep and coherent intelligent thought, but it was so unpleasant to be awake that I'd sooner be hit in the head with a tire-iron. In this state, I was still able to do internet searches on MAOIs and on AMT.  Despite my level of ethenol intoxication, I was a bit scared. I awoke the next morning very early and very ill.  I vomited some more and over the course of the next day, I slowly emerged from my hangover and the accompanying viscious headache.It is very unusual for alcohol to affect me in this way, particularly at this dose.  The only causal variable that I can think of is the AMT.  I'm not sure exactly how long two closely placed dosages would have effect, but I do recall a passage of TIHKAL in which four days of anti-depressant effects were noted after a single administration.  Whether the Tyramine in the beer was reacting with lingering inhibition of monoamine breakdown in my brain is not completely certain.However, the next day (Thursday, the day I am writing this) I woke up feeling fine and proceeded to drink a protien shake and large cup of coffee along with my multi-vitamin, 5-HTP, and fish body oil (sounds rather gross I know, but Omega 3s are important).  This is my normal morning routine, but it was the first time this week that I had ingested it in observance of the AMT.  About an hour later, in my Biopsych class, I got excessively jittery and experienced a little generalized anxiety with very minor hand tremors.  This is rare for me and it's nothing that I couldn't deal with, But I feel that it might still stem from a contraindication.  This lasted about 4 hours.Now I can't say for sure whether either of these reactions were caused by the MAOi effects of the AMT, but I don't want to find out for sure via the hard way.  If they were indeed caused by this, I was lucky.  From what I've read, strokes, blood clots, and death are very realistic outcomes of conflicting reactions of this sort.  I am writing this so that maybe others might be careful on the days following a trip, when it might not be the first thing on one's mind.  I will still use AMT, it is a wonderful substance, but I am going to instill a week long pot/clonopin-only rule following my experiences. I was annoyed with my wife because she was going to be working late (she was ‘on call’ at a hospital), and the dinner I was preparing would again be left to get cold.  Between 5 and 7 that night, I finished a couple of Coors Lights, then decided I’d just go to bed.  Just knock myself out and go to bed.  I took the last two Ambien CR from my first prescription of CR (although I had been taking Ambien for two years), emptying the bottle, but being aware that my new monthly prescription of 30 was in another bottle on my nightstand.  I lay on the bed and began to write in my journal, thinking I’d get to sleep soon.  The next thing I was conscious of was holding the open new bottle of Ambien CR.  Blankness.  Then I was lying on the bed, on my face, with my left cheek full of capsules that I just knew had to be the entire contents of the Ambien CR bottle.  I thought to myself “You don’t want to do this”, but one of the capsules slid down my throat.  Blankness.  I saw the empty Ambien CR bottle in front of me and thought, “Oh, shit!  I need a signal to someone.”  So I jammed the empty bottle down on my left index, second finger and thumb until I couldn’t shake it off.  Blankness.  I jumped up off the bed and hurried downstairs holding my journal, which I dropped near the couch where my wife was sitting.  I had a terrific urge to go for a motorcycle ride.  Then it occurred to me, “I’ll kill myself on the motorcycle before I even get five miles down the highway.”  Then it occurred to me that I didn’t care.  I backed the motorcycle out of the garage badly, ran it into a parked trailer and dumped it over.  I somehow righted it and tried to start it a few times.  (I was later told I tried for 30 minutes to start it.)  I remember giving up on starting it, and I remember my wife’s face below my left knee pulling the bike’s kickstand down so that I could get off the bike.  Blankness.Someone asked me what I liked to be called, and I told them an old nickname. Blankness.  Someone pushed down on my left shoulder (I was on my face) and said “Get up”.  I ignored them because they hadn’t called me by the name I’d given them.  Sometime later, my personal doctor came in.  I don’t know why, but I thought my entire old life was dead – that it was all gone and that I had done away with it and would never get it back.  I asked him why he was there, wherever I was.  He said it was kind of a favor to my wife, and what was the matter?  I told him that it was all over – that my son hated me.  He looked surprised, and he said:  “But you’re always telling me all the things you’ve done together, how well he’s getting along, how much you love him.”  I said “He hates me.”  My doctor looked deeply at me, shook his head, and said “I don’t know what this is, but I think it might be some strange reaction between your Ambien and Concerta.  Don’t worry.  I’ll get you out of here tomorrow.”  And he left.I now noticed that I was in a room with a semi-conscious, urine-dribbling masturbater – but I fell asleep anyway.  Blankness.  My glasses were missing, and somebody was asking me to sign something.  I said I wouldn’t sign anything until I had my glasses.  Blankness.  Dinner was announced, and someone urged me to eat.  “I won’t eat until I have my glasses.  I don’t know what sort of place this is and I want to be able to see my food!”  It seemed forever, but my glasses were found in a locked locker in my room.  I remember being treated as stupid because I should have known they were there.  But I had no memory of the contents of the closet, or of anything beyond getting off the motorcycle the night before.Another meal came, but my glasses were found.  I took it over to a corner of the main room and began to slowly eat.  My wife and son came in.  I asked her why she was there, and why she had brought my son.  She didn’t seem to understand the question.  She said “You didn’t really try to kill yourself or you wouldn’t have called for help.”  I assured her that I must have tried to kill myself because I had obviously swallowed an entire bottle of sleeping pills.  The facts, I thought, speak for themselves.  I had no patience for her or my son, nor did I know why they had come in to torment me.I  saw my name up on a board, and by it were the words “Take all Precautions”.  The ward was locked.  I avoided the near-gomer in the next bed and went to sleep, only to wake up about 1:00 p.m. to the sound of a labeling machine with an alarm on it, and a nurse practically screaming into a phone on a personal call.  I tried for thirty minutes or so to get back to sleep, but when the near-gomer began to beat his meat in the next bed, it was all too much, and I went to the nurses station and asked for the Patient’s Rights booklet.  I studied it and found out I was entitled to have at any time the presence of an attorney or other.  I asked to make a call.  The night supervisor refused to hook up the phone, saying that it was ward policy, and ward policy always trumped patients’ rights.  I became insistent until a kind nurse intervened and said:  “The original problem was you getting back to sleep – why don’t you move into the single bed across from the station for the rest of the night and we’ll put the labelling machine on hold.  That way you can get some sleep.”  I was so delighted at the kind nurse’s diplomacy, that I accepted.At 5:45 a.m., the back of my hand was painfully punctured to draw some blood.  And I was out at the telephone at 7:00 a.m. as it was hooked up.  “Nurse Ratched” looked nervously at me, because she thought I was going to make a call to an office that was closed, in spite of the Patient’s Rights handbook stating that the Patient had the right to call the attorney or helper published on the back of the handbook at any time, 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.  It turns out that the published office is openly only during business hours, five days a week.A half hour of calisthenics, and a 45-minute session of a “wishful thinking” board game kept me in mind of 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' where Randall Patrick McMurphy became angry at Hardin for not telling him that Nurse Ratched was in charge and had the say over who got to leave the asylum and who had to stay.  “Play the game” I told myself, while wanting to puke.  They'll never let you leave, otherwise.  Just Play the game.  At the same time (this was now Saturday – I had come into the ER on Thursday night) I was certain that I could get out, at the earliest, on Monday morning.  But I was aware that after 72 hours, the hospital could keep me for another four days that could easily stretch into 30 or however many.  I just hoped that the hospital didn’t find out my insurance might pay.  I’d be in here forever, I thought, if they find out I’ve got good health care.By this time, I was quite aware that, although I had obviously swallowed a bunch of Ambien, I had had no wish to commit suicide.  Later on, I learned that I had drank at least another beer and a very large glass of wine, and some Amaretto that was around.  The police picked me up in a neighbor’s yard and took me to the Emergency Room.  They apparently forgot to tell the hospital who I was (they had spoken with my wife and never got back to her about taking me in), because the hospital proceeded to do every test known to man on me.  CT brain scan, screens for every toxic or abused substance known.  Also an activated charcoal gastric lavage (which is the only thing they didn’t exorbantly charge me for - $5,000 for a Behavioral Health unit room overnight, and over $15,000 total, including a series of $48 lab screenings which they charged up to $400 each for!)My wife came to see me, and I no longer had the warped wonder at why she would be there.  She was so pretty and loving, and I cried and smiled and held her hand and remembered that, at 57, we had been sweethearts since we were 16.  So apparently, a day and a half after my mistake of taking two Ambien on a glass and a half of beer, I had recovered.  (Not completely, the next day, my throat came down so sore that I could hardly talk.)  I had no memory of a tube down my throat, nor any Emergency Room activity, nor anybody talking to me, nor anything, really.  I was constantly surprised that the nurses and staff treated me as if I was continuously conscious and should remember everything that had happened.  When, as far as I knew, I had been completely out the whole time.  The Crisis Nurse who called my wife the first morning claimed that I had been “gaming” her, and that I wouldn’t tell her who I was, and she asked my wife if she ought to consider a divorce.    These little bits and pieces keep filtering in, but I haven’t remembered anything that I didn’t know about the next morning.A shrink came in late that afternoon and asked me what happened.  I explained the above.  He said, 'It's common.  You're just one of those people who can't take Ambien.'  'What?', I said, 'I almost died and thought I deserved it.'  'It's common', he reiterated.  'Let's get you out of here.'  My experience?  Ambien never again.  That stuff’ll kill, and worse – it’ made me think I deserved to die. I should start off by stating that I am very experienced with salvia, having used it over 50 times.  I’m so used to the effects now that I am able to sort of remain “grounded” after using it, meaning that I know that I’m laying there on my bed under the effects of salvia and I feel in complete control the entire time.  I usually use salvia alone without a sitter because I am confident that I can use it and remain perfectly motionless and not get up and move around.On to the report.  I was bored on a Thursday night so I decided to have a few beers.  After about 6 beers I was still bored out of my mind and decided I had no real reason to stay awake, so I took 1.5 mg of clonazepam, which I have a legitimate prescription for, to get to sleep.  After about 45 minutes the clonazepam kicks in and I’m pretty damn wasted and feeling good, so I decide to stay up a little longer.  At this point for some reason I decide to smoke some salvia.  I usually respect salvia and don’t use it just to get fucked up, but my sense of judgment was quite impaired at this point so I thought what the hell, why not.I put a small amount of 20x in a pipe and proceeded to smoke it.  After holding in the smoke for 30 seconds, I exhale, and instantly after the effects hit me.  This trip was unlike any I have had before.  In fact I wouldn’t really call it a trip, it was more like just the most total and complete confusion I have ever felt in my life.  I didn’t know what was up and what was down, I had no idea where or who or what I was.  It was like I was just this ball being thrown around between dimensions of pure craziness that completely defied explanation.During the overall confusion, I sort of remember having like a dozen of what I’d call “mini-trips”, where I would have some sort of insanely bizarre and intense vision or sensation and then come back down to what I thought was reality, only to realize that the reality I was in was not in any way related to actual reality.  I would then go spinning off into another mini-trip completely different that the last one.  This went on for what seemed like hours but was actually probably more like 10 minutes.   Without going into in-depth explanations of these mini-trips (which are pretty much unexplainable anyway), they basically involved a slew of vortexes, alien landscapes, entities, etc. that usually happen on high doses of salvia.   To have these things happen over and over again was just way too much.Towards the end of this trip I finally remembered that I was on salvia, and I remember literally begging the salvia to make it stop, all I wanted to do was go have another beer and go to sleep, but the salvia decided to kick my ass around some more.  It was like it was punishing me for trying to use it just to get fucked up.  I consider salvia to be a friend, an ally, but at this point it was treating me like I had just slept with its girlfriend or whatever and wanted to beat the shit out of me. I found myself coming down from the salvia on the floor in the living room of my apartment.  I started out on my bed in my room.  I sort of recall being all over the apartment at various stages in the trip, which is strange for me because I never have had problems staying still while on salvia.  After the experience I was very shook up psychologically and my mind felt like it had been put in a blender.  All I wanted to do was go to bed to try and forget about the whole thing.  Luckily the clonazepam did its job and I was asleep in no time.What I learned from this is experience is that salvia will still kick my ass if I am stupid with it, no matter how experienced I think I am.  Also, I shouldn't use salvia while heavily sedated.  I think this is what caused my massive confusion, much more so that just the salvia.  I usually have a couple of beers before using salvia and find that this enhances the effects and lessens anxiety, but this time I was just too fucked up beforehand.I’m not into the new-agey crap where people say that plant entheogens have spirits or whatever, but I almost feel that way with salvia.  The whole time I could feel it mocking me and laughing about how easily it can tear my entire world apart. I drink at least 5 days out of 7, usually 2-6 units, but I enjoy a binge about twice a week (between 7 and 20 units). I used to be very good at avoiding hangovers despite drinking lots. I always want to drink more than I usually allow myself, since I reckon I'm bordering on alcoholism. I suffer from anxiety and found alcohol an effective way of coping with it.Since taking venlafaxine I feel drunk after about 4 units, and often don't feel I can drink any more after about 6. I have bad hangovers no matter how little I drink. It also doesn't work on the anxiety like it used to. After about 6-8 units my experiences are no different with or without venlafaxine, except the evil hangover the next day. These trends have remained consistent under a range of mental states and times of day.I wanted to write this report because my experience is almost opposite to the other report of venlafaxine and alcohol I read on this site. Venlafaxine users rely on resources like this - The patient information sheet states 'avoid alcohol', but I couldn't find any studies of effects of venlafaxine and alcohol in humans, so I assumed it was precautionary advice simply because they did not know for sure. Rat studies show no adverse effects. It started out as a very ominous night. Everything was set. I was waiting for a friend to get off work, he got off early. We had everything packed. All of the drugs and alcohol were taken care of. After several phone calls, we had everything we needed to get completely twisted on drugs in the forest. Camping grounds that is. We went to this park about 5 minutes or so from where we lived, and it was quite secluded from the outside world, where people live their daily lives in ignorance of what's really out there for them. We had found what was really out there. 'It's all about connection.' Si Senor.We got there with a little trouble, J had almost wrecked my car getting there, through the front gate actually. Somehow a giant wooden pole just jumped out at him and he had to swirve to save our lives! So we met our friend O up at the camp site, the last camp site available in the entire park, and he had already dug into the grass, smoking almost an entire gram before we got there. He told us of his trials, chasing squirrels and playing guitar, while simotaniously having conversations with a nice and cozy tree that overlooked out firepit. As soon as we got there the silly hats came on. I was the only one who wore my normal full brimmed fishing hat. P had his mad hatter hat, J had some odd mixture of a British/Santa Clause had that had these stars that lit up in a nice hue of red. O had his sombrero. Si Senor. We started chatting up at the trunk of O's car and already the neighbors had spotted us, one half drunk negro came over and started chatting. He wanted our drugs, and we are good people so of course we gave him some. It turns out his children had thrown his stash out for reasons that were beyond me. Glad to help.He stumbled back to his campsite and we broke out the beers. 2 cases of MGD, bottled, for the 4 of us. The night had officially began. We get everything set up and I had learned that J2 was going to come up and keep us comapny for a while. J2 was cool, I'd only met her a few times and I had been high on several of those occasions. She had come down and J packed a bowl. Everyone except myself smoked from this wonderful peace pipe. I was getting drug tested so there was no chance I was going to get fucked, besides, there will be plenty of times to smoke in the future. As they all got ripped I started to get desperate for something to take control of me. The beer wasn't cutting it.Around 8:00 or so we broke out the shrooms and divided them between ourselves, minus J2, who was leaving in a few hours to go to a party. I had a full eigth, while everyone else took a half eighths. I'd only done shrooms once before and I wanted to hallucinate or at least trip until my balls fell completely off and started to change colors and talk to me in tongues. I didn't know it but this was going to be the most intense and terrible drug experience I had ever had, that's not to say it wasn't beautiful and liberating at the same time. The shrooms did kick it quite quick, much quicker than my first time, and I welcomed it with an open mind. Before long we started to go completely out of our minds, I had no possible clue of what was going on, the clouds made faces and the trees started to pulse. I heard Led Zeppelin. We had a few beers and I thought we should go introduce ourselves to the Zeppelin folk, who turned out to be very nice people, a little old, but still nice by any means. After a small chat we came back to our fire and I didn't know where O went, in fact O made several trips that night alone and nobody knew where he was or where he went, but that's ok because we trusted him. We came back and somewhere O pulled out his Ipod and wanted to share his creation. He had made a song on his computer full of incredible and genious music. We came to the conclusion O was a mad scientist and had created a song that no one could handle, it was so intense, even without drugs. It was like he was the scientist who had stumbled upon LSD. Hoffman I think his name was. Oh well, that's besides the point. This music was genious and totally mind blowing with a head full of psilocybin. Many patterns and odd visions came about when I closed my eyes. As the night went on we got more and more drunk and more and more insane out of our minds. I got very emotional, I had taken way too much, more than I could handle, but I had to. There was something throughout the midsts of all this that kept me sane and knowing that I would be ok. Whatever it was was like a needle in the haystack of the universe, in the sense that it was very far away and barely comforting but it was there. I missed my girlfriend, I felt like she completed me on an entirely new level. In our shroomy madness, we all came to the conclusion that this was it. This was what it was about. Man sitting in front of a fire having good times, finding out the secrets to the universe, finally realizing that everything was connected, and in that sense, everything was everything. I am this fire. I am J. I am O. I am P. I am everything and everything is me. There is no individuality inside me or anyone. I was completely convinced that I was everything and everything was me. I couldn't tell the difference anymore. It was all about connection. That's all life is about, my connection to my friends, my family, my partner, my god. Whatever it is, that connection gives me a sense of hope and a feeling that everything will be ok, that I am not completely alone even when I feel completely alone. It's the subconscious explanation for being here.I realized that existance is just the transfer of energy. My connection to everyone, every action I performed no matter how grandeur or minute was just transferring energy to someone or something. It got a reaction out of them, and their reaction affected something/one else and that energy transferred around the world. We die, our bodies give energy to the earth, that earth grows plants, those plants keep people alive, etc. It's all about connection. At this point circles started to make sense. There has never been a beginning, there will never be an end, I felt like I was the only thing that was real.This drug began to take a turn for the worse. I felt like god, not some entity that controls life and the sort, but I was part of the energy. Everything is everything, there is no individuality, I got a vision of energy, on some supreme and spiritual level. I had decoded the entire universe, there is no fire in front of me, these friends arn't here. I started to see in terms of energy, nothing was real, its all just energy that I'm interpreting to my benifit, my friends arn't real, my family isnt real, I'm not real. My girlfriend isn't real. I swear to god my heart fucking broke. I fucking lost it. I felt so alone, yet I wasn't alone because I wasn't anything, I was everything, as was everything else.I had a terrible identity crisis, I didn't know the difference between being myself, and being everything/one. The identity was there, hidden. I couldn't find it but it was there, or else why would I have felt so bad about the thought of my girlfriend being nothing? In fact, my girlfriend was me, and I was her. We were both energy. I couldn't take this any longer. If there is a god, I felt like I had met him, or rather I was him, because I had answered all of the answers to the universe that man  had wondered since time began. I broke down. I cried. I cried because I had no purpose anymore, I didn't matter. I felt disconnected. I was just energy, my friends wern't there, I wasn't there, my family wasn't there, and my girlfriend wasn't there. We were all the fucking same. I stared into the fire blindly and began to cry so hard because I had just lost everything I had ever loved. I loved my friends so much, I loved my girlfriend even more, she makes me whole and complete and I didn't feel like living any longer. I had lost my connection to everyone, because my connection to everyone was false, we were all the same. How can you have a connection to other people and things if they are you and you are them? You can't. I could not comprehend any of this. it couldn't be true. I hated this and I wanted it to end. I didn't want to live. I could have killed myself and I wouldn't have cared. But of course I didn't because I didn't because somewhere I knew I would be straight in a couple of hours. Before I knew it O was reaching over to wipe my nose because I must've been crying a lot harder than I remember because my entire face was wet and I couldn't breathe at all through my nostrils, which were stopped up all the way back. I realized, I did have friends. They did care about me, and none of this terrible vision was true. I mean it was still relavent, but this helped me to come back. And I did. I came back slowly, but eventually I became sane again and connected with everything like I always had been. As terrible and frightening as this part of the trip was, it was equally beautiful and necessary. It needed to happen. It liberated me and I felt cleansed. This was the wake up call I had been looking for a long time. Around 3 or 4 I was back to ground zero. Not entirely back but around 80 percent or so alright. I don't think I will be ok for a couple days, but I know I will be fine eventually. I don't think this experience was a 'Difficult Time' or a 'Glowing Experience' but instead a mixture of both, so you decide what you want to take it as. I was surrounded by loved ones through this entire thing and that's probably the only thing that got me through it. I wasn't going to kill myself at any point, although I wanted to just to end the pain. Background info: I am 24 years old and have used numerous drugs in the past. I won't bother to list them all, but my favorites are high-grade marijuana, which I use frequently, and the occassional mushroom trip. I recently graduated from college with the highest honors, earning a bachelor's degree in mathematics. Contrary to most of the reports I've read, my experiences with coke have been mostly positive. Following are descriptions of the two times I have used this powder.First time: It was March 2005, during my spring break. I was in a very positive mood and was well rested. I went to my good friend Will's house for a night of kicking back and drinking; I had not seen him for a few months, so I was looking forward to talking with him and catching up on things. After having a couple beers and chatting with him a bit, Will pulls out a 1/2 gram bag of coke($20 worth around here) and begins to chop up some of it. I knew that Will did coke sometimes, and I was curious about the substance, so I told him that I would like to try some if it's okay. I asked him a few questions about it; the most important thing he told me was that if I only do coke very infrequently, on special occasions, then there will be no problems.We each had 1/4 of a gram that night, beginning at 11PM and taking small lines and bumps throughout the night while continuing to drink. Snorting the coke was more comfortable than I had imagined, and I felt no pain while doing so. We spent the whole night listening to music and talking. Among other things, we talked about past events, our plans for the future, and our friends and family. We had very open conversations in which we shared with each other past mistakes and lessons learned from them, and what each of us percieved as his personal shortcomings.The effects that the coke had on me include increased energy, increased heart rate, increased focus(usually alcohol slows me down mentally; coke counteracted this and then some), loss of social inhibitions, and a lack of fatigue/need for sleep. We finished the coke at around 3:30AM, and I went home at 5AM, having consumed a 12-pack. I felt a body buzz from the alcohol, but my mind felt none of the effects. I could not sleep at home, so I ended up staying awake and going to bed early the next night. No adverse effects followed my indulgence in the snow, and I didn't really think about coke for about two months afterwards.Second time: Shortly after my graduation, Will invited me to a get-together that he was planning. He was inviting some longtime friends of ours and was planning to pick up some coke for the gathering. After pondering this for a minute, I told Will that I would be there. The day of the party, I was in excellent spirits; I was excited about seeing my friends, one of whom, Rocky, lives across the country and who I had not seen for over two years. Five of us came to the event. After arriving there, I learned that Will had obtained an 8-ball for $100. Other party favors consisted of a fifth of tequila, two cases of beer, and a small amount of dank that I had. At 7PM, we began the night by each taking a couple shots of tequila. We chilled for a minute after that, playing poker and talking as Will prepared the first line for each of us. When it was my turn to blow at about 8PM, I sniffed up what I think is an average-sized line in two inhalations. Again, I felt no discomfort from the powder except for the bitter drip in the back of my throat that followed. Beer was very useful for killing that taste in my throat.The effects the coke had on me include a boost in energy, a warm feeling throughout my body, increased focus, loss of social inhibitions, and increased heart rate. Mentally, I felt a peace of mind, similar to the feeling I have had when on ecstasy but without the speedy feeling, which I dislike. I felt like my mind had been purged of the various things that demand my attention throughout the day; I could focus completely on anything I wished.I experienced these effects after every line I would take that night. Oddly, neither time while using coke did I feel any euphoria, the main effect sought by coke users.Even though we were hanging out for 10+ hours, the time seemed to fly by. In summary of the night's key events, 1. we played Texas hold-em as a drinking game (loser(s) have to drink), 2. I had a nice conversation with Rocky, catching up on the things going on in our lives, 3. we smoked a couple bowls and drank like fish, 4. a LOT of talking took place, 5. we went outside at about 3:30AM to get some fresh air, and 6. we each had 5 average-sized lines spread out throughout the night, the last ingested around 4:00AM.I estimate that we each had about .6-.7 grams of coke that night. I don't think the last line had much of an effect on me; around 4:30AM my memory gets very sketchy. I think maybe my mental fatigue began to overwhelm the effects of the coke. I remember feeling the most drunk I have ever been without getting sick. However, I still didn't feel like sleeping until I fell asleep around 6:30AM. I awoke at 10:00AM and, feeling no ill effects from the night before, went home for some much needed breakfast. That was a very laid back day during which I slept about 12-14 hours. I had a great time at the party even though my memory is a bit fuzzy at certain points.Summary: I guess coke does not work as well for me as it does for others; I can think of no explanation for the lack of euphoria. Still, it was fun, but it is definitely not one of my favorites. I know the coke was good quality because the more experienced users told me they were feeling it. I will never buy my own bag of coke since it is ridiculously expensive and it doesn't seem to work well for me. I might try some in the future if it is offered to me, but I don't plan on trying coke again for quite some time. I had previously performed Harry's 'Cold Water World' APAP extraction on 10 pills of generic Vicodin (5 mg Hydrocodone, 500 mg APAP).  I did three filtration passes, all with the same filter: a closely woven cotton cloth (a pair of Old Navy boxer shorts, to be exact).  I do not have a proper way to measure small volumes, so I was using a 300g*.1g digital scale.  Since the final liquid weighed only 48.6 grams, I decided to dilute it with enough water such that the final weight was 100 grams, to make dosing easier and decrease my percent error per dose to 0.001% (=0.1 gram scale resolution / 10 gram dose).  The mixed drink that I was drinking was one part 80-proof vodka, four parts soda, carefully measured.  (Yes, I'm that anal.)  Thus, the final drink had a strength of 8% alcohol.My mindset at the time was one of excitement about the prospect of being intoxicated for a fun day.  I attend a university at which there is a yearly celebration of our university's founder, and it was on this day that I had my experience.  Traditionally on this day, everyone on campus drinks or is intoxicated in some way, and the general atmosphere is one of yelling and partying all over the place, especially outdoors.  It's a very fun time to which we all look forward throughout the year.Unfortunately, it was quite gloomy and a bit rainy on this particular day, and it seemed to have dampened not only the ground, but everyone's spirits as well.  A group of friends and I, approximately 10 of us, had planned on spending the day grilling out at our campus commons, discreetly drinking throughout.  The rain came on just after we had arrived, so we decided to move our grill and table of food to under the alcove of a nearby building until the rain let up enough to go back out to the grass.  At approximately 2:45 I started drinking, and had probably drank about 8 ounces of the mixed drink by 3:00, at which point I ingested 20 grams of my hydrocodone solution (10 mg hydrocodone).15-20 minutes later, I started to feel the effects of the substances.  At first I just felt a little spaced out; the ground seemed to pull slightly away from me when I focused on it, and when I turned my head in a given direction, my surroundings would continue in that direction, for just a split second, after I had stopped turning.  This was different from a drunken dizziness in that it was not a hindrance; it did not present a challenge in moving about, so much as it added a new aspect to the movement.  The effects were very slight though.A short while later, perhaps 20 minutes, I found myself at the edge of the alcove, in a large puddle of water barefoot.  At first I was trudging back and forth through it, enjoying the feeling of the water flowing between my toes and over my feet.  A short while later I found myself dancing in it, even though there was no music, in a style similar to tap dancing, even though I have no idea how to tap dance.  Dancing in puddles, splashing about, became a theme throughout the day.No one else was outside celebrating this day but us, and we all had skipped all of our classes for the day, so we were just hanging out, with a few of us drunkenly and good-naturedly yelling at people on their way to and from their classes, telling them to celebrate.  So basically we were a bunch of drunk bastards eating, grilling and drunkenly yelling at everyone who was going about their normal business.The substances had a very mild effect on me from a self-conscious standpoint.  I often didn't realize that I was being affected at all, until I would look back at my actions, often only minutes or seconds afterward, and realize that they were not of my usual self: my inhibitions had been lowered greatly without my even noticing it.At about 3:45 or so, I noticed a group of tan-uniformed men coming up from the other end of the commons with bags and sticks in their hands.  I immediately thought 'Those guys are snake hunters! I didn't know we had a snake problem around here.'  I quickly realized that they were actually picking up trash or weeds or something, but the idea of them hunting snakes seemed more appealing, so I went with it and started telling everyone about our snake problem, and yelling at passersby to watch out for snakes.At one point, perhaps 4:30 or so, I found myself eating a bag of chips while waving my body left to right, and moving my arms up and down.  While I was doing it, I didn't realize that it was at all unusual, but I soon noticed a friend fixedly watching me and giggling.  This made me question my behavior, and embarrassed me a bit.  But I quickly decided, 'Fuck it, I'm having fun and I'm not hurting anybody,' and embraced it.  Soon I was dancing all around, yelling, 'This is how I eat chips!' to all of the people walking by.  This was at just the time where one class had just let out, and another was about to start, so there were a lot of people out.  I climbed up onto a chair and kept doing my dance and shouting 'This is how I eat chips!'At about 5:00 or 6:00, I noticed two geese perched on the corner of the roof of one of the nearby academic buildings, looking out onto campus.  For some reason I started to feel that they were taunting us, looking down condescendingly upon us, so I started yelling at them.  'You think you're better than us?!' and the like.  A friend (who was coincidently on DXM) came up and started yelling with me, and dancing around making bird noises, taunting the geese right back.  I soon joined in with the bird noises.  Soon we were having a call-and-response session with the geese, and it almost felt like we were actually shit-talking with them, back and forth.  I noticed sometime in the middle of it all that we had drawn quite a bit of attention to ourselves and there were people gathered at the windows of the building watching my friend's bird dance, but I never felt paranoid or embarrassed by it all; it was all in good fun, and I think everyone else knew it too.Eventually the geese decided to leave, and flew right over their heads.  In retrospect, I think they just flew straight off of the roof, maintaining a constant elevation, but at the time I thought otherwise.  It seemed as though they were coming straight down at us, and we ducked down and covered our heads.  Soon they were gone though, and our friends congratulated us for winning the shit-talking competition.Similar antics went on throughout the day, and I drank about three 16-ounce cups of the mixed drink spaced evenly throughout.  Eventually, at about 7:00 or 7:30, the sun started disappearing and we began to get cold, so we moved all of our stuff back to the dorms, where we continued to party.  By this time the effects of the hydrocodone had worn off, and I just drank until we went to sleep.  The further amounts of alcohol affected me as though I had been drinking all day:  I got a slight headache and was quite dehydrated, but nothing too severe.My general feeling about the whole experience was that it was akin to drinking without the negative effects.  I never had any loss of coordination, nausea, confusion, etc, but my inhibitions were as lowered as in a beyond-tipsy state:  I felt free to yell, be obnoxious and genially belligerent, and never felt embarrassed by it.  It was all around a pleasant experience. Wow! Talk about extremely relaxed. Right now I don't have a care in the world.  My back and neck muscles have been bothering me all day, from a car accident 5 years ago. I decided to take 2 Soma and chase it with a few shots of Crown Royal.Right now the room is spinning, in a good way. Very relaxed. I could go to sleep right now, and feel like I could sleep for days. Every muscle in my entire body is so relaxed you could hit me with a sledge hammer, and I would grin at you and ask for another.The phone just rang. It's the Catholic prayer line asking me to pray for a lady from our parish who is very sick with cancer. I told them with slurred speech that I would not only pray for her but for everyone who ever had cancer, both present and past. I also told the person that I would even pray for everyone in the world who may be diagnosed with cancer in the future. Further, I told her that I would pray for people on other planets that might come down with cancer. I told her that cancer would top my prayer list for the next several years. Wonder why she ended the conversation so abruptly? Does she suspect that I feel stoned? ;)Empirically speaking, my mind feels fuzzy. Like when one first wakes up from anethesia or just before sleep overtakes someone. I have to constantly correct my spelling as I type this since my fingers are so relaxed and are randomly hitting the keys. Hearing is very acute. I can hear a pin drop about now. Thoughts are random, scattered, and tangential at best.Nothing euphoric like the effects of THC. Body feels heavy. Like I weigh 800 pounds. Rocking and bobbing my head are pleasurable. I feel like one of those Weeble Wobbles from the 70s ('Weebles wobble but they won't fall down'). Getting ready to watch some television. Overall, the sedative qualities of Soma are magnified with alcohol.No introspection noted. Hell, I don't even feel like thinking about anything right now, except perhaps the couch and an old movie to lull me to sleep. Only side effects noted are unbalance and slurring. This was one of the weirdest but amazing experiences in my life. The background was that we were going to a beach party which had about 400 people at it. I bought myself a 6 pack of Woodstocks (Bourbon & Coke), my mate brought 4 joints and we went down the beach.The night hadn't started very well as the cops were already there before the party was started; splitting people up as they didn't want anything happening there that night. After drinking 4 of my woodstocks I was feeling very drunk, I am not that tolerable to alcohol, and we went to sit on some benches and smoke some joints. The 4 of us went through 3 joints and I must say I did take a fair chunk out of them. The marijuana that my friend obtained is extremely strong and one of my very experienced friends mentioned before that it may be laced with another drug. After smoking 2 of them we were all very giggly and I was feeling fantastic, it was until the end of the 3rd one where I attempted to keep the smoke in my lungs for a very long time did the trip begin to turn nasty.I walked over near some play equipment and a friend of mine called me, I didn't understand what was happening but the whole world was moving backwards and forward, when I reached my friend, the whole world seemed to be stuck in some sort of small loop where he would keep asking how I'm going. I realised that something was not right. I walked over to my really good friend and I told him that something was completely wrong with me. I couldn't feel my body at all, I could tell that my body was walking and I could feel my feet touch the ground but I couldn't feel my own weight, I also couldn't feel my hands or face. When people started to tell that something was wrong with me they immediately asked me what was wrong and were crowding around me, the problem was that when people talked, it seemed to really hurt me, I asked them to all leave me for a while, but look over me as we were in a strange place with many drunk people looking to start a fight and I really didn't want to be hurt.After repeatedy telling myself that I was fine and that I was on drugs and it would all be over in the morning I became a little bit more relaxed, my pulse was still very high and my breathing was heavy. Then we had to start moving as my friends still wanted to party and the night was young. We walked up a hill and stayed there for a while and wait for some other people, I had been trying to combat the effects of the drugs up until here by pacing, it seemed that when I would stay still the sounds and visuals would get worse. I decided to just let go and try and relax and let the drugs do what they want, until I was pointed out from my friend that I was rotating my body around very largely, so I snapped out of it and we moved on to a person's house.While we were walking to this person's house, things were starting to seem like a video game. The game XIII is made up of different 'layers', this is how I felt. The people close to me were closer 'layers' and the things far away were like a static background that did not move. I took a sip of bourbon as it was the only liquid I could come a hold of until we found the person's house; I had terrible cotton mouth. When we arrived to the person's house and I had water I felt much better. I sat down on a chair and this is where I had started to calm down a bit and started to enjoy the trip. After a while of getting used to my new optic cameras I could start to enjoy them. Everything started to look so cool, I remember looking around and everything looked like it was a play of some sort with the background and a bin, trampoline, couple in a chair and another group of people all actors and props in this play. The best thing was people coming up to me, my perspective on the world was completely funky, everything looked like they were in one of those funhouse mirrors, when people got close to me, they got really, really close, sounds were also really strange, when people were talking either side of my head, they seemed to be soft and slow, go really fast and loud, then slow and soft again. Another strange thing is that when I would close my eyes I would sort of have daredevil vision, I could see the sounds people were hearing through my eyelids.This was getting comfortable until my mates wanted to move again, this become very annoying as all I really wanted to do was sit down and chill out. When I moved it made the hallucination more intense and made me more uncomfortable. The trip lasted for about 2 hours in real time but to me it felt like hours had passed, I kept checking my phone and in one instance I was so surprised that only 1 minute had passed. At 4 o'clock in the morning we went and chilled at the train station and I was feeling pretty good again. When I arrived home at 6 in the morning I went straight to sleep until 1pm. Where I was too uncomfortable and hot to sleep anymore.In conclusions I must say that this has frightened me but it was also quite fun at the same time, I just wish that we could do it again in an environment where I could take time out and just not move at all as not moving made me feel very uncomfortable. I would have also liked to have a straight friend with me because all the people around me we're also stoned and they kept forgetting about me; or that’s how I felt. I wanted to record the affects of a huge dose of Zopiclone, so I got everything ready, including a report log I could type on as I tripped. The experience was intense and humiliating to say the least. My actual written report only goes from 6:00PM to 9:00PM, but the experience of what I did continues well into the night. I am never doing this again, but I thought I'd share it instead of letting it go to waste. First I will post a cleaned up version of my original drug log, and then I will elaborate on this and write about what happened after I left the computer. Anything added to the original log will be placed in brackets.6:00 PM – Popped 10 7.5mg Zipoclone with water. Feeling normal. I am on an empty stomach and completely sober.6:10 PM – I still feel normal.6:20 PM – I feel a bit dizzy. My hands and legs tingle.6:30 PM – I feel a bit dizzy. I am stumbling a bit. But so far I feel very close to normal.6:40 PM – Feeling zoned out. I am having trouble typing. I don't feel sleepy. 6:45 PM – I feel light-headed. Walking is unstable. I am having trouble typing and reading.6:50 PM – Movement is very rocky. I can't keep myself walking straight for long. I feel drunk without the eurphoria or sensation loss drinking gives you. Slight headache. (At this point, due to the affects of the drug, my memory will not function right until the next morning.)6:55 PM – Memory problems. I just feel drunk to the point that I am talking to myself and stumbling around. I can barely type right anymore. STRONG euphoria felt right now and it's growing.7:00 PM - I feel very giggly and happy. I am having strange brain shocks CONSTANTLY now. Eye and hand coordination is bad, and I am having trouble learning to set and use words properly. Reading is becoming difficult. I am stumbling BAD. It's easy for me to suddenly fall down now. I am giddy though, Happy. I don't feel tired at all but actually pretty energetic. (The original entry showed enough typos and mixed up words to prove my assertion clearly.)7:10 PM – VERY DRUNK, uncoordinationed, thoughts are strange. Giggling and happy, and wanting to jump around and do stuff. I feel motivated. I am starting to feel a bit tired though.7:20 PM – Same as above.7:30 PM – Popped 4 7.5mg Zopiclone. (A second dose was never intended, but I was starting to lose all control over myself at this point.) I still feel loopy and dizzy and drunk.7:40 PM – Popped 3 2mg Ativan. (I have no idea why I took this. I think I was just chasing highs now and mixing drugs for fun.) I still feel a bit crazy, and started talking too myself again. I want some alcohol badly.7:50 PM – Drank 750ml 12 proof wild vines raspberry wine. I feel very drunk and strange. I am having constant brainshocks for some reason.8:00 PM – I am getting more and more drunk. The booze in the wine is making me happy. I don't feel tired all. I am totally uncoordinated, and I can barely keep myself upright. I am getting drunk rapidly. I feel extremely happy. I have no care in the world. Everything is fine. (This entry was much longer, but so full of typos and sentences that made no sense that I had take only what I could figure out, cutting it down by half.)8:15 PM – Took 15 100mg caffeine pills.8:30 PM – Memory is strange. I was walking down the hall and forgot why, and I don't remember even writing the stuff above. I feel a bit sick in the stomach. I am doing math with limited success. (I don't know why I was doing math) I feel very happy.8:45 PM - Drunk, delirious, and trying to get a wine bottle open. (Soon after I downed another bottle of 750ml 12 proof wild vines raspberry wine.)9:00 PM – Drunk and very happy about life. I am about to show my parents my drinking problem.The log ended there. The rest of the night was retold to me by the various witnesses involved. I stumbled into my parent's room, screaming and talking randomly about everything, drunk as hell. I started throwing stuff around, swearing at everyone I met, and laughing a lot. Apparently I kept complaining of seeing visions and vivid hallucinations and it was horrifying me.I became extremely sexual, so when the cops came by I hit on them again and again, and soon they had little choice but to call the ambulance due to the huge amount of drugs I had obviously ingested. I was rude to everyone at the hospital. I pulled my IV out, pissed all over the nurse picking some stuff I threw down for some reason, and even offered to give the cops blowjobs if they let me go. The Doctors confirmed that other than completely out of my mind, I was fine to go, but my parents refused to let me come home, so I was tossed into the drunk tank. Apparently this entire time I kept asking what was going on, because my 'memory was off' as the cops said, I couldn't remember what I said a half minute ago, or even why I was where I was.He also recalled me having conversations with people who weren't there, suddenly going from outright depressed, to happy, to angry, and then back again, for no reason. I also kept asking to go to prison so I could be 'gangraped', and that I wanted to jerk off right there.When thrown into the drunk tank I took a shit all over, tried eating it and had to be tasered to stop, pissed under the door, jerked off in the tank, thrown all of my clothing off and dunked my head in the toilet, attacked a cop and had a shot of mace in my face, and I even had entire conversations with invisible people. I was out of my mind.At about 5:00 AM I snapped out of it when the drugs finally wore off, and I was confused. Due to having no memory of the night before because Zopiclone destroys your ability to make memories while on it--hence why I kept a log ready so I could record as I tripped--I was horrified. There was I, naked, in a sealed room with water everywhere, smelling like piss and shit, and handcuffed to the wall. The next few hours were the most terrifying few hours of my life as nobody came to my aid, and I wouldn't be allowed out for another six hours.In conclusion, I am not taking that much Zopiclone ever again. My memory was totally gone, so I suspect I was freely doing drugs without knowing I had just done drugs, it also caused me to snap, along with the other stuff I took, and turned me into a completely sexual nut case. High doses are apparently very pleasurable as what I wrote in the log said, but my judgment and inhibitions were so impaired I just might nearly destroy myself. When I woke up I thought I had died and gone to hell. Not fun.Much to my joy, though, I had no hangover at all! INTRO To The INTRO: This is an 'explanation' of my experience with nutmeg. I had taken nutmeg one time previously, but only 11 or so grams, which wasn't bad, but not as crazy as this time. I've had much experience with Mushrooms (about 14x or so), as well as having experience with marijuana, absinthe, ecstacy, cocaine, hash, heroin, PCP, assorted pharms, DXM, Dramamine, the list goes on.INTRO: I woke up one morning and decided to do some research on alternate ways to alter my mind. I was looking for something different. What I found was nutmeg. I read the whole FAQ and about 25 minutes later I was off to the store. It was sometime around noon when I got home with the 60g bottle of nutmeg. I wanted to be tripping by mid-afternoon so got started right away. I measured the nutmeg by placing it in a plastic cup and weighing it on my scale, making sure to put the cup on first then reseting the scale. I measured about 28g. I ingested it by 'drinking' the nutmeg from the cup in large mouthfuls, it was absolutely horrible, and washing it down with whole cups of water. Then I waited.Only The Beginning: About 2 hours after I was finished, I started to feel a buzz, sort of like coming up on a marijuana high while at the same time coming down from being really drunk. This was at about 2:30pm. This continued for quite a while and seemed like it was progressing slowly as time went by. I layed down on a recliner and watched TV for a few hours. At around 5pm the sounds coming from the tv started to sound a bit fuzzy, but would suddenly get very clear and loud. My vision would sometimes appear fuzzy at the edges, but this too was only occasional. I suddenly thought of the fact that if the trip went as it should I would need a sitter. I called up one of my friends and he told me about a party was to happen later on at one of my other friends houses. He came to pick me up and we went there to 'pregame' it. We smoked a blunt and chilled until around 7, when people started showing up. I was starting to feel very happy and started to feel the anxiety I get when I’m starting to come up on shrooms.The MADNESS: (8:00pm) It hit me like a tidal wave of psyocilbin. I was standing at a table, playing beer pong when my legs turned to jelly. My vision started tipping from side to side like I was in a room on a boat. I threw the ball at my friend opposite me and went to the couch to sit down. I heard people asking me questions but their voices seemed far away. Suddenly my vision started swirling. I could see nothing but a whirlpool of colors. This lasted for about 5 minutes, during which I heard nothing but a droning buzz. I was shaken out of it by someone hitting me in the head with a pillow. I completely flipped out and started screaming that I was tripping my balls off and to leave me alone.My friend started to apologize but a loud airplane engine cut him off. I started to yell, telling him I couldn't hear what he was saying when suddenly the engine stopped and all I heard was myself yelling, and everybody staring. They must've realized and started laughing, which made me feel very happy at the time. It started to become very warm and I stood to remove my sweater. At first I felt wobbly but then I started to feel like from my chest up was very light, but from there down I felt very heavy. I started to walk around carefully. I saw all the types of patterns and metamorphisms I see when on shrooms, but other odd things I had never seen before. Certain objects seemed to be alive, like something was inside of them and was kicking and punching them outwards. It was much like dramamine. Pictures seemed to move their eyes to me and sometimes the mouths would move. This was happening in the time between around 8:30 and 10:00.Around 10ish I started feeling sick. Things would dissappear and reappear in front of me. I reached for an unopened beer can as on previous trips, alcohol had lessened the trip drastically. It completely disappeared. When I finally got my hands on a real beer it did not lessen the trip at all. It just made me feel sicker. The room was spinning and I needed fresh air. I ran outside and into a field near my friends house. This was very stupid and dangerous and you should never leave a house alone while tripping. I laid down in the field and listened to the crickets with my eyes closed. The patterns were unbelievable. I heard a gunshot echo from what seemed like far away.I opened my eyes and looked around. The field was very large and surrounded on 2 sides by trees and bushes. The other 2 sides are a street and the other a continuation of the field. In the shadows of the trees I saw movement. Their appeared to be black creatures moving about in the bushes although I couldn't see them clearly. Needless to say I ran as fast as possible back to the house. I felt very sick and was burning hot. I heard a jumbled mass confusion of noises and voices and was seeing visionary chaos. It was like looking through a stained glass window that was shaking violently. My mental process was completely destroyed, in fact I had practically no mental processes at all. My friends told me the next day that this was around 11:30. I only remember bits and pieces from here.I remember laying on the couch with someone pouring water on my head, at least I though that was happening, other then that the few things I remember are being outside and vomiting violently. I remember tasting the nutmeg, which made more and more sick. I black out at this point. The last thing I remember is seeing a Burger King sign, about a block away from my house. Terribly dangerous, I walked the whole way home by myself. I do not remember walking into my house or anything after the sign.Aftermath: I woke up around 1:30pm on a coffee table in my living room. There was broken glass on the floor next to me, which I still have never found out what it was. I remembered the last night perfectly, up until the sickness parts. I felt sick to my stomach and my mind would not, could not function properly. I took a shower and watched tv for a little while until I fell asleep again. The tv noises were very loud although I had the volume low. I woke up sometime that night still feeling very odd. My mind and equilibrium were fuzzy for the next three days. My appetite was much lower than normal for a whole week. I would recommend this stuff to people who have much experience with hallucinogens and want to try something crazier. Overall, intense maddening trips that harbour insanity are the kind I like. I will probably try this again although I might lower the dosage a little. Might not drink as much either.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] After a five and a half hour shift at my place of employment, a bottle store/wine warehouse, I decided to drop the 20 odd mg of 4-ACO-DMT that had been lingering in my stash for around a week. It had been burning a hole in my pocket and I had been eagerly awaiting the opportunity to try it. I orally consumed the dosage at 4.25pm, after picking up a few packets of nangs (nitrous) at a supermarket. I then drove home and stopped in at work to pick up my forgotten lunch on the way. Initial effects were felt within 20-30 minutes: a slight element of nausea and a sense of anticipation. I was peaking by about 5.20pm. The effects were of extreme euphoria, walking around and dancing felt great. It was very body-orientated. I had a slight case of the giggles, everything seemed mildly humorous, although from a detached sort of perspective. I listened to a few tracks of the latest Prometheus album (psytrance) ‘Corridor of Mirrors’, and experienced sound distortions and alterations typical to tryptamines. By this point (5.40) the visuals became more pronounced and were also of classic tryptamine quality. I went into my backyard and inhaled 2 chargers of nitrous. The nitrous intensified the visuals, at the experience was similar to nitrous on 2cb although a bit more intricate and vivid. Lots of hues of purple/yellow/green. The audio effects were pretty much identical to that of nitrous and LSD although I did experience synaesthesia which was quite entertaining. By this point The Mars Volta had replaced Prometheus. I cracked open a beer, and had a few more hits of nitrous, which yielded visuals much more intense than the previous hits and seemed very similar to this although of different colours. It also had a more ‘organic’ feel to it. It definitely felt like an entity vaguely resembling the form in the link was searching or reaching out to me. I was sitting on my chair in front of my computer with an idiotic grin plastered across my face. I felt great and awed at once.I then changed the music to progressive psytrance and began to run a bath. At this point (6pm) I had a bong of cannabis with a slight amount of tobacco (I’m trying to stop using tobacco and cannabis simultaneously and cut down on cannabis altogether) which gave a slight treat to my nicotine deprived cells as well as providing a fuzzy feeling on top of the existing body high of the 4ACO. I then had a small bump of Ketamine.(6:20pm)Lowering myself into the bath was divine. All my senses were heightened. Tea-light candles littered the edge of the bath, incense was burning. I had a cold beer by my side. My small CD-player in the bathroom was the only slight downside, I’m a bit of a pretentious audio-fiend and the distorted quality of the trance was a bit painful. Yet the lovely body-high and gorgeous visuals caused me to not worry about it and go with the proverbial flow. I had a few hits of nitrous which caused similar contacts to those described above, however with the added spice of K the physical effects of the gas were greatly increased. It felt like a spiritual orgasm. The hot water, cold beer, bent tunes (I was too blissful to care about the low quality of my stereo) and happy gas all came together and formed immensely enjoyable sensations. I got out to have another bump of K and another bong hit and to get a fresh beer. I spent another forty minutes in the tub with a few more hits of nitrous then got out.By this point my mother had arrived home. (7:10pm) fortunately for me we have a close relationship and she has been through similar experiences in her prime, and she is not judgmental in any way and although she may not approve of some of my choices, she is supportive of me nonetheless. I am in great debt to her. We conversed and joked around and ordered some pizza and ate it together. While eating I amused myself by watching television (I usually avoid the moron-box) and silently mocking the travel show that was playing. Everything about it seemed to epitomize everything I loathe about consumer culture. The way the shots were structured together to make it appear like everything was happening in real-time. The acting was shoddy at best. It also enforced race stereotypes by having the Zorba song playing while a Greek chef ‘prepared’ a lobster. It was also glowing rather strangely. I enjoyed it on two mental levels, one of them was able to pick apart the cinematic and advertising techniques while the other was simply aesthetically amused by the colours of it.After dinner (8.00pm) I cleared up the candles from the bathroom and emptied the bath-water onto my garden. We endure water restrictions here in Australia, and rightly so. However it’s all too little too late and I’m not going to begin a rant about it here. This took me about forty minutes to do, factoring in breaks for another beer and changing the music occasionally. I then had another bump of K and hit of nitrous, cracked another beer and went for a walk to my local park. (9:00pm)I experienced the usual affinity for nature during my walk, the trees in the park appeared very ‘friendly’ and pretty. By the time I arrived home I could feel myself coming down, and I was also halfway drunk. I listened to music for about half an hour and then prepared a large line of K. As I shifted my CD-wallet onto my bed my headphone cord (which is very long because they are Sennheiser’s) dragged the CD-case I had the line racked up on onto the ground. I salvaged a few specks here and there but the nice tasty line had dissipated into the ether. I swore and cursed myself for a few minutes then decided it was probably for the best as I was quite drunk and was doing research on here regarding the effects of K and alcohol together. I then finished the remainder of my nitrous (I forgot to mention I’m an utter nangwhore) which yielded a great experience. My mouth hung agape and my head was thrust back to hang over the back of my chair. Music struck that funny place in the back of the head and in the third eye. I almost moaned in pleasure. I then crawled into bed and read a few pages of a book before settling into a deep sleep.Overall a very good experience, although I probably drank a bit too much. I’m 21, male, 6'4' 205 pounds Live in A Small City, Ontario Canada.I believe that everything happens for a reason, and anything can be a way to learn something that you need to remember. For me, my mushroom trip was the most alive I’ve ever been, and I think that is why my soul guided me to experience this. But, I have moved on, and I don’t need any thing like this again to be absolutely fulfilled and happy in every way. It is me that the drug affected, and there are more ways than one to reach that special place inside all love, nirvana. This is a long story but it’s a great one. ***************************************************************************I woke up one morning this spring and decided to party. My buddy had just got a huge paycheck, and we were going to live large. It was so nice outside, one of the first days you could wear a t-shirt. After cashing the check we bought a 26 ounce bottle of bacardi, some gourmet sandwiches and proceeded to get drunk at breakfast. We finished the rum, I called in sick to my night shift and we ordered a 24 of bud. High quality dope was smoked all day.Chilling on the front lawn, a bunch of friends ended up at our place. One guy sold us an ounce of the nicest mushrooms I’d ever seen. I washed down a few grams with some beer and we were having a great time. I was clearly going to have a good time and get laid by a nice girl. I took some more mushrooms. This is nothing new. I guess it was about 5-7 grams I took, but I’ll never know.I remember everything clearly, no morphing of images, no hallucinations, just advanced sensitive perception and a feeling of deranged euphoria. While tuning my guitar, I became acutely aware of my brain emitting some very weird vibrations. All of the sudden I felt very afraid. I had a feeling like something of great importance and energy was happening. I saw a lot of blue energy and realized there were aliens coming into the energy. I said aloud to my friends “OK guys, My alien friends are going to take us on their spaceship for a visit.”  I actually felt like I was moving into another dimension.Just as swift as they had come they dropped me super hard and I realized what was happening. I WAS HAVING A BAD TRIP!!! I do believe they were beings from another dimension there giving me a message about what I was experiencing. I kept saying “everything is in deja vu” over and over again. Everyone starting freaking out and I think I said something like “the aliens” can't do it anymore, I'm too fucked up” “I'm never doing drugs again.”At this point I couldn’t take it. I walked straight out of the house and immediately starting crying. The crying lasting for a long time. I just kept walking around. I couldn’t believe how horrible it all felt, but looking back on it now, everything was very clear, no hallucinations just feeling very horrible. The world seemed very different, like I was seeing more and more of the real world, and it was looking pretty dismal. I started to feel very bad about the poor people starving to death, and how much worse their “trip” was. I saw that I was going to give my life to GOD and just give up my whole lifestyle of drugs. I went back into the house and told my buddy I was never doing drugs again. I left the house and started walking towards the sun. The sun seemed to draw me in. I seemed to be possessed by the spirit of the LORD. I was just in tune with everything. I sound like I'm religious but really I just want to be in tune with the universe.I walked for a long time, just walking towards the sun. It was getting near dusk, but still fully visible. I cried a lot, and I wasn’t thinking much, I was just fucked. I felt that everything in the world was aware of me, and I of it. Actually the things that were the least aware of me were the other people. Every noise and every movement seemed to be in complete harmony, and I was actually starting to have the greatest high of my entire life. I have been in alcohol euphoria, I have binged to my every fancy. I have done coke and crack, salvia divinorum, mushrooms (one other bad trip) painkillers and the like, not E, not Datura or DMT though. This was THE HIGHEST I HAVE EVER BEEN!!! I felt if I was any higher I would just die and go to heaven.After awhile, when the sun started to go away, was when I started to get the heart pain and anxiety. The girl I was with had a similar trip on a smaller scale and she followed me for awhile but I never saw her and she went another way. She said I looked like God, walking into the sun, long hair blowing behind. My heart was really freaking me out, and I didn’t know what to do. This is horrible but funny. I think that it was somehow my destiny to experience this, because it was positive in many ways and put me in touch with a higher truth, but I definitely will not do anything like this again.I decided the best thing to do was go to the hospital. I turned on my heel and walked the other way, singing loud and proud not caring who saw or heard me. I think that hospitals should be better equipped to deal with my kind of case, and they could have been more helpful, but ultimately it was a great idea in the end.I walked in and told them what happened. I ask for a room where I could be alone, but they brought me in the huge area with only sheets for walls and people can hear everything. They put some diodes on my chest, my heart was obviously not doing something right. I started asking for a guitar?! And I told them I loved Johnny Cash and I wanted to play johnny cash songs. I wanted to help people. I got philosophical, spiritual and religious with them. I told them that everything was ok, and that everything would be fine I just needed them to help calm me down.It started out good but they couldn’t calm me down and I kind of lost it. I wanted a helicopter and I wanted to talk to Larry King. Those poor people that were trying to help me. I freaked out, too many people (like 8 nurses and doctors it seemed) and all the patients around were talking about me and I could hear them clearly. I thought I heard someone call me a jerk, and that made me feel bad because I loved everybody, even though I knew I might have just misheard. I just wanted my own room and people who loved me to take care of me. If they had of been more accommodating I would have been fine, they should have put me in the room and just made me feel comfortable, put on some Mozart, or maybe I shouldn’t have gone to the hospital, but actually I felt like god was guiding me there because of what happened later. From this point on the whole spiritual happy thing went out the window and I became a psycho.So I just disconnected the machine, walked out of the hospital, and started running. This male nurse came after me but I was running way too fast, he called my name and I just said “come on I'm going to play some guitar!!!” I ran all the way back to my buddy’s. I guess I almost got hit by some cars on the way to and from the hospital (according to several horrified witnesses). By the way, and also I was singing and telling everyone I saw that I loved them. Hahahaha But I remember I was yelling to the sky and the whole world how I felt about everything in my life. “I tried to have a good time but you sucked and then I tried to have a good time but you sucked and then I tried to have a good time but you sucked, ARRGGHH!!!!” I did feel more free and liberated than I ever can remember, but I realize I don’t need drugs to feel so good. :DSo imagine my buddy is laying down (hes got a bad back) all alone in the quiet because everybody left.  Just tripping hard like me, and I ran in the house and said, “THEY ARE BRINGING A HELICOPTER AND IM GONNA BE ON CNN!!!!!!” I was wearing no shirt with diodes all over my chest.I don’t remember the next several minutes just flashes. I remember grabbing my guitar, walking out to the street, kicking off my shoes, sitting on the curb and breaking into Folsom Prison Blues at the top of my lungs. Apparently I yelled things to people about johnny cash. The cops came and I laid down in the middle of the street because I thought they would hurt me. Apparently I hit the cop with my guitar when he forced it away. Apparently there were 7 cruisers and 2 ambulances. I started crying and telling the cops about how I lived in kenya in a past life but then I died and my poor little girl is STARVING TO DEATH RIGHT NOW. I don’t know where that was coming from, but I was absolutely hysterical about it. This time they gave me my own room in the hospital. Hands cuffed behind the back. My cock was hanging out (don’t wear underwear) and they wouldnt do up my pants. I remember getting in this huge cops face and saying, “What?!? Do you like looking at my cock? Are you gay? I kept telling them they sucked, that they were losers, and that I loved them. That one cop reminded me of Johnny Cash. They just ignored me although johnny seemed to think this was funny.After what seemed forever, they brought in a special bed that they forced me onto, and than strapped me onto. This nurse came in a needle. 8 people I think held me down and then they shot me full of ativan and another drug called hell-something. I thought great, it starts with the world hell, and I feel like I’m in hell. I told them I was going to sue them all for assaulting me, I don’t want you to treat me like this! When they made me lie down I fought really hard because it made me dizzy but I had to endure and they wouldn’t listen to me, I told them NO DRUGS!!! NO NEEDLES I LOVE YOU GUYS!!! I cursed them all as they closed the door with the plastic bubble window. And then I passed out.Waking up I felt very weak, I yelled for some to come talk to me. They had two security guards. I was strapped down for fuck’s sakes! They agreed to take one of the straps off so I could sleep on my side. Thank god a) my parents came and signed me out, saving me from the psyche ward b) my dad is an alcoholic and everyone understood what was happening and they made it easy on me. They brought me a sandwich. Holy Shit I felt kind of normal. Kind of. This is two months ago, and I am still not fully recovered, but I was in a drug haze for a long time. I have a lot of hope for a great and normal healthy life with no drugs or alcohol.They told me my heart was beating 3 times as fast as is normal and that was why they shot me up with so much tranquilizers. I could have had a heart attack. I thought I was dying but they said I wasn’t so I thought, OK Good!.My parents took me home and I was just a wreck. Anyway, the next day I walked to my friends house. He wasn’t home. I got a beer out of the fridge. I sat down and drank it. Fuck I enjoyed that beer. But that was it and I haven’t drank since. It was my thank you for all the good times I had with beer, and an acknowledgment for a brighter future. I have been in AA for two months. It’s an addictions program but basically is a society of loving and open people that are very helpful and courageous. I could have been sober without AA, but I did it basically because of a) my need to understand and reinforce information about being addicted to getting high b) my father, and c) because I was alone with my needing to be sober so I met a lot of cool, really awesome people that helped me out :DI am not against having a good time. But I am against drinking to excess on a regular basis, using drugs unless you are a complete expert on their effects, or treating people like shit because they have an alcohol/drug problem. I don’t recommend using any kind of drugs. If you want a trip, go out there and try and be as healthy as possible, do every kind of body cleanse yoga trip health trip that feels good and do things that make yourself and other people happy. That will make you feel very euphoric, and that is the most effective way of being sure that you will not have a bad trip. LOLIf you do decide to use drugs, I hope that you have a great trip and that you are really smart about how much and when and with who. I LOVE ALL OF YOU!!!  DOSE: \\xa0  oral Alcohol (liquid) \\xa0 10 mg oral Pharms - Methylphenidate (pill / tablet) \\xa0 10 mg oral Vinpocetine (capsule) \\xa0 6 shots oral Alcohol - Hard (liquid)            BODY WEIGHT:   150 lb         I've been using substances recreationally for approximately a year, including Alcohol, Cannabis, Salvia Divinorum, Amanita Muscaria, LSD, Piracetam, and finally of late, Vinpocetine on its own and a Vinpocetine-Ginkgo Biloba combo. I generally keep very detailed records of all that occurs, Shulgin-style.But this night, I had initially decided that I wanted to get tipsy. I was in a generally OK mood at the beginning (my set was decent), and the college campus on which I live is never a bad setting for the use of really any substance.The friend with me, who I'll call 'Gemini,' as that's his astrological sign, bought us the liquor and we sat down in my dorm room to watch Ocean's Twelve. I got so tipsy on some decent Sake that my social anxiety was defeated to the point where my inner, very-social self was able to express itself without fear. There's always been for me what you'd call a 'Goldilocks Zone' between being tipsy enough to lower inhibitions and actual loss of motor control and coordination. It's a fine line, but not hard to dance upon if you study and understand yourself and your reactions to alcohol closely.I was there and enjoying myself. Earlier in the day, I'd been reading about drug combinations. I wanted to see what Ritalin, vinpocetine, and alcohol would do together.So, at 7.20pm, I orally ingested a pill containing 10 milligrams of methylphenidate (Ritalin).I have to make clear at the outset, though: I know exactly what Ritalin does and the dangers inherent in it. Or at least, I had been prescribed to it for approximately a dozen years for ADD. I got off of it earlier this year because I realized that its use had been skewing the data for all my other drug experiments and that it being a part of my physical and psychological makeup prevented me from having the kind of 'baseline' personality other people do. Ritalin, I recently realized based on observations of experiments with it after I went off it cold turkey in December 2006, causes emotional instability. In high school, I would spend hours and hours inconsolably crying for lack of a girlfriend or friends. I spent about three months obsessively and emotionally controlled by the problem of proving my own existence with the same fervor and despair. But the persistent and painful worry about not having a girlfriend or as many friends as I would've liked ended shortly after I left the drug. Though I've of course found other ways to deal with these problems, the Ritalin was a major factor and I've had less trouble with them since I left it.But the trouble is still a potential in the drug, at least for me, it seems. One time during the past semester, I took a usual dose (20mg) just to see what its effect would be on me now that I've attained some sort of 'baseline.' Its effect was to engage me in existential questions like, 'What have I really done with my life? Who the fuck am I? Am I going in a good direction?' These questions plagued me until my mind felt like a large and confused knot which I had no idea how to fix (prefiguring what happens later on). In that particular situation, I called a friend of mine and he helped 'talk me down,' so to speak (this friend was unreachable for the latter experience).Ritalin, I must add, also sometimes induces a separate kind of confidence, the feeling of having all the perfect things to say at the perfect times (because of the burst of energy it gives, as well as the boost in cognitive functioning). But this function is of course regulated by set and setting, as you'll later see.Approximately fifteen minutes later, I orally ingested a capsule containing 10mg of Vinpocetine.My experience with Vinpocetine has always been good. Because of the increased cerebral blood flow, it causes slight headaches (but of a barely noticeable kind) and has always given me access to more of my memory and in greater detail than normal daily experience tends to warrant. This instills in me a kind of confidence that helps with the social anxiety, because I'll always have something to say or to comment on.  It has always inspired me to have what I call 'memory flashes,' where some association in my environment will activate a memory I hadn't accessed in a very long time, which I then remember in crystal-clear detail. It's also great because its effects are not just for the duration of its activity, I've found my memory access capability improved to an absurd degree post-Vinpocetine usage.So, I picked up Simone De Beauvoir's 'The Ethics Of Ambiguity' and began to read it in as good a British accent as I could muster, I'm not sure why. This was the first appearance of the accent which would become the keynote of the whole evening, a master weapon against social anxiety.We decided to head over to a bookstore that was fairly close by, and on the way we stopped to pick up some cigarettes for Gemini (hereinafter, 'G'). But first, I saw two friends of mine walking to a liquor store. I joined them and decided to mimic one of them, continuing my British accent.It's funny, pretending to have an accent. Everyone responds to me differently. I can be my 'ideal self,' express that which is best in my personality or what I've always wanted to be but have been too scared (in whatever way) to be and do this by means of creating an entire new social persona to associate with my 'new accent,' and I have the added bonus of getting the attention of everyone around me because of how exotic I sound. I was far more comfortable than usual with these friends, expressing myself in a dominant, confident, friendly way (all ideals of mine, the release valve for which was the Ritalin-Alcohol-Vinpocetine combo).At this point, Gemini and I arrived back at his van and I decided I was having a +++ experience, if not an 'unrepeatable ++++.' Who knows if the joy I felt will ever or can ever happen again? This is true, though the social persona which I created was the larger success of the evening.We went to the bookstore and I convinced at least half a dozen people that I was from London. All of my usual sociability that gets turned off or tuned down because of heavy introspection and social anxiety was gone, and I kept telling G that I was 'having the night of my life.'There's a distinction my theology teacher of long ago made between 'self-consciousness' (when one is utterly conscious that everyone is watching, even to the point where they can't simply act, be, or express themselves) and 'self-presence' (which is what a musician does when he's on stage and no longer worrying about if he can play this or that chord, instead he expresses himself without caring who is watching or what is going on around him) which I've always found useful when thinking about myself socially. I wrote in my journal that what I was experiencing was 'Self-presence, beautiful sociality.'When we left the bookstore, around 10.00pm, I noticed what could be called a negative side effect of this particular substance combo: dry mouth. I had been talking at a mile a minute for about three hours and there was no sign of stopping, so of course that might have been why this dry mouth occurred, but I found that even with copious amounts of water, the drymouth would return again and again. This of course could also be attributed to me continuing to speak without stopping.I arrived back on campus, and Gemini left. I was supposed to hang out with a friend who I'll call Leo (excuse my penchant for using the astrological signs, but anonymity is obviously a value of mine here), but doing so led me in a dangerous direction psychologically. At this juncture, the beginning of the wind was sown that I'd later reap as a whirlwind. I should've stayed by myself, then concerns of sexual fulfillment wouldn't have ever crossed my mind.Alas, I ended up on Fraternity Row, in a frat house at a frat party to which had been invited several beautiful girls. I should've just picked one, stayed with her, and 'taken my fill of love,' dismissing my usual concerns with beauty and that 'she must be worthy of me,' but I was so scatterbrained that my desires caused a level of frustration and anger the heights of which I seldom reach.In any event, when I first arrived at the party, I had a lot of fun, drinking frivolously shot after shot. I estimate that when I finished, I had about a half-dozen shots of heavy liquor in me. The accent was a big hit, but I was flirting with the demon Choronzon: Dispersion, no focused goal of Will in mind before me, only ever-changing forms. I had this vague inclination to want to sexually satisfy myself, but it was not focused enough to actually accomplish anything.I was so drunk at this point that a bug zapper (think of a tamer-than-usual Taser) was offered to me to hit, and I hit it not once - which was fairly painful - but twice, I don't know why. I found a corner and sat Asana in the words of Crowley 'for the purpose of thinking one thought [by in a way turning off all other functions of the body by cognition],' which means that I knelt and stayed as perfectly still as one whose cerebellum and thus coordination and motor control are brilliantly impaired.I was focused enough at that point to hear a conversation between two girls that was very enlightening. They opened up to each other, one of them saying, 'I'm sorry I've acted so strangely for the past few weeks.' This was an island of perfect lucidity in a sea of chaotic drunk moments.Asana focused me perhaps far too much, and not on the important things. Many of my social inhibitions seemed back in place after this meditation of sorts, and the whirlwind began taking over.I left the party, going to a room in one of the buildings on campus that is completely dark, where I usually go to do occult workings.So, whatever emotional instability I had could've been modified by this room's eerie temperament, though I've been there many times for similar reasons before without problem. Any Thelemite out there will see what follows as an impromptu and uncontrolled Netzach working, and will thence understand why Crowley prescribed so many rules for meditation and Magick: if it is done without strict boundaries, severe emotional/mental/psychological pain or damage may result.But this time, approximately 1.07am, my state of mind was way out of whack. I was frustrated with myself, and couldn't understand why nor could I even begin to figure out how to fix whatever was wrong. It was an impasse, and this is a common result of Ritalin use for me. It was my obsession with whatever composed my own sexual frustration that threw me into, appropriately enough, a despondent, crying fit.There was nothing but my ego, my frustrations, my feelings, and my desires at that point. I had no idea exactly what was going on inside of me, but I was trying desperately to fight the utter despair that had hold of me. Banishing by means of the Star Ruby didn't quite work, allowing my Angry and Determined Self to fight it out with whatever was hurting me through utterly forceful roars and screams didn't help, and I ended up in perfect darkness on the floor with perfect hopelessness. I had lost all control.Somehow, after about twenty minutes of yelling, kicking, and screaming, I got myself together, wiped the tears, and left the room. On my way out of the building while walking down the stairs, there was an awkward encounter with a gentleman who I can only presume worked there during the day. He noted that he had heard 'Screams and kicks' from upstairs, and that he wanted to come make sure that everything was OK. I tried to evade his questions, but gave up and decided to tell him plainly and simply that I had been engaged in 'an occult working,' and that I had been reticent to explain because I knew that the moment I did, I would lose that space.I passed out after reaching my room, still despondent but perhaps a little less so.I awoke the next morning at 7am with a bit of a hangover - not bad, as I'd taken ~20-25mg of Ibuprofen last night before sleeping - and diarrhea. By 3.14pm, I was back to baseline completely. I have always hated the taste of alcohol, so I avoided it until I was desperate.   For PAIN RELIEF !  I had recently been diagnosed with ovarian cysts and was in pain most of the time, beyond the scope of OTC meds and the prescription NSAID I had.  The doctor would not refill my Rx for Vicodin, and I was getting ulcers from the steady diet of Advil and Tylenol, so I was hurting and in need of help.  After two months of pain and despair, I was also extremely depressed and starting to break down mentally.  The pain came and went, but would sometimes stay for days and weeks at a time, 24 hours a day.  Unable to acquire any useful opiate painkillers on the net, I decided to give alcohol a try. I went to the experts (the older guys at the liquor store), and was informed that alcohol was indeed a potent analgesic.  I also hoped it would improve my mood somewhat and reduce the constant stress.  I went home with a bottle of 80 Proof Skyy Vodka and mixed it with orange juice, as one of the guys had recommended for the 'smooth, lack of taste' I was hoping for. Ugh.  The stuff tasted like poison, rubbing alcohol, and just plain SHIT!  It was horrible, but I managed to drink about 4 shots of it, gagging the whole time and washing it down with plenty of OJ.  Within about 10 minutes, I started getting a stomach ache and feeling warm, and my mood improved.   The ache passed, and sure enough, the abdominal pain went away, too!   I felt more relaxed, drowsy, and comfortable.   I also became a little dizzy, felt cold, and went to lie down.   The pain relief only lasted about three hours, though.   Afterward I felt the same as before, so I decided to try drinking more over the next week. The taste was even worse the next few times, and I had trouble swallowing it.  I tried mixing it with several different juices, to no avail.  Then I read on the net that Vodka only tastes bad because it has 'impurities' in it, and that these could be filtered out with a Brita filter.  So I filtered the rest of the Vodka and it did improve the taste a bit. I was able to drink more of it, about 6 shots.  It was worth it to get that relaxed feeling and not have to worry about the pain (or taking more OTC pills) for about 4 hours.  But I was pretty dizzy and had to really concentrate to walk straight and keep my balance.  It felt like I was in a cloud, sort of, like there was a thick barrier between me and the world.  I was in a good mood, but I didn't notice any of the other effects that I always hear about with alcohol. (No slurred speech or anything.)  I could still think clearly, and even went to the post office and mailed some stuff, talked to the clerk like normal.  (Though I felt really weird, like my head was floating.)    Then I went home and, feeling tired, went to take a nap.  That was the first time I felt the *crash* of alcohol.  I crash hard and fast!  My mood plummeted, and I felt very bad emotionally, and a little nauseated and dazed, and the pain came back full force.      I realized then that alcohol is a very dangerous drug, WAY worse than any opiate I've tried, because the sudden fall makes you desperate to feel better again, and fast.  Alcohol doesn't let you down gently like opiates do.   I understand now why it's so addictive, and it is so easy to lose track of how much you've had.  It's amazing to me now that opiates are so strictly controlled while alcohol is so easy to obtain.   It should be the other way around.I also learned that (unfortunately) I somehow have a naturally high tolerance for liquor, and that I would have to get something even stronger.   I bought some 150 Proof Rum, as this would mean that I would only have to drink a few shots of it to get the analgesic effects.   Rum is absolutely vile.  At 150 Proof, it is like shit on a stick in a bottle and on fire.   I tried holding my nose, drinking it with a straw (pulled to the back of my throat so the stuff wouldn't touch my tongue), and mixing it with everything.  Eventually I was able to throw it back with Coca Cola if I held my nose and then washed it down.   It burned all the way, and I would gag if I caught the smell of it.   I only had to drink 3 ounces of it to get the effect I needed, but they were *dreadful* ! I did this every day for a couple weeks, trying to work into a habit, but it never got easier.  Eventually I couldn't swallow the stuff anymore, and would gag it up even if I held my nose.  Thus, my alcohol adventure came to an end.  Back to overdosing on ineffective medications, still no Vicodin. I had one of those nights last Friday that teaches you to distinguish between a hard night and bad night. Breaking up with a girlfriend, that’s a hard night. A bad night is one where you’re at a party with a group of friends you’re trying to break into, one of which is the attractive girl you’ve had your eye on, when your world starts to spin you black out and wake up in the hospital.I was trying to break into this new group of friends. You know … get to know them ... make some new friends, expand my dating pool. So I do the normal party thing. Some White Russians, a couple of shots of rum, and a few beers. Then I head outside and we hit the pipe a few times. Five maybe 6 hits of some type of pot they were calling “cheese”. I’d estimate that about fifteen minutes later my world starts to spin. Things start moving as tough they’re out of a bad drug movie. And then my world disappeared. This is when I can only recount what strange thought processes went through my head and what I think happened. I passed out on the chair and was having a nightmare. I was dead or at least thought that I was experiencing death. My penultimate fear in the world is death... more exactly the unknown beyond it. This scares me out of my passed out state and I grab my glasses with both hands … pull them off my face and scream a long guttural scream as though trying to press through some incredible pain. I black out again….I recall being in the hallway crouched down with Amanda, the girl who was having the party. This part is really hazy and my field of vision is almost as though I can see my eyelids cutting off the top and bottom of my sight.“Was that … that epilepsy?” Amanda asked.I mumbled incoherently as I shook my head no. Then one of the other few familiar faces from the party comes by. The person, who brought the weed, Bill, walks into the hall and leans in.“Was it a Panic attack?” He asks.I blearily nod yes and I’m gone again. I come to in the garage. By this time though my visions must have started because all I really remember is begging Bill not to leave. I remember the concrete floor and the single overhead light. I just wanted bill to keep me from slipping back into the terrifying lack of consciousness and bizarre visions I was having. But I was gone again. This is when I start to remember my thoughts. Time was violently ramping up and down. Forward and backward. I was begging the slow moments to come. They were my chance to escape. I thought I was dead. I thought that this was what life was really all about. That it just started over and that the past and future don’t exist. Just the moment that you’re currently trapped in. The slowest moment, and when that moment would end it would all start again and start at a rapid pace until you got to your next moment which was slower then the last. I knew at that moment it was how life worked … like a giant slinky connected at the ends and when you finally reached your slowest moment the moment when you really die you start the whole thing over again. The worst part about the fast parts was that it was like falling through everything you knew or ever will know. And you know that by the time you get back to your current moment you’ll forget it. There’s one line from my visions that I remember clearly. “And now I know exactly what it’s really all about. I screamed it to myself as the thought raced by. I wanted to hold onto that thought. And then I was in the bathroom. Things in there get really strange. I remember asking to talk to Amanda. I think I thought she was an ex-girlfriend of mine named Tammy. I remember talking to a guy I met there that night named Air. I kept talking about TV shows and I think I was getting kind of touchy feely with him, which is when I think I thought he was a different friend of mine named Paul, who happens to be gay. I only remember talking abut the TV shows House and Nip/Tuck with him … I think I was trying to ask for a doctor. I tried to write something down, but it was totally incomprehensible. I knew it while I wrote it to but I just need somebody to help me.I slipped again... back to the time shifts. I remember thinking about the parallels in life … Life and Death. Black and white. Pleasure and pain. I felt an excruciating pain. Like a pinpoint of light boring through my body. I thought about vomit. At least three times that night I remember vomit going through my head. The next day I didn’t have that puke taste in my mouth or throat so I don’t think I did, but I’d swear I did. Back in the bathroom … sitting on the counter… my hair is wet. My reflection. That’s me! Gone again. Slipping through time… getting back to the new moment. Wait. Hold on a second. Amir, the bathroom … why have I been there more then anywhere else. Those are important get back there. GET BACK TO THE BATHROOM! GOD FUCKING DAMNIT GET BACK THERE! AHHHHHHHHH!Next thing I know I’m spitting at an EMT as I’m being restrained in an ambulance. That god awful oxygen mask. Get that off me … “We’re not taking that mask off. You’ve already spit on us twice,” said the male EMT. “I won’t  ... not again,” I manage to blabber out. I can remember the side of the ambulance but that’s it. And black.I remember being moved to the hospital bed and calling a nurse fat and then shoving the woman who was giving me an IV away. They made me drink charcoal. After that I was gone and remember very little. The doctors told me that from the way I was acting they think I had some X or Acid in my system. I don’t remember taking either. Maybe someone dropped some for themselves and drinks got switched … maybe I picked up a shot glass someone used to spike a drink and got some leftover. Maybe the weed was laced and I just reacted badly.I know I was VERY agitated. Very aggressive, but I knew not to hurt anyone. Amanda at one point offered or me to lie down in her bed. I refused because I knew if I went in there I’d try and do something stupid. I was on the offensive the whole time. Trying to fight off paranoia, this in retrospect is probably the most basic form of paranoia. I also remember being very apologetic, I was sorry for running the party It felt like every bad drug trip you’ve seen in a movie. When I finally was lucid at the hospital I realized that I had my wallet, but was missing my phone, keys, glasses, shoes and my right sock. After they discharged me the next morning I took a cab back to Amanda’s house to get my things. She was terrified of me. I went to hug her any she skittishly jumped away from me. I was a long night, and the first BAD night of my life. I always thought booze was harmless, but compared to some illegal drugs I've tried, it's both more addictive and more harmful. The day after New Years Eve I went on a 3-day bender, going out with friends to varous bars and drinking at least 20-30 standard drinks each night. I usually drink just beer but after about 15 beers I move onto vodka and bourbon.  [Erowid Note: The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]  I woke up each day after with a sledgehammer headache and the usual inability to stand without throwing up. The day after each bender I would start drinking at about 12:00am, to kill the hangover. This works like a charm but you miss the usual euphoric buzz of alcohol. Basically you feel kinda out of it but the headache and dehydration goes away. It's a cure of sorts. Not a good idea however. At the end of the 3rd day I decided enough was enough and drank 5 beers to try to cure my hangover from the night before. This didn't really work, just making me feel the same - like I had drunk water. I realised I was going to start withdrawing from booze after basically being drunk for 3 days, thinking that it wouldn't be that bad.About 5 hours after the last beer I started getting brain-fog. This is where I cannot focus on text at all and basically cannot read anything. I don't know where I am and my vision is blurred beyond belief. I can't do anything to cure this either, which is the worst part. The brain-fog lead into anxiety, where I started freaking out about the fact that my blurred vision wasn't going away. This got worse over about 4 days, by which time I was too scared to go to work. The thought of it made me shake and feel like something very, very bad was going to happen to me. Imagine going for a job interview and multiplying those nerves by 100, you might get close. The anxiety got progressively worse to the point where I was scared to death just sitting on a chair in my bedroom, afraid of every inanimate object in the room. By the 6th day after the last beer, I was in hell. I was basically a zombie who was terrified of everything and unable to do anything but try and sleep. Sleep brought only terrifying nightmares where strange entities screamed violent, strange accusations and threats at me. After the nightmares I would wake up sweating. Keep in mind that these nightmares seemed real and I was so zombified from brain fog and anxiety that I couldn't tell what reality was. My arms and legs would occasionally spasm and shake, which I think was the anxiety - but either way I knew it wasn't normal. I decided to get help and had my father drive me to the hospital emergency room. The nurse diagnosed me as the lowest risk (she thought I just had a hangover), so I waited about 8 hours in a hospital room with acute alcohol withdrawal while people with sore stomachs went in front of me. I started hallucinating quite vividly in the waiting room, looking at magazine covers which warped into monsters designed to scare me to death. My body felt like at any point it would start convulsing uncontrollably and I started to crave alcohol. My father was constantly badgering the nurse to admit me, but she refused. I was terrified that I was going to die in that waiting room. I kept pleading with the nurse to admit me to see a doctor but she refused. This kind of limbo is best described as hell-on-earth. It's where you know bad things are happening to you but you're powerless to act. Eventually I was admitted and saw a doctor who I can only describe as an angel. He recognized my symptoms as serious alcohol withdrawal and gave me a massive vitamin B and a 10mg valium to take while he sorted out a full-body scan to check if I had any serious problems ie Hepatitis. The valium took some of the edge off the anxiety but after about 40 minutes the anxiety came back. The doctor asked if I was OK, I said no the feelings are coming back. He gave me another valium which was heaven once it kicked in. I finally relaxed and my blurred to hell vision returned to normal. It was so smooth I realized all that I had experienced over the past days was curable! I was almost a human again. The doctor said I was OK but was surprised that I had been binge drinking so much - he thought I was suicidal but I assured him I had just partied too hard (which ironically is true). He gave me 2 valiums (little green pills) in an envelope to take home with me and a prescription to take to a GP if I needed more valium. He warned me to only take the pills if I absolutely needed them, as I could become addicted to them. He said it was lucky I had got to him when I had. The withdrawal could lead to seizures and delirium which could be fatal. He said I might need to stay in the hospital overnight, but as I had the valium to ward off symptoms we agreed it was best if I managed myself at home.After that I didn't need to take the valium, and the withdrawal effects slowly subsided. All up the serious symptoms lasted about 2 weeks, and at 3 weeks I was basically back to normal. Even still, for a while at work I would be serving beer and my hands would start shaking, but I could still function. It wasn't the uncontrollable anxiety that I experienced during withdrawal. I've drunk heavily since this has happened, and on occasion minor withdrawal effects have begun the day after - some shaking, anxiety, etc. On one occasion I had to take a valium, which is basically like booze in pill form. On another occasion I had no valium and tapered booze - ie drank 3 beers, then 2, etc to stop the minor anxiety. Other than that, I've found that I just get a bad hangover if I stop drinking after a night of partying. I think the key is not drinking the day after - otherwise my body becomes dependent on the stuff. After going on long binges I also found myself incredibly addicted to alcohol. Ie, after having a beer, all I could think about (and I obsessed over this) was having another drink. This was the only thing that mattered. This was really dangerous because after I got drunk, I kept drinking and drinking. Then when I woke up all I wanted to do was drink, etc. Luckily for me I was able to break this cycle. Overall, I think Alcohol is basically a useless substance that is far too dangerous to mess around with. These days I might drink a few beers to get a small buzz, but I'll never go back to the long binges. Alcohol withdrawal is hell on earth, where I'm turned from a human to a terrified zombie. Don't go down that path - it's not worth it.Respect Alcohol for the hard drug that it is. Well the day started out, was christmas, after opening presants and such we went out for dinner with my family(3pm). On arival we were told the resteraunt was not ready to seat people yet, so were asked to wait at the bar, so I had a pint of Guinness. We then were seated, me and my grandmother (I'm 17 years old in case anyone's wondering) had a litre of red wine between us. They took a hell of a long time serving us, during this I was getting stuck into the red wine. The portions we got were pretty small. About during the main course I ordered another pint of Guinness.After that we went home. I was feeling fairly tipsy, but clearly wanted to get more drunk. So I went round to my friends house with a bottle of mulled wine, how festive! But before I went I thought it would be a laugh to put on this tiger skin furry thong my mother got as a gag anyways. I went round to my friend's house and finished that while my friend had vodka if I remember right. I was fairly drunk by this point.I got a text from another friend who said he had gotten some pills. I was quite glad, since I do quite enjoy them. I bought five of them. I've taken pills before, as many as 9 in one night (of course through the night not all at once). I thought to myself that to get a good effect I should take all 5 at once, especially since last time I got some and they turned out to be fake. I took all of the pills at once and waited for the effects.For some reason I decided I should go home, and headed home at 8pm. From this point on I have no recollection, but I was informed by my parents. I came in, went up to my room, and sat on my laptop for a while. Apparently I was saying things like 'I CANT SEE!!!! THIS IS AMAIZING!!!! COULD DO WITH MORE!!!!' although I can't remember. My mother who was going to bed came in to my room at 11pm and found me rolling around the floor, she panicked and phoned my friend demanding to know what I had taken, and he told her to phone my dealer. My dealer told her that I had 5 tablets so she phoned for an ambulance.The ambulance came and they managed to get me downstairs into the hallway. The ambulance man tried to help me to the ambulance but I pushed him out the front door. The police then came and told me to come with them to the ambulance, I agreed and went with them. Outside my front door, with many on lookers my jeans fell to my knee's exposing the furry thong, the policeman let out a laugh and asked my parents for a belt.En route to the hospital I apparently asked the ambulance man what was wrong with the man lying down, and wether he was taking a heart attack or not. The ambulance man responded by saying that there was no one there. In the hospital I asked a few of the nurses if they wanted to have sex, needless to say none wanted to! I was asked to take my clothes off and put on a gown. I managed to get my clothes off and ended up running about naked, apparently shaking my penis at the staff and a female patient (who was apparently also under the effect of E). After another attempt at getting my gown the doctor attempted to put in an I.V drip of saline solution to rehydrate me, which I repetedly ripped out of my hand (this is my earliest memory of the events). I remember seeing the blood pouring out my hand and the saline squirting out the needle. Since I was being dificult to work with they gave me a diazepam to calm me down. Can't say I remember any diference.Apparently after the syringe was in I gave the doctor a huge lecture on the pharmacology of MDMA and telling him I was ok. On the contrary I had a resting pulse of 190 bpm (tachyarythmia), and the doctor repetedly was asking if I was having chest pain, convinced that if my pulse remained at that rate I would take a heart attack. Later on at about 3am I was becoming more consious of what I was doing. I remember walking out and asking the nurses if I could go home and they said 'no' because I still had a pulse of 190 bpm and had some sort of remote ECG connected up to me which they were closely monitoring. The next morning I was let home at 10am since my pulse had lowered to 100 bpm. Well it's been a couple of weeks since then and i've not taken ecstasy since. I must say I'm quite tempted to but I don't want to risk anything like this happening again, I was lucky not to damage my heart and I was very lucky I never got charged by the police. I recently did LSD for the second time, and also got completely drunk for the first time, so I thought I might contribute to this wonderful site. Past drug history includes a ton of marijuana (I was one of the biggest stoners in my area), more DXM then I should've done, other pharmaceuticals, opium, and amphetamine. I loved to smoke pot, but unfortunately overindulged and became blind to the world I was living, eventually leading to me getting busted. I haven't smoked in 8 months, and have 6 months more of probation, but learned a lot about myself in that time. Marijuana is my favorite drug, but now LSD ranks next to it. Past experience with LSD was approxiamately equivalent to 3-4 hits. It was overwhelming but positive, until the end when it turned downhill. I had so many questions and began losing contact with my ego, fearing I was stuck in a state of hallucinogenic psychosis. My friends told me the answer was I'm on acid, which I couldn't comprehend, raving 'you have no idea'. I freaked out, and pleaded to God to let me keep my sanity.The following week I was a wreck. It took a while to mentally rehabilitate myself. Since then I did mushrooms on a few occasions, and smoked salvia. These experiences led me to want to try LSD again. I know the wonders it can perform on an individual, and armed with more knowledge and experience I was determined to face what LSD would give me with arms wide open and a smile on my face. This lead me to my present affair. I have never been totally drunk, only buzzed due to I believe the history of alcoholism in my family and thus a high alcohol tolerance.SO THE ADVENTURE BEGINS; OUR HERO IS PARTYING IN A BASEMENT WHEN OPPORTUNITY KNOCKS SHARPLY AT THE DOOR ~ ~ ~T+0:00(8:30 PM?)- I was hanging out at my friend K's with people, and we had just aquired a 1/5 of rum. We were shooting pool, playing Xbox 360 and rocking out to Maximum Unicorn while jamming in the back room. Friends D, Z, and myself went to do some shots of the rum. I slammed down 5, and went back to playing pool. Z dropped 2 hits of LSD, and hooked me up with one I threw down on earlier in the week.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]T+0:30 - Feeling buzzed and partying to  the music on stereo, D, Z, S, and myself head out to D's. I drive S home (don't drink and drive, I wasn't drunk but one should never risk it), then return to D's to spend the night. I drove D and Z to the local Family Video, where we rented the 40 Year Old Virgin. Without much thought I dropped my hit, with rousing cheers of approval from D and Z. We return to D's, and I bring in my guitar and FX. I begin to feel flushed and happy.T+1hr - We pop in the movie while I sip on the rest of my Captain's, feeling warm, and noticing the coming up on LSD. Colors being to brighten and I get a little giddy. My friend's TV is messed up and the contrast adjusts automatically, which adds to the effect and projects me into my LSD state of mind.T+1:30 - The movie is hilarious, but time seems to slow way down. I sip my alcohol, and start drawing insights fromm the film, making connections between life and the movie, and how there are lessons to be learned. Basically cognizant and laughing my ass off every 30 seconds (which seems like 5 minutes).T+2:00 - I begin to get restless because the movie feels as if it has been on for my whole life and then some. I go piss and begin to notice patterns on my friends bathroom floor. The grey concrete has geometrical patterns of white light, now starting to move about. I think to myself 'sweet!', and go back to the movie.T+2:30 - I feel fantastic! I finish my alcohol, and the movie finally ends. The walls begin to breathe, and I feel heavy and light at the same time. I call up my friend M, and she wants me to come over, but D says 'no' and something about me being fucked up too much. I dissent like a little schoolboy disagreeing with his parents but comply (hahaha). I swing around a metal support pole and think to myself 'I'm going to fall over now', which I do and laugh. I'm having a grand ole' time.T+3:00 - Time begins to blur, like my vision is. The walls are breathing, and I begin to have dramatic visual perception shifts. I turn on my guitar and hook it up to my new delay modeler, and begin my night of electric stimulation. The music sounds so profound, and occasionally echoes and reverberates in my mind. I'm focused, happy, warm, and cognizant.T+4:00? - I don't know what time it is. As I play I create a story in my head to go with the music, and begin to narrate to Z. I'm creating universes with my riffs, an electric jam for all seasons. Everychord and note sounds so right, as if it should be. Every choice I make reflects the outcome of what I am. I change musical styles for different aspects of my world. Vibrant chromatic auras appear around objects, and Z's face is beautiful, his hair reflects the light and shimmers. D tries to go to sleep, and his face keeps shifting. I tell Z he reminds me of a lizard hanging on a rock in the desert, perhaps a Jim Morrison reference; Z was quoting the Lizard King. D remarks that I sound good, but that I have to try and keep it down. While playing I revisit my past acid experience, I become overwhelmed in a state of euphoria, realizing I have overcome my past folly, ushering a new state of openess and bliss. I have an epiphany, 'The answer to the acid question is music.' The changes in keys and syles and notes reflect the choices we make in life, and the outcome is how we view it. I have conquered the demons of past battles, and am master of my destiny, the vessel under my control as I explore the vast seas of wisdom. The poet's whim implants in my brain and throws a party. Dance the night away, maidens weep while children play? By the way you should read Henry David Thoreau, i.e. 'Walden', great book with wise insights.T+Till I go to bed around 6 AM - I play my symphony and stand in awe of all around me. I feel as though I am one with all, I thank God for creating me and letting me experience life with everyone. I narrate to Z a story of a whale, with inspiration I obtained from 'Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'. This whale is called into existence miles above the surface of the earth. As he falls he ponders life's questions and mysteries, and remarks at the beauty of creation. Instead of slamming into solid ground, I state he dissovles into the ocean and is absorbed by other living things, for their benefit thus creating an endless transition of knowledge from creature to creature.I then ramble on for another hour, and just play as I gaze at my surroundings. My vision is blurred, and I have acid vision, D's exercise equipment breathes, and his walls and floors follow suit. Artistic patterns and fractal designs dance merrily across breathing surfaces, brilliant spirals and colors shine in my mind's eye. D's body shifts and changes shapes, his face changes expressions though he is alseep. Z and I don't speak much, but we feel this connection, like 'Man It's just so amazing.''I know man.' (excellent stereotypical stoner vocab)Words don't describe the emotion and the overall fervor, so I close my mouth and let the music speak for me. I play until about 5:30 AM, then lay down on the floor and go to sleep sometime around 6.T+12:00? (around 9 AM) - I wake up around 9 as if I had blinked, not feeling like I slept. I have a headache, and the LSD effects have dissipated, except the emotional afterglow and sense of well being. I couldn't remember much of the movie, except that it was funny. This experience was much more positive than the last, and has given me an even more positive outlook for LSD.Until next time, happy trips and stay smart. I am a 23 year old female and I live in Berlin, Germany. I had began my friday night drinking with my boyfriend and some of his co-workers. We arrived at the party at about 3am or so. I was sitting out in the garden at the party and saw some guy drinking something from a syringe. I spoke with him briefly and learned it was GHB and he had just purchased it. My boyfriend thought I was asking the guy for some, but I wasn't interested in taking it...although I have always been curious about it. I had no idea what it was or what it did to people. I knew it as the „date rape“ drug though. I had been constantly drinking beer and sharing them so I probably had four large beers in about 3-4 hours or so. the hospital did not test my blood! they assumed that the info given to them by the guy who said it was MDMA or extacy, was correct, but i know it was not! i have never ever had someting even remotely close to that happen to me! i know it was GHB because GHB was at the party, the guy who gave it to me said i could sleep it off (like most ghb cases) and like i said MDMA does not come in liquid form.Upset that my boyfriend thought I had been asking for some, I stormed back into the party and danced. I saw an acquaintance and asked him how he was feeling. He said he was flying and so I asked him to get me some of what he took. He said it was „pure MDMA“. I have taken pure MDMA many times in a powder form and found it to be a great experience every time. I have never had a bad experience with it. He asked someone for me and then told me it would cost 3.50€. I had no money so the guy agreed to give it to me for free (I'm glad at least I didn't have to pay for what was coming...although I'm paying for it now) they gave me a small shot glass with a clear liquid. I would compare the amount to a soda cap full, a very small amount! It tasted horrible and I washed it down with beer. After 5 min I felt loose and was dancing freely with my arms raised, but it became too much. I was dizzy so I went out to the garden and tried to puke. I could not hold myself up and laid down, curled up in a ball. My boyfriend came and asked me if I took GHB and I laughed like a lunatic and slurred that I was ok, then completely lost consciousness. I remember nothing of what ensued after that. I woke up in the hospital. I had no idea how I had gotten there. I was alone and nobody spoke english. I puked on the floor and yelled out „Where am I? Where is my purse?“ (I hate loosing things) I was experiencing extreme spasms of (what seemed to me as) pleasure. So much it flowed through my entire body and I moaned each time. Now I have no idea if that feeling was from the GHB or the stuff they were flushing through my veins to clean me out. I knew my hand felt funny but I could not move and was laying on it. I later realized I had an IV in it! From what my friends tell me after I passed out, I began foaming at the mouth and had spit running all over my cheeks. I was dead weight and my breathing was shallow. They put me into the fetal position, held my tongue so I didn't choke on it. They took off my shoes and put ice on my feet and head (yeah, they had no idea what to do and when they didn't find ice right away they put cold meat on my head!) I'm sure I'd be embarassed if I could remember the experience, it all happened in front of a party full of people. The guy who actually provided it for me laughed and said I would be fine in 2 hours. Finally they decided to call the ambulance (it took all of 20 min from the time I took it till the time I was being carted off in an ambulance.) The ambulance came into the garden (again everyone at the party watching!) and checked me. It's really hard to imagine myself passed out and being put on a stretcher in front of a party of my peers. The paramedics did not want to hear what my friends had to say and threatened to leave if everyone did not back off. When I woke in the hospital, one of the staff asked what was up with me and the nurse told him I had taken EXTACY! The hospital did not test my blood, they assumed that the info given to them by the guy who said it was MDMA or extacy, was correct, but i know it was not. So I guess they never got the information right (all anyone knew about me was my name), mainly due to the guy who had hooked it up for me who STILL insists that it was MDMA and just a different form than he had taken (powder vs. Liquid, too bad it doesn't come in liquid form! I am just an inexperienced partier!) He tried to say I had a bad reaction because I am thin and may have eaten a banana that day...what BS! I have never ever had something even remotely close to that happen to me! i know it was GHB because GHB was at the party, the guy who gave it to me said I could sleep it off (like most ghb cases) and like I said MDMA does not come in liquid form. I don't understand why they call GHB „liquid extacy“ anyways because it is NOTHING like extacy!  At first I was a bit upset that they had called the ambulance, but nobody in Berlin really has a car so it was the logical choice. I didn't take it all too seriously after because I knew nothing about GHB and I did not remember the scary experience, but after looking up GHB deaths on the internet I am sure that I probably would have died and my friends saved my life by calling the ambulance. I was fine after sleeping half the day and went out to dinner and had a normal weekend (I quickly became some sort of celebrity after this, arg.). I was freaking out about the medical bill because I know just an ambulance ride in the states can cost a grand and I have no insurance, but when I got the bill a week later it was only 136 Euros for everything, so cheap! I learned from this that you should always comfirm what the hell your taking before you take it (seems obvious, huh?) and that GHB is a stupid pointless dangerous poison! I don't think anybody needs it. There are way better, funner and safer drugs out there. I had just gotten back from visiting my dad who is dying of prostate cancer.  It wasn't much of an enjoyable visit at all, and pretty much just consisted of my cleaning his filthy house while he lay on his chair in a drugged and motionless state.  See, the doc's got him on percocet because he hurts so much he can't even move.  Anyway, so, my dad's wasted, and it's really depressing.Since I've been interested in mindstate-altering substances lately, I figured I'd gank a few of my dad's painkillers for use later when I got home.  I put 4 of them in my pocket - they each contained 5 mg of oxycodone and, like 325mg of acetominophen.  From what I later read here on the site, percocet is not exactly the best way to get your oxycodone, since it's got all that acetominophen, but whatever, it'll work for my purposes.At home, that night, comforted by the glow of my computer screen (sadly, it's the only friend I know since I moved from my hometown), and hoping that maybe these painkillers could help me to forget the depressing events of earlier in the day, I prepared myself for dosage. 20mg seemed like a safe dose, and since I'm a pretty big guy anyway, I figured I'd be fine.  Just to be even safer, I decided to only take 10mg at first.  This being my first time taking painkillers I was really scared and almost didn't do it, but I chased the fear away and just swallowed two of the pills.  I chilled out typing to friends on AIM, and playing some guitar.  I just tried to relax, and go about the night as I usually would.  About 30 minutes later, I started feeling a slight buzz.  For some reason, I wasn't scared at all anymore, and I somehow knew that I was going to be ok, and that this was going to be an enjoyable experience.  My guitar playing soon turned to shit, however, and my sense of musical pitch was thrown way off.  ha ha, I just put the guitar down, and stood up.  THAT's when I first felt it strongest.  After about 45 minutes, I figured I wasn't going to get any more buzzed than I presently was, so I took the other two pills.  My dosage was up to 20mg now.  I don't remember getting any more buzzed, I just remember the good, floaty, light (some say they feel heavy, but I swear, I felt light as a feather) feeling staying steady and lasting longer than I thought it would.  And that whole bit about the itching, VERY TRUE.  I itched all over, but strangely enough, it wasn't annoying, and it felt really good to scratch it.Then I made a bit of a mistake.  I thought I felt the effects of the drug wearing off after about 3 hours, so I thought I would try a beer to boost it.  My previous knowlege of mixing alcohol and painkillers being a bad idea totally didn't matter at this point, and I'm glad I only took ONE beer.  That one beer was enough to make it so I had to literally fight myself to keep my eyes open.  I noticed this strange effect with the lights too:  I would see quick flashes, like I had a bad fluorescent bulb, or something.  Things would get suddenly bright and then dark again.  I don't know if these were actual visual distortions, or my eyes being heavy and then opening suddenly, and then drooping again.  I was so out of it by then I wouldn't know the difference.  Also I started seeing things.  I kept thinking I saw bats out of the corner of my eyes or something.  Just paranoia, I think.Overall though, it was very relaxing, very pleasant, and I didn't want it to end.  I didn't have a care in the world, and it was honestly the first time in years that I didn't feel the least bit stressed out and run ragged. I wouldn't drink alcohol with them again, and shouldn't have in the first place.  In fact, I wouldn't take these pills again for a very long time.  I could see myself getting hooked, and the last thing I need right now is a drug addiction! It was a Saturday and I knew I would probably be home all day. So I picked up 2 grams of marijuana and decided later that night that it would be fun to drink a little and smoke a joint. The bud looked and smelled of high quality, very dense, light green and covered in orange/red hairs. I don't often drink and smoke at the same time, and heard that it is better to drink before you smoke.I rolled the joint first, so it would be ready immediately after drinking. It probably contained about half a gram. To give you an idea of the setting, I live in a house with two floors. I was downstairs, the rest of my family (parents and sister) were upstairs sleeping. The downstairs is pretty big, much of it is open. On one side there are no walls dividing the dinning room, living room or kitchen. On the other side, from the kitchen there are two doors. One leading out to an enclosed porch area, and the other leads into a fairly big room with the computer and some other crap. The other part of the downstairs really has no relevance to the report, but it is the laundry room and a furnace.I poured myself a margarita from a pitcher that had been mixed earlier that day by another member of my household, and added some extra tequila to it. I downed that at about 12:40. I did this in the computer room, and walked into the kitchen to get a beer. I got one and returned to the other room when my dog approached me and began barking to be let out. I walked through the kitchen, directly into the dinning room where the main door of the house is. I put the dog on her leash and went to the room I left the beer in. I opened it and drank it as fast as I could. I put the can by the sink and went to let the dog in.My front door doesn't exactly open quietly, and is right next to the stairs. After I let the dog in my mother yelled down to me asking if I let the dog in and I said yes and everything went back to silence. It was probably around 12:50 now, and I was defintely feeling the alcohol. There was a mild feeling of warmth, enhanced mindset and I felt more open. It was time to smoke the joint.I walked out into the porch area, which I would have to describe as being half inside-half outside and pretty dark. I always smoked out here, it was on the other side of my house, opposite my parents room so they wouldn't hear or smell a thing. The first few hits felt very relaxing and my thoughts began to flow easier. I took a few more hits and went to the door to make sure no one was downstairs. All was clear, but I heard my cell phone ring from the computer room, which is only a few feet away. I went to get my phone and to my surprise it was my freind whom I'll call D.I hadn't talked to her in a while, so I answered the call and asked what the hell she wanted. It wasn't just D, but also her friend B who I don't like very much. After talking to B for a while I realized I was VERY stoned and just didn't follow her very well. My joint kept going out while I was talking, so I had to re-light it a few times. B then put D on the phone and I listened to her as I continued taking hits. Turns out she was drunk and high too, so I felt some sort of a connection. I don't remember much of what we said, only that it may have made sense in my head, but probably didn't at all to her. I told her that I wanted to finish my joint and that I would talk to her later. It was only about 75% smoked, and there where a few good hits left. I happily took them.It was now about 1:15. This is where things are going to get a little fuzzy. All that I remember of the night is like a dream, and it is hard to tell the order in which things happened. I remember that I felt higher than I had in a while. The feeling was somewhat like I was dissociated from the world around me, kind of like it feels on DXM just not as sick to your stomach. I could feel most of my body, but it the same time it didn't really feel like it was there. My mouth was very dry, so I think at some point I got a drink.I went back to my computer, checked my buddylist. Not many people were on, and I don't remember talking to anyone. Thoughts were randomly flowing through my head, I wasn't completely sure what I was doing and it was as if all of my thoughts were in the third person. Like I was reading or dreaming everything that was happening. Something made me want to have another beer. I got a beer, opened it and started drinking. I think this is when my dog approached me again. I put the beer down and pet her. When I stoped she would bark. I gave her a treat, and she quickly ate it. I walked off into the laundry room. She followed me. It felt like she was fucking with me. Like she knew perfectly well that I was fucked up, and she was doing this for entertainment. But she was only a dog.I think I walked into the bathroom now, the bathroom downstairs was a fairly small room connected to the living room. I had to pee, and did so. I also think I lost the dogs interest. After I was done, I went back to finish my beer. Took the cans and went into the porch area where they belonged. Closed the window, swept any ash on the floor away, went back inside and locked up.Not sure what time it is now. Felt like I had to pee again and went to do so. This is when I started feeling sick. Too damned lazy to stand, so while sitting on the toilet I began to feel dizzy. I really felt like I had to pee, but I couldn't. So I sat for who knows how long, thinking of how dizzy I was. I became even more aware that I was thinking in the third person. I finally got up, and went to the kitchen to get a drink. Some sort of a lime drink that didn't taste all that bad. Had two glasses and went into the bathroom hoping I could pee now. This time I kept the lights off, maybe it would keep the dizzyness under control. I closed my eyes and put my head down, losing track of time. Eventually I began feeling nauseaous, got up and vomited into the sink. It was a bit chunking, green, burned like hell and much of it shot out of my nose.I sat back down on the toilet trying to pee again, and trying to clear my nose. At last, I did and felt somewhat better. I then proceeded to take a shower. Afterwards I felt cleaner, but very tired and still pretty dizzy as if the world was spinning. I got dressed in the bathroom and then threw my old clothes into the laundry. I then remembered I put some marijuana, rolling papers and my grinder into a draw of my computer desk. I went back to get them. At some point before all of this I must have already shut the computer down.I walked upstairs, put away all my paraphernalia and went to lay on my bed. I must have fallen asleep rather quickly. The last time I looked at the clock somewhere between all of this it was about 2:20, so I'm not entirely sure what time I went to bed.Intuition must have awaken me. It was 6:30, I was sobered up but lethargic. I went downstairs, into the laundry room and checked the pockets of the shorts I wore to find my other gram of marijuana and my glass bowl that I didn't use that night. Went back upstairs, put them away and went back to sleep.The experience is now burned into the back of my mind like a dream. Throughout the night I remember having what seemed to be pretty messed up dreams, but I can't remember any details and its all like it was blended into the night. This is pretty much how my memory is, and its not a problem. I smoke marijuana pretty frequently, have done ecstasy almost every other week the past few months and occasionally smoke crack. Very rarely do I drink. Everything that happens to me, everything I say and do is somewhat of a dream to me. I can remember things that happen, just not in very much detail, or the chronological order of the events. I like it though, and may do this again sometime minus the beer after I smoked.Hope this was useful someone out there. This report documents a very hellish night with a bad combination of drugs.  There was this big party at my friend's house and I had been waiting all week to get messed up and have a good time.  We started it off with smoking some good weed in the late afternoon.  We smoked heavily until we started drinking around 8pm.  Nobody had really arrived yet and we wanted to get a little bit of a head start.So we started drinking a lot of beer and I got drunk very quickly.  We then smoked more weed, and by now I was willing to try anything.  I decided to eat the mushrooms(approx.9:30 pm) I had been saving for a while to liven up the evening a bit.It is around 10:30 pm now and the mushrooms have had no really profound effects yet, until now.  I go up to a room with some friends and sit around a table.  I now realized I'm messed up because the wood grain on the table is now moving due to the shrooms.  Next thing I know somebody busts out some Oxycontin, which I had never tried, but had heard about through the news.  I didn't know really how it was supposed to affect me, but in my state of mind I didn't really care and was willing to try.  I snorted two lines of what I was told was 80mg of Oxycontin.  I did it quickly, not knowing what lay in store for me.I started feeling pretty good now for the time being.  I was seeing visuals from the shrooms and the Oxy was making me feel very strange.  I had a body high and could hardly move, also my mouth felt very strange.  Like this weird tingly, slightly painful feeling around my jaws.  I remember just being so immobile and just staring at shit, hardly being able to hear people talking to me.  Just in a trance.We left the room and ventured downstairs and I immediately plopped myself on the closest couch.  I was really messed up and I hardly knew what was going on.  Ok, this is what I remember before I passed out or whatever happened to me.  I was walking around and I was in one room and next thing I know I feel a rush of all sorts of things and I am now on the floor in the kitchen.I regained consciousness, but had weird fucked up vision and then I saw the blurred images of people standing over me.  My eyes would not go into focus for several seconds.  They told me I fell backwards from one room and knocked my head hard on a cabinet and then on the floor.  They also said I was twitching or having a seizure or something while on the ground.  Nothing like this has ever happened to me and I have never had a seizure.I struggled to get up, but could not move.  A couple friends helped me up and led me over to a couch to go to sleep.  They said I was out for 2 minutes and everyone was very scared.  I threw up 4 times through the course of the night.  The back of my head ached with pain.  I also could not stop waking up at all odd hours of the night.  I think I was partly afraid that I might have a concussion and I always had heard its bad to go to sleep like that.  Now I don't know if that is a bad combination to use shrooms, oxycontin, and alcohol, but my guess would be yes.I'm glad I had some good friends to help me out.  So please let this be a warning and never try this combination.  After all this people were telling me they thought I died and crazy shit like that.  The next day I felt like my head was empty and I didn't really feel like talking to anyone.  Well that's about it and I will never try that shit again, but will probably keep trying new things as I have found. Well I should start of by saying all dosages are prefaced with 'at least'.  I make this point because I still don't entirely recall how much of what I had that night beyond a certain point.  I do know the dosages listed above where at the minimum what I had.This experience took place about 1.5 weeks ago. I'm 21 and until the past year I was a firm anti-any type of substance believer. That being said the past year has been experimental and I have done things I regret I hadn't looked into before hand. The main reason I write this is I hope somebody someday will come across this account before they do something without knowing the possible results.  I came here looking for help to piece together my experience and found reports I wish I had read. So here is mine:The night was a usual one for me and one of my two roomates: Lots of cannibus. We chilled out for a while and my friend who does a lot more and has tried a lot more (subsance wise) than I have asked if I wanted to get down on some valium with him. Not really knowing what it was I agreed after trying to get a few details out of him. One- because I had never heard anything especially negative about valium before, or anything for that matter,  2- I didn't want to appear the 'chicken' (I realize this in retrospect) and 3 - because I had been itching to get into something more shall I say 'altering' than cannibus.So he had a small sheet of them and gave me two and he took two, which we took orally. They were white so I suppose they were 2.5mgs each. This was about 11:00 pm.  After a little while I broke out the Blackberry brandy and we polished it off. I just filled up the empty bottle and poured it out into cups to see how much it was, I guess I had about 2 cups worth since it was just the two of us. We did it shot by shot and after the first couple combined with the cannibus they rest of the alcohol went down supprisingly easy for me.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]Around 12:15 am we went out driving (mistake #? of the night) to a friends to get some more valium. By this time I was feeling something, which was if nothing else the alcohol but I suspect the first dose of valium had started to kick in because I recall feeling quiet complacent with everything. Including the fact that at some point I was driving very sporadically as was my friend.When we got back home I remember that I had started to snort at least 2 more of the valiums, as I saw my friend doing it earlier, though my first 2 I had taken orally.By 1:00 ish I only have partial comprehension of what is going on because I had a lot of alcohol (for me) and the valium had made me very VERY complacent with everything. We are driving, almost hiting guardrails, going off road etc. But it was weird because my feelings towards what was going on were very 3rd person. Like I was aware that some things were not right but I didn't particuraly care.This is about as much of the night as I remember. After this point in the evening the next thing I remember is waking up in the hospital with an iv in me. People that were aware of what happened that evening thought it was maybe for dehydration. I refer to these people as opposed to what the hospital said because the hospital treated me like an animal and would not tell me anything short of I was allowed to remove the iv and other patches and such stuck on me. And that I needed to leave immediately - as I repeatedly tried to find out what the hell had happened and where my friend was.To wrap this part of the experience up, I sustained only superficial wounds meaning as bad and as numeriful as they were nothing serious had occured to me. However my car's clutch was completely destryoed, out of gas and numerous parts had been stolen in the time between me being brought to hospital and the tow company being called (air filter, cd player) Also to this date there are large scratches running from the front left bumber to the drivers side mirror that have yet to be explained though it looks like we had hit a guardrail or something not a direct hit but had drove up along side of it or something. My friend had been arrested for driving under the influence.The main part of this story or what I want to say to anyone considering using valium for first time: be careful about mixing it with alcohol, and beware of extreme complacency. I say this because that was the main feeling I had from what I can remember. I just remember realizing I was snorting a substance into my nose, when a year ago I hadn't as much as touched a cigarette.  Its the worst feeling in retrospect because I remember thinking at one point how great it was to not care about anything and that I would have (and may have) done any substances available at the time.As far as physical effects, my friend told me I had completely went down like I had no control of my legs when I stepped out of the car, which is weird because while I was sitting I had no recollection of a feeling of loss of muscle control. Like I said I didn't sustain serious injury that night but I feel I was very lucky because we were driving around quite drunk. Which I feel awful about the more it sinks in- the lack of concern about anything extended to possible consequences and to what might happen if we were to endanger anyone else.I don't recall much of what happened between the point when I snorted the valium and waking up in the hospital aside from a shocking amount of complacency. I don't know if it was because it was my first time or becaues of the alcohol I had that evening but my friend reports aside from throwing up all over myself, driving erratically, and collapsing, I was 'speaking in tounges' to this date I have not been able to get much more out of anybody.I am just trying to warn anybody who might be looking into using it. not because I think its bad but make sure to think twice before you mix it with alcohol and make sure you are with people who wont let you make bad decisions, i.e. driving while boozed up and under the influence of valium for the first time. It would seem that I am very biased now towards using valium, and for the most part I am. There is the potential I feel for stress relief - just know what you're getting into. Sunday, the Dave matthews concert. After arriving, we find a lawn spot and chill out. I take about two hitters of MJ, and maybe 4 or 5 shots or vodka. This put me in a pretty happy go lucky state, and I could easily distinguish the different effects from each substance. After a few hours, this started to wear off. We made our way to the gates, and I had maybe another four shots. I hardly felt this. As the opening bands played on, I had a few cigarettes and more hitters. Also some more shots, and a few beers.It began to come to me. As soon as guster started playing, I began laughing. Everything was funny. I could not stop laughing, no matter what I did, how hard I tried. I was sitting down, and put my head between my legs in a semi-fetal position, and just laughed. Occasionally I looked up when someone talked to me, which made me laugh more. I just could not stop. Soon enough, my world as I knew it began to swirl, and I was begining to SEE the music, though my eyes were closed. The music swirled about, in the sky, through people, around my head. After having one foot in the water of this new reality, a pang of nausea hit. Not so much nausea, but a erupting feeling, which obviously came out in the form of multiple occurances of vomiting. This didn't feel great, so I remaining in the fetal position, oblivious of the outside world. Slowly, the elements that consist of my humanity began to dematerialize. In my new world, I watched my brain slowly break apart, as if it were some picture on my computer, and pixel after pixels just broke off and dissipated. First went my non-essential emotions, anger, fear, jealousy, dismay, apathy. These were first, and where I was, were non-essential to the human exsitance, and if anything, made things worse in a world that could be perfect. Next, comprehension of sight, sound, and feeling left me. Next, happiness, love, excitement, and energy left me. Slowly, as my brain de-pixelated, my body lost its essence, and I became nothing but an empty shell.  All I had was my basic motor skills, which were not so great either. I was nothing. I had been deconstructed. My brain, my body, my soul, my essence, and my humanity. The world meant nothing, and I sat, head between my legs. I should have been scared, but fear was not even an emotion. Emotion did not exist. This was the core of being. This was it, the center of everything. I pondered this alternate universe, and explored what I was. What I was, my past, my present, meant nothing. I looked up, and around. Now everyone was standing, but this meant nothing. It mean nothing in a sense that it did not make sense to me, and I could not comprehend the point of standing, of being, of dancing, or kissing, or even the point of names, clothes, hair color, height, width, or the indivdual character that we all are. I did not know what confusion was, so it meant nothing. There was no way I could respond. I put my head back down. Slowly, my core senses began to rematerialize. Sight, feel, and sound was slowly starting to come back, and had an increasing feeling that it should mean somthing, that I should be reacting to it, but I still did not have my emotions. I began to notice people around me. People were trying to comfort me, and hugging me, telling me it would be fine. One girl in particular, who I did not know, was very helpful. She told me I'd be fine, and held me from time to time. I was not scared, but everyone must have assumed I felt like crap and drank too much. I was not scared, and in fact, was begining to understand my mental trip. I also noticed people stepping on me, tripping over me, and even I kick to the ribcage from someone. I could tell I was kicked, but pain did not exist, yet. This is when it began to really come back. I felt angry. Not that I was kicked, but that someone dare ruin my mental voyage with a careless swing of their leg. My energy came back. My motor skills began to come back. So I stood up. I looked around, like a newborn. Wow. I just could not understand all of this. I looked at the stage, at the lights, and at the screen. Wow. I looked around at people dancing. I noticed girls with guys. One in particular, entangled in his arms. I always like this girl, but now, it did not matter. I did not understand why they danced, or why they kissed. Some of my emotions came back, but the non essential ones did not. They just danced, and I knew, that normally I would be mad, but now I didn't care. It was bliss in the form of pure ignorance. I remained standing, and closed my eyes. Again, I could see the music in such forms and colors I was astounded. My sense of belonging did not exist, and I stood, gently nodding my head, one with the music. The CEVS continued through the concert, and I slowly began to get into it. I danced, and sang, but I was still coming back from wherever I went, and was not yet grounded. I missed a chunk of the concert, sitting in the fetal position and in my own world, and was somewhat remorseful, but I beleive that what happened mentally was so positively insightful that it outweighed that in value. To others, I might have just looked like I made a fool of myself. But inside, I was reborn.After the harsh breakdown of everything I was, I was born again, as an empty shell. Much like an infant, I did not know how to react to this weird world, and did not know of emotion past that that was neccesary. I had to look, live, and learn everything again, and rebuild myself, to come back to the world I know.  To break down the human mind this much, I could better understand how we work and why we think what we do. And though this probably took quite a toll on my body, I have been reborn, and feel great. I have never had such a reaction from just alcohal and MJ together. This was more of a trip than a high or drunkeness. CEVS and very minor OEVS. It was very insightful, but the intensity and vomitting are not something I would like to repeat but whatever. Party on. If you have never been to downtdown Brussels, you should see it sometime.  My favorite place is a really famous square called the grand place, it is surounded by old gothic buildings.  Personally its one of my favorite places to chill even though there are a lot of people there, even at night.  Anyway, the old buildings and such give the place a great atmosphere, it makes me just look around and check out the architecture and chill.My mindset was that I was eager the whole night to smoke up, but I couldn't find anyone with bud.  I finally saw an senior who graduated the year before and I knew him from a school team.  The only preparations I had made for the toking was to drink 2 pints of beer and have part of a shaker.  I wasn't anywhere close to drink, or even dizzy or anything, I just felt pretty chill.So as we were smoking the joint, I probably had about 6 puffs, not a lot, but there were like 4 other people there.  It was only bud, not hash.  I smoked some hash the weekend before and that was pretty intense.  Immediatly afterward the effects were about the same as drinkin 3 cans of coke, in other words, close to nothing.  When we were all picked up by my friends dad.  I got in the very back of his mini van since I was going to spend the night at my friends house and therefore get out last.  I felt fine, I didn't have to try hard and fake sober or anything like that.  After a little bit, maybe 5 minutes of driving in the car, the weed hit me.  I was almost blown away because the expierence was so unexpected.  When I think about it now, the weed must have been on some kind of time release, or maybe the alcohol had affected the timing or something.  My legs felt pretty warm, my thighs where paralyzed with a nice warm sensation.My stomach hurt a little bit, just a tiny pit sensation, nothing compared to when I smoked the hash, but I had eaten a pita kebab about 15 minutes before smoking up.  The car ride became more and more entertaining.  My head wasnt immovable, but I couldn't move, it could only move when the car turned.  On really sharp turns I felt the car was tipping over and driving on the two side wheels, or even that I was in a plane or flying saucer and I was doing a barrel roll.The most recognizable part of the weed was that it made my body feel like it was glued still, and even if I tried I couldn't really move it, but if I did move my head or whatever, it felt amazing. During one part of the ride, I experienced something new.  I had a throbbing sensation in my head, but not a hurting one, one that throbbed of gluey warmth.  There were three points of these throbs originated from in my head. One above my right eye, one on my left temple and the third on the left sideof the back of my head.  The only thing I could think of as describing it was the word triforce.Anyway, the triforce thing was not too intense, it was just new to me so thats why I was so interested in it.  Later on I started thinking about what the fourth dimension was like and what would happen if a fourth dimensional matter came into the third dimension.  Something must have triggered a memory involving the book flatland, so thats where it must have come from.When we dropped off the first guy, he was fine.  When we dropped off the second, he must have been tripped up cuz he couldn't find where to open the door.  I laughed to myself when this happened.  When I came to my friends house where I was sleeping over, we took off our shoes and went upstairs and such, all was fine, I still felt cool.We went upstairs to his room and listened to some metal music, and for some reason my friend opened up to me like he had never done so before.  I mean it was just like he started talking about everything.  I don't know what made him talk like this now, since he wasn't stoned, or even drunk, maybe a little tipsy, if at all.  It all gave me one of the warmest feelings inside I've felt in a while.  He discussed some metal songs and I found out he actually liked some ballads, and I mean I guess they spoke to him in a way or something.  I always thought that he didn't like anything that approached the sound of a soft song.The whole night was pretty chilled out, and relaxing.  Definately one of my favorite expeirences, even though the trip itself wasn't anything special.  I am still amazed at how much of a difference a little bit of weed can make to a night out. I had just recently had my medication upped from 300mg to 400mg a day and really hadn't noticed much of a difference. Since I had no problems previously going out and partying while on Wellbutrin, it didn't even cross my mind to be concerned. I only found out after the fact that Wellbutrin can reduce your alcohol tolerance.I'll preface this by saying that I am by no means a stranger to alcohol. I'm a college student and have been drinking since I've been 15 or 16. Never had any problems really, made an effort to keep myself from doing anything really stupid or drinking way too much. Even so, I tend to drink around 7 or 8 drinks on average when I go out and I'm able to maintain myself pretty well. I've never had a full out blackout like I had this night.At the second party we were at that night, I'm guessing I was on my 4th or 5th drink. The last thing I remember is talking to some familiar faces and working my way through the party (I was aware of my drink, I know it wasn't drugged. That's not how these people roll anyway.). Almost complete blackness after that except for brief moments of consciousness where I remember puking and having my friends help my back home with only one shoe and a disconcerting amount of blood on my white coat. (I think it was from my toe? Not sure.) I had no idea what was going on, where I was, I didn't understand anything. However, it was pretty hard to think at all so oh well.Once we got back to my dorm I remember my friends telling me that if I didn't stop puking they'd have to call an ambulance. I laid on my side thought that I was probably going to die, go to sleep and simply not wake up. Apparently I kept telling them I was fine and they should go home, but they stayed around and tried to figure out if I would keep breathing. In all honesty, if it was someone else I probably would've wanted them to get medical attention, but I'm very glad that I was just left to be and didn't incur a bunch of hospital bills.It does say on the bottles not to drink alcohol while on the medication, but I really hadn't noticed any side effects while drinking on doses up to 300mg. That extra 100mg makes a startingly huge difference I suppose (combined with the fact it completely shreds your appetite). I don't think you have to completely abstain while on bupropion (although shrinks would prefer us major depressives to quit in general),  but be conscious that it can bite you in the ass very quickly. It seems that just one extra drink can just push you off the edge. Be careful if you must. I was in my local supermarket and was walking through the tea section when something caught my eye. One box was labeled 'Kava Tea'. Remembering reading about kava kava, I baught the box and returned home. each teabag contained 78mg of kava root extract, so I decided to drink 2 bags worth and see how I was feeling. About an hour after drinking the two cups, I felt very relaxed. I decided I wanted to go further though, so I made 2 more cups. While the tea bags were soaking in the hot water, I took a shot of vodka. I felt the affects immediately, and just had to sit down. Then I chugged each cup of kava tea. Half an hour later I was sitting on my sofa loving everything around me.I was having affects similar to marijuana. I was so relaxed at this point that I decided it would be a good time to meditate. Before meditating though, I helped myself to one more hot cup of kava tea, which I drank slowly. The meditation was amazing, I had several out of body experiences, and was at total peace with everything around me. When I was done meditating I had a beer, and then chugged another cup of kava tea. Lying in my bed before going to sleep, I slowly sipped my last cup of kava tea as I listened to relaxing music. Then I lay down and fell asleep immediately. In my dream I remmeber thinking to myself: 'Am I in a dream? Whoa, I am in a dream.'I had alot of fun in this dream of mine because I could control my every action, and even the actions of those around me. It was like playing god. I went on adventures, took huge risks knowing that I wouldn't die, and just had lots of fun. It was like I had rented an immortal god's body for one night. Truly an amazing exerience.The next morning when I awoke, I was the most refreshed and relaxed I have ever been. I just lay on my bed for a while, in a peaceful state of mind. I highly recomend kava tea, it was very enjoyable and relaxing.  I will definately do kava again, but I'm going to wait at least a month so I can appreciate it as much as I did last night. Along with seasonal allergies, I'm allergic to pet dander, and knowing that I was going to be at a house with both dogs and cats, I took 50mg of Benadryl following my daily dose of generic Claritin-D (240mg Pseudoephedrine/10mg Loratadine). I also brought along an additional 50mg Diphenhydramine in the form of generic OTC sleep medication, just in case I was there for longer than expected. Antihistamines don't usually make me too drowsy, but do put me in a somewhat surreal state. Over the course of a few hours, I consumed no more than six beers, and in place of the usual dreamy feeling I felt more alert than usual when drinking which I attributed to the antihistamines. I felt no sinus or eye irritation, but had the usual increasingly worsening respiratory irritation.When I was leaving the party I got into a lengthy conversation with a friend of mine outside the house. While I felt soberly coherent in thought and speech processes, I realized that the external world was noticably taking on the antihistamine surreal state in full effect. When I got home I inhaled a dose of Albuterol for respiration, and took 400mg Ibuprofen with water in anticipation of any hangover effects. Despite my exhaustion I was unable to sleep, as everytime I closed my eyes I was surprised to find that I was having vivid CEV's. I'm a regular lucid dreamer, and I'm experienced with recognizing and manipulating the hypnagogic state, but these visuals had some other source. Upon closing my eyes, I was experiencing full-blown scenes of increasingly disturbing realities that would shift with threatening form constants.Despite my efforts I could not gain control and benefit from these visuals, and I began to feel an intense anxiety, similar to the onset of a bad trip. I immediately sat up and turned on the television in an attempt to ground myself to something external and constant. The sense of impending doom eventually passed as I occupied my mind as much as possible. I was completely bewildered at the events I had just experienced, and eventually passed out to the droning of an infomercial. Usually following a night of drinking, I will have extremely negative dreams beyond my control, if any. Despite that fact and the preceeding negative experience, I had a full night of many different lucid dreams, none of which were negative. Throughout the night I woke up many times (which attributes to disrupting and prolonging REM periods) and found that I was more dehydrated than normally after drinking, especially for the relatively modest amount I drank. In the morning, despite my frequent trips to the sink throughout the night, I awoke completely dehydrated: headache, dry mouth, and extremely chapped lips. I attribute all the preceeding events to the combination of antihistamines mixed with alcohol. This was the first time I experienced this combination, and certaintly my last. I was fourteen the first time I had come into contact with alcohol.    The setting at a graduation party for someone in my extended family.  I had been taking an acne medication, Minocycline, for approximately 2 months in addition to Claritin everyday.   Up until this experience I had been totally straight edge...I didn't like hearing about people drinking because it was something that I always wanted to do but couldn't.  Not because I couldn't physically drink but because I had been an 'outsider'.  Raised as the youngest boy on my street I was picked on and by all the older boys.  I didn't drink, smoke, or have sex, and any other sort of psychoactive was absolutely and totally out of the question.However, this night at the graduation party marked a shift in my values in terms of drug use.  No more than 5 minutes had we arrived my father told me to grab 2 plastic cups.  Curious from the request and feeling overall anxious like I always did at these types of events, I grabbed 2 cups and handed them to my Dad.  He gave me a cup back and said 'Follow me.'  The party was still very low key as not many people showed up, and as soon as I realized we were walking to a large garbage can filled with ice and metallic keg in the middle, my anxiety for the party vanished and was replaced with a feeling of curiosity and nervousness.  I had never been so excited in my entire life... After some simple instruction on the use of the keg I filled up the red cup with my first beer and continued to take a sip.  I had tasted beer before, but that was just my Dad's and didn't mean anything...this tasted entirely different.  Not because it was a different type of ale, but because this was MY beer.  The psychological effects took hold immediately.  I felt older, I felt more mature, I felt like I had left behind my old dorky self and evolved into someone that people  admired and wanted to be around.I hadn't had much to eat that day and was in a positive mood because I had spent the day at a friend's house away from my parents.  Conversation became more interesting, and different points of view during a conversation astounded me, however simple the difference in perspective was.T+ 0:01 I start to feel excited and euphoric, this party, unlike all of the others where I spent hours feeling miserable, had suddenly opened up to me and I wanted to be involved.  My beer is still half full but I want moreT+ 0:08 I finished the first beer and as a novice drinker start to feel 'effects', however small they wereT+ 0:10 My Mom doesn’t know whether to be shocked or to laugh and I'm just content that I'm drinkingT+ 0:16 2nd Beer finished.  So this is why they call it an innebriator huh?  I try to balance myself on one foot, and manage  it for about 7 seconds before I almost knock over a neighbor.  I try to add numbers in my head, but any numbers who's sum was over 200 proved difficult.  Alcohol doesn't make me stupid, it just dulls my ability to remember what I was doing 2 seconds before.Alcohol changed my way of thinking.  In sober consciousness, my brain will move from one thought to another, slowly and in a way where I can tell what I was thinking before the new thought.   (Cause and effect) A stimulus causes a thought which can cause a tree of thoughts.  When I am drinking alcohol, I forget what thought came before in a very short amount of time. (With later uses of alcohol at high doses I've found it extremely difficult to remain on topic during a conversation with anyone sober.)  Also, little nuances and things that might make me classify in my head  'funny' but not make me physically laugh are now evoking laughter or giggling.  T+ 0:25 (Third beer half-way gone) I begin to think my neighbor is an asshole when he says that he can play drums as well or better than Ringo Starr. I become very aware of the music selection at this point and go up to the DJ to request some music  to make the party 'The best fucking party ever' I believe I said to him.T+ 0:35 Beer is almost finished and it's time to eat.  I feel a strange urge to eat lots of food.  I fill up my plate to the brim with all sorts of BBQ, potatoes, fruit and jello.  The anticipation builds extremely as I'm waiting for people to move so I can get to my seat.  I imagine that's what 'munchies; must be like for people who use cannabis.  Every bite of food is better than the last, the sweets are sweeter, and sour cream of the potatoes tastes better and the BBQ sauce on the meat tasted like liquid gold.T+ 1:00 Starting to feel a bit uneasy, I'm angry that the alcohol's effects are starting to wear down considerablyT+ 2:00 Back at my house I play pool with my mother.  I don't feel the primary effects anymore but my sense of accuracy seems messed up.  I feel more clumsy at the table than stable, and the whole game pisses me off.T+ 2:30Primary effects have worn off, however a new feeling of happiness sets in as I look back on the night.  I sleep on my stomach 99.9% of the time, however I slept on my side that night because my neck is extra-sensitive to touch and makes me feel very mildly like I want to vomit.  Sleep is substandard, and the rest of the day I feel almost 100%, but not QUITE there, motor skills feel every so slightly impaired, as if I had very very minute tremors during movement.  Effects declined as the day went on and non-existent 24 hours after alcohol use.  And that concludes my experience report of my first alcohol use ; ) 4:00 PM: Friends arrive, start on 40 oz. Budweiser.6:00 PM: Friends return.  Consume 1/2 of Budweiser 40 ounce malt liquor.6:30 PM: Friends leave, as I'm finishing last half of Budweiser 40 ounce7:00 PM: Down first Soma and one Vicodin, and first Loricet chased with Budweiser malt beverage.7:30 PM: Down second Soma, second Vicodin, second Loricet, chased with Budweiser malt beverage.8:00 PM: Finish Budweiser malt, down 50 mg Butabital and third Loricet with it.9:00 PM: Am starting to feel drowsey; not with the alcohol or opiates alone (which I'm used to downing morphine sulphate with 140 proof+ Absinthe anyway), but I experience a sort of 'leaning' sensation; as if I'm actually drunk.9:30 PM: I decide to call my dealer to ask him for more Barbies...please.  Forget the morphine, the mushrooms...nevermind my stash of 'sinthe and 2-CE; just give me some more Butabital, tonight.  No luck, have to wait until tomorrow.9:45 PM: I call my dealer AGAIN...please, more Butabital.  No luck, just gotta wait.10:30 PM: Am losing intoxicated state, crack open a spare bottle of Rinfrescante.  This state is similar to the state induced by MSContin x Absinthe, to an extreme.11:00 PM: Have finished the first 750 ml of 14.2% red, am cracking the second.12:30 PM: Have finished the second...effects of the pills have nearly worn off.  Am starting to feel the GI-related side-effects of alcohol and APAP over the alcohol.1:30 PM: Decide to take a moment to fecate; feces leaves strands of red (more of a burgandy than crimson)...obviously serious GI altercations, but no yellowing of the skin differs from any possibility of serious infection.  Small (~1/4' diameter) scabs are also apparent.4:30 AM: All effects of alcohol have faded, am simply hungover at this point.  Feces is 'foamy' and somewhat dissatisiying at this point. Spring break had finally descended upon my friends and I, and like any ordinary suburban citizens, this was a perfect justification for immense consumption of narcotics and other fun substances. Coupled with the fact it was T's birthday, we needed nothing further to make us gather in 'The Spot' where our ritual blazing festivals occurred. We packed a bowl with some fresh and luscious Vermont-grown herb, which was still sticky and wet. The bowl was transferred from hand to hand among five people, each of us struggling to detain the potent vapors within the confines of our defenseless lungs. After about 4 hits, an unusually small amount for me, my cheek muscles began to involuntarily twitch, the telltale sign my body displays to let myself know that I'm high. Next, I downed 4 bottles of Smirnoff Ice in the midst of a body high that can only be explained as oversaturated pulchritude. As the alcohol and THC mingled happily together within my synapses, waves of gorgeous chemical pleasure assaulted my brain and perception mechanisms. The simple task of focusing became literally impossible. I felt that if my eyes stopped moving, I might miss something, and so, I sat there for about 5 minutes shifting my eyes as fast as possible, never actually seeing anything at all. My perception of depth became completely compromised, as objects in my retinas were always closer than they appeared. This effect cycled in and out in overwhelming waves that I thoroughly enjoyed. Throughout these glorious minutes I laughed ceaselessly at the fact that we as humans are conditioned to believe that such experiences are evil and sure be avoided. Nobody can tell me that what I felt was wrong, evil, negative, detrimental, or bad in any sense of the words. I was where I wanted to be, forever. I became very aware that my usual veil of self-consciousness was slowly being dismantled. This process became oddly tangible, as bricks of my shield were smashed away by rushes of THC and its alcoholic sidekick. I really enjoyed not being bothered with the complications of a conscious thought process. My brain was existing in a pure and quintessential form, and I loved it. I said anything I felt, and I did anything I wanted to.Suddenly I became very loving and sexually aroused. I began carressing and feeling one of my female friends who had been lounging in my lap. I felt so close to her, so amazingly connected. Our bodies meshed together in a form of sexual fluidity as we rubbed each other and smiled happily. I had no previous interest in this girl, and it was then that I realized that she looked a heck of a lot better than usual. I didn't like that, for no other reason than I just did not like the concept of thinking and making rational realizations. I opened my eyes around 6 or 7 minutes later and realized that I had forget to finish the end tail of a blink. I had actually forgot to open my eyes. I realized that when my eyes were closed and I just absorbed the energies and sounds that were filling the room, my high was a lot more enjoyable. My friends were crawling all over and engaging in all sorts of odd and hilarious antics.  My friend A had an M&M suit on, and was galantly screaming some hip-hop lyrics. The very visualization made me laugh harder than I've ever laughed before.Before I knew it, two hours had passed. I can not stress my altered perception of time enough. Literally, I had thought that 30 minutes, MAX, had passed. It was the weirdest feeling ever. As people began to gradually depart the gathering, I tried to calm myself in an attempt to psychologically contribute to ending my high's reign, but to no avail. My friend D and I discussed pointless and random issues such as the spelling of the word 'four' and why the hell it has an 'F'. These conversations left me short of breath and rolling on the floor in a fit of hysterical laughter.Eventually I returned to my normal state and slowly made my way home. It was a very fun night. Hello, I am writing this report about mixing alcohol with 2C-T-21. I have tried combining alcohol with 2C-I, AMT, 2C-T-2, and a few others, and the second that the alcohol hit my stomach with those substances, I and several others that I regularly tripped with immediately felt nausea and/or vomited. So it was known to be a bad idea to drink while tripping in my group or circle of psychonauts.So anyway, one day I introduced a friend who is a very heavy drinker to 2c-t-21 and he loved it, but he told me that he drank a lot of Jack Daniels during the trip and it intensified the effects for him. I just thought that he had an iron stomach from drinking all the time and the effects were all in his head, but I eventually tried this combo with an moderately strong dose of 2c-t-21(I never used an accurate scale as I am very familiar with how 2c-t-21 effects me), and found his statement to be true. I started drinking shots of whiskey in the middle of my trip and the alcohol didn't cause any nausea at all like the two went together perfectly. Shortly after drinking a few shots I got this burst of tripping really hard, and the strange thing is that the alcohol added like a very strong speeding sensation like I just downed a bunch of amphetamines, huge waves of tingly energy. I couldn't believe how hard this combination made me trip, it's like the alcohol multiplied the effects of the 2c-t-21 in the same manner as with opiates or benzodiazepines. The trip lasted the same amount of time maybe a little less than usual as it seems that the liquor pushed the chemical through my system faster. I just thought that this combo would be interesting to note because alcohol does not seem to have this effect with most other tryptamines and phenethylamines. So booze is legal and everyone does it, maybe its not as exciting to think about as other drugs, but a drug it is. I had decided to get drunk, very drunk, to see what it was like. Somehow, regarding the booze as purely a drug and not just a drink made it more appealing.In the weeks prior to this event I had tested the water, as it were, by getting mildly drunk a few times, on various drinks. By mildly I mean so that I could easily control myself still, but could fall into the drunkenness if I let myself go. I researched alcohol and its effects, both mental and physical, learned about it, and decided that I would go ahead with getting completely drunk.The friend with whom I intended to get drunk with had been drunk before but never to the extent we intended to be. We looked around and found prices of different sources of alcohol, looking for the cheapest price per amount of pure alcohol. I bought a 750ml of whiskey from a local shop and hid it in my bedroom until I was going to use it. During this time I sampled a small amount of it, perhaps 30ml, not much at all. I found that it tasted very bad, but drinkable.One Friday evening my friend’s parents had gone out so we decided to get drunk then. I went round to his house and we got straight to it. I was feeling a lot of excitement and anticipation for what was to come. Everything felt good and right to do it. This was 2 years ago so times will not be quite accurate. At about 6.30 we both drank half of the whiskey, which was about 360ml each. That is about 80% of a pint. I downed it all in one go to make it easier, but it still burnt my throat terribly. I almost threw up into the sink, but held it in. The desire to vomit quickly passed. My friend drank his and we washed the glasses and put them back. We went and watched TV and just hung around his house for like 15 or 20 minutes. We decided to go out and walk around the streets for a bit. We went out and walked and talked, and went to like the centre of our suburb. It was pretty quiet, not many people were around but it was very warm and light still. We were wondering when we would feel anything; it had been about 30 mins already. It was suggested that we go and buy some more, but instead of turning down towards an off-license we continued on walking. We went into a supermarket and looked at the alcohol, considering whether or not to buy more. About that time (T+45mins) we begin to notice some effects. Just a feeling of happiness and well-being. Jokes brought about a lot more laughter than usual. So we concluded that we wouldn’t need any more booze, and continued walking on. The effects came on quite rapidly after that. The happy feeling increased, and everything felt fun to do. If I let myself go I could lose some physical control and start to stumble, but I could still pass as sober if I wanted to.We headed back towards his house, cutting through a graveyard as a shortcut. Here we began to fall about laughing in the grass, not caring where we were. From here onwards my memory is a bit sketchy, but I will tell what I remember.We made it back to his house, he walked up his drive and got to the door and I was behind him and kind of ran into him, we both laughed and he pushed me and I stumbled and fell through a high wooden fence separating his house from his neighbour. The fence collapsed on top of me and I crawled out. The neighbour came out and I seem to remember apologising and helping him stand the fence back up. I then ran out into the street and back into my friend’s driveway. I have a clear picture of running back towards his house; everything was black and white for a moment.Inside we fell about, knocking furniture over and such, it was all very good fun, and everything felt great. I remember that several times we would try to get through to each other, saying “Sober! Sober!” For a few moments we could drag our rational minds out of our drunken state and communicate seriously about what we were going to do, but it was like holding a heavy weight; very soon you had to drop it and we would return to acting like fools.We headed for his parent’s drink cabinet, and drank an unknown amount of other spirits. I remember we drank a lot of amaretto between us. My friend dropped the bottle on his fireplace and broke some tiles. I think maybe we broke a table in his house too.We went back outside, where it was still light. We went and called at the house of this guy we used to know. His mother answered the door, and we managed to act sober – he wasn’t home anyway. We walked around a bit more, it was like watching the world through thick glass. Not because my vision was obscured but because I was just a spectator in what I was doing. I think we may have been talking far too loudly, as someone looked at us rather strangely from across the road. I had an urge to hit my friend, I don’t know why. I kept hitting him playfully on his arm, I wasn’t in control. I really remember very little past here. I’m pretty sure we went back to his house for a bit. After that the next thing I recall is being in a local park which is about equidistant from our respective houses. It was dark so some time must have passed. I estimate it was about T+3 hours. We fell around on the grass, no one could have seen us so it was ok. We tried to break through again, “Sober! Sober!” which worked for even less time than before. My friend had to get home before his parents did.I woke up in the park and he was gone. The next maybe 30 minutes were spent waking up in different places around the park, trying to walk, and then just waking up somewhere else. I have some flashes of memories of walking home. When I made it home my parents were in the kitchen. My bloodshot eyes were noticed, and then my behaviour, and basically I got busted for the whole deal. I don’t like to recount this part of the evening, as it is the extremely bad part of the whole memory, the first half being extremely good.I threw up soon after getting home. The next morning I was still a bit drunk, but had no headaches or aversion to light as is traditionally felt after a binge on alcohol. I was sitting in my room that morning when I imagined the almond taste of the amaretto I had drank. The taste was vivid and real, and I again vomited. I had previously liked an almond flavour, but even to this day I am not entirely comfortable with it.Being found out by my parents was an intensely uncomfortable situation, and no one ever mentions it still. It was an awful end to a truly great evening. It would have been wise to have a non-participant with us that night, so prevent us from doing anything dangerous for example. I do not in any way regret the experience, indeed I am extremely glad I did it. Since that day the alcohol I have drank totals about 3 glasses of wine. I haven’t really drank since, nor do I intend to in the future because unless I want to get drunk, I have no reason to drink it. And I have not felt any real desire to get drunk again, mainly due to health and fitness interests. Recently however, my interest in drugs has been rekindled and I intend to get drunk to a similar degree sometime soon, just to remind me what it is like. The heavy is drinker is an unusual thing.  The ability to consume large amounts of alcohol with minimal side effects for one thing, and the general apathy for all things non-alcohol related, such as sobriety or responsibility, and especially finance.  At first one might withhold from purchasing liquor on a Wednesday night, work the next day, cant budget beer into this week.  But then comes the inevitable slip, 'oh its just one day, if I drink today I wont drink on Friday.'.  'Oh, it's just one more day, I can take the weekend off.'.  5 days later and the bottle is still filling itself, and it's a surly hungover Monday.  The only thought on the drinkers mind is how nice it would be to have another drink, to skip the hangover.   Monday night comes and again the drink is present, without hesitation.  Suddenly it’s been two weeks and the drinker is still at the table, never willing to give it up.  'It's all right, I have lots of money to throw around,' they say.  'It's just one beer, it's just three beer, holy crap I’m drunk lets get wasted, oh crap its 730 and I don't know how I got home, time for work, take a shot before I go,'.  This is the exact routine I followed into my brief stint as an 'alcoholic', in which my 'disease' took the best of me. I would like to state that I am an experienced veteran when it comes to drugs like pot, mushrooms, MDMA and alcohol.  But even in my most extreme ecstasy binges, I have never felt so bad as my alcohol abuse.  It started as a regular Saturday, and I was in BC visiting a friend who we will know as R for a number of weeks.  She was still in high school at the time, and I had already been graduated for a year.  Seeing as she was in school all day, I was bored of pot because of its constant supply, and I had absolutely dick all to do, I started to drink during the day.  I had already gained a rather large tolerance from my 2 month every-other-day binge, so a mickey a day(12 ounces) was only a moderate buzz.  So I had been drinking pretty much 12 ounces a day plus whatever beer I had been able to get my hands on for the past couple of weeks.  It was the weekend so I figured I might as well go all out for a 'party' we were to attend.  Saturday night came and I had already finished 3/4 of a 26 ouncer (I had previously drank the first quarter the night before), but I had started drinking around noon so I only had a moderate buzz.  Being the genius that I am, I decided that rather than just getting 6 beer or a mickey, another 26 would be fun.  We proceeded to consume our consummate amount of 'panty-remover-in-a-bottle' in a park because the party had been cancelled.  When I was about a third of the way through my bottle, we decided to go crash a bottle.  At this point I had a moderate drunk going, and felt as though I could consume the rest of the bottle without question.  Sure, I could have, under normal moderate circumstances, finished the bottle, but these were not 'normal' circumstances.  We arrived at the party only to find a bunch of emotionally bitter annoying 16 year olds drinking beer and smoking their 'GRAM'(very small amount of pot, laughable from a potheads point of veiw).  But being as loaded as I was, I decided to party anyways.  From here on my memory becomes rather foggy.  By this time I had about half of the 26 left.  If I had stopped here, I would have finished the night and awoken with a moderate hang over.  But of course, being around other drunks, and being particularly drunk myself, I gave into the pressure to chug as much of the 26 as I could.  Of course, I had been drinking heavily for the past 3 months of and on, so 8 shots went down easier than water.  I gave the remaining four shots to my competition, and he, upon completion, purged his stomach of fluids on the wall, the carpet, and his cat.  Apparently after my consumption, which had now reached 40 ounces of whiskey throughout the day, I gave away a quarter ounce of high quality marihuana(I mean HIGH!!) to an asshole, emo, skater kid, because I had threatened to fight him (I am not usually a violent person, unless I am shit faced).  By now everyone was annoyed with our presence, either because of my seasoned drinking skills, or perhaps because I had threatened to fight the owner of the house hold because his hair was blond.  From third hand accounts(the two friends I was with), I walked to the door, took about 6 steps onto the lawn, and passed out.  I remember none of the events past this point.  Fortunately, for me the friends I was with would not leave me for the seagulls, they took it upon themselves to drag me up an incredibly steep hill, probably about 200 feet high and 400 hundred feet long.  Long for a sober person, imagine the struggle two drunks would have carrying 145 pounds of dead weight up a hill at a 45 degree angle.  I awoke the next morning on a towel covered in my puke, and climbed into my friends bed.  Several hours later, still drunk as all hell, I again awoke, this time to learn that I had relieved my bladder in my pants, and was completely unconscious the night before.   I was faced with a 36 hour hangover, but no puking, to my surprise.  I had obviously poisoned myself, but because of my tolerance, I was still functional.  This was not to be the case next time. Several months later, at R's graduation, again in BC, we were to attend an after party, a wet grad, so to speak.  We awoke the Saturday morning after an incredibly divine mushroom trip to the shouts of R's mom.  Time for grad.  The only thought during her 5 hour excruciatingly long grad was whiskey.  Finally it came time for me to purchase the goods, so I, in good alcoholic fashion, decided to purchase a 26 of Jack Daniels and 12 Sleemans honey brown.  I thought, 'I haven't had a good drunk in some months now, might as well go all out.  Now, in the previous months, this amount would have seemed feasible, but seeing as I had been working heavily for the past two months at a physically demanding labour job, I hadn't been drinking.  So I started at about 2 PM, with just a few drinks, and felt the buzz come on rather quick.  This is going to be a good night, I thought.  We arrived at the party at around 7 o'clock, and the last memory I have of the night was at 9 o'clock, going to blades.  I awoke at 4 in the morning in a tent, and the first thing I saw was the bottle, still half full.  I had no idea how I'd arrived in the tent, I just knew that I had to go back to the party to finish my bottle.  I would like to add at this point that I am from the northwest territories in Canada, known as a drinking hole.  So my actions seemed perfectly rational because of past experience.  I arrived back at the party, and proceed to chug the remaining bottle.  Anyone who has chugged 12 shots in a half hour span whilst still drunk as fuck, knows the impending consequence.  I have about 10 minutes memory from this sequence.  Apparently, from third hand accounts, I filled up my empty bottle with beer from a keg, only to become dissatisfied with the taste and pour it out immediately afterwards.  The owner of the keg didn't like this, and he told me.  Now the owner was probably 6'3(from what I hear), and I am a measly 5'7'' 145 pounds.  When I am sober I can take on pretty much anyone because of my martial arts training and my natural reflexes, but because of my extreme drunkenness, one punch from this grizzly man put me out cold.  I have dream like sequences from the night, and as my memory served me, I remember screaming for hours because I had been left in a swampy area next to a fence in the middle of nowhere, and apparently some girls(who sympathized greatly for my efforts), took me back to my tent.  I awoke the next morning covered in water, absolutely soaked and feeling as though I had fallen from the sky head first.  My friend R's mom came to get us and we packed the tent up without commotion.  During the ride home I felt extremely drunk and sick, upon arriving home I stayed in the bathroom puking for 6 hours, nonstop.  I would take a sip of water and then puke up more than I had drunk, including endless dry heaving.  At some point I had to get on the bus for a 32 hour ride homE, and in waiting for the bus, I puked in the stations garbage can, in the parking lot, in front of the bus, and in the bathroom, all this taking place before the bus had even left.  I continued to dry heave for the next 12 hours, until about 7 the next morning.  At this poiont I was extremely dehydrated and weak, but managed to keep down a Nestea for about an hour.  Despite the extreme agony I suffered from the puking, my body felt otherwise fine.  No headache, no cramps, no fever, just puking.  Even though I was in such an extreme condition, I managed to meet and girl who we will call L.  We instantly clicked, and spent the next 7 hours on the floor of the bus frolicking and making out.  Of course, every hour or so I would have to get up, puke, brush my teeth, and drink some orange juice, but the experience was still memorable.  Finally at about 5 o'clock the next day, upon arriving in Edmonton to meet another friend, J, I was able to eat some food.  This event marked the first time I had eaten anything since the night of the shrooming.   About 3 days without any food, just mush and alcohol.  My stomach was rather happy to have this food, and I was able to enjoy a beer with supper.    Despite the girl on the bus and the warm meal, this experience was the worst overdose of alcohol I have EVER had, period.  During my constant vomiting I wished many times for my life to end, even a few times considering suicide.  Luckily, there was no possible way I could kill myself in the state I was in. I was too sick to even move my head.  That experience was the last and final draw.  I vowed to never again drink myself into oblivion, and to control my drinking.  I thought that giving up drinking would be to admit defeat, and to this day I stand but eh same idea.  I have learned the art of moderation, and it has treated me well.  Although when drunk, the thought of dying doesn't occur until the day after, which makes it so much more incredibly frightening. As correctly expected, there was some hard toll to pay for the excess that I logged in.  Biologically, I am an alcoholic, yet I often go for very long periods (months) without getting drunk and even for years without going on a binge.  As my 'drinking career' has progressed, though, my body's ability to process alcohol has certainly changed.  In the present case, I had the following experience:Initially, nothing much different than a regular hangover, other than particularly heavy sweating, some quick heartbeat.  But,  far, far worse (because not present in mere hangover) were the psychological effects of what is clinically known as 'major withdrawal'  Terror and (what I found worse) auditory, tactile and visual hallucinations, which were sometimes indistinguishable from everyday sounds, feelings, and sights (these included the humming of bees, the dripping of water, the strange reflections of light), but sometimes utterly surreal and nightmarish (morphing shapes and certain creatures that all humans deeply fear and revile), and it was these that produced sudden and even greater near-total confusion, heavy sweating, and frenzied heartbeat rate.  The onset of auditory hallucinations began exactly 24 hours after my last drink.  All especially horrifying because there was no drunkenness to mask them:  they appeared in the light of day and instantly led me to believe that I was going insane.  Thank heavens I had spent the last few of those 12 days tapering down, and I had eaten a lot the day before cessation and had taken mega-doses of vitamins, and had drunk much juice and water (and, needless to say, no alcohol).  So, I lay in front of the TV in order to keep my mind somewhat focused on a fixed REALITY -- a surrender to stream of consciousness (i.e., sleep or dozing) would have entailed (so I knew from previous binges) very, very nasty things -- which nevertheless visited me, yet in a previously unknown intensity.  The worst period occurred during a period of about 4 hours between hours 42-46 after cessation of drinking.  This began with the visualization of geometrical patterns -- not so bad.  But the visions quickly became ones of putrefaction, horrendous scenes of decay and filth, worms squirming from eyeballs and the like.  I found myself writhing and trying to focus on thoughts of my loved ones in order to dispel these visions.  Scorpions, snakes, all of these things, just dropping onto my bed.  I would swat at them, only to confirm that they were not real, yet the momentary terror became manifest.  I kept seeing the extremely rapid descent of something down the outer edge of a heating pipe that runs through the ceiling of my bedroom down to the apartment downstaris.  This went on for four hours, yet it was an eternity.  Forty-nine hours after cessation of drinking (right after this most terrible withdrawal), I fell into a deep sleep.  All in all, classic alcohol withdrawal.  Yet, when it happens to you, there's nothing 'normal' about it.During Days 3 and 4, I did achieve the sought-after state of 'clarity.'  I was able to discourse on philosophical topics (I am a philosophy professor by training) with remarkable precision and even insight.  This state, I suspect, is perhaps a ruse of the drug, occurring exactly when neurochemistry has more or less successfully adapted to the drug.  On the other hand, I might be wrong, as people on very, very long stretches of addiction also report achieving such a state.I got through it, but it was the most horrendous 24 hours I'd ever experienced.  Think you know what 'hangover' is?  Good.  I curse the day that this substance came into the world. I began taking Effexor under the supervision of my psychiatrist in order to relieve an episode of major depression and also to try to put a handle on my social anxiety. After 2 weeks I reached a dosage of 150 mgs per day, where I have stayed. The Effexor was very effective in relieving my depression - I felt like I was on my way to getting better instantly, as soon as I took the first pill. It however did little for my anxiety, which I still suffer from. I have been a daily marijuana user for some years and I noticed no difference in the effects of smoking while on Effexor. Before taking Effexor, I hardly ever drank, because it was not enjoyable for me - I would drink two drinks and then fall asleep. Drinking did not help me much in covering up my social anxiety.  But on Effexor, drinking became my favorite activity.  On Effexor I can drink all night long – and it is incredibly rewarding. Alcohol in combination with Effexor turns me into a social butterfly with incredible energy. No longer do I pass out after consuming alcohol. In fact, drinking in combination with Effexor is so rewarding that I feel that I have become addicted to alcohol. Once I begin drinking, I cannot stop, I feel that I need more and more alcohol. After I’ve had a drink, all I can think about is having another one – I feel like I am fiending for it, similar to the feeling I had when I had a problem with cocaine. Although Effexor’s manufacturer states that Effexor is not contraindicated with alcohol, the manufacturer “recommends avoiding alcohol” while taking the medication. I could not find any information as to WHY it is recommended that people avoid alcohol, but maybe Effexor contributes to alcoholism in some people. I am submitting this report as a warning to those taking this chemical, especially those who have had problems with addiction in the past. I see in myself a pattern of behavior that is not healthy and difficult to control. Then it became my 'soul's face' again and it jumped back into my body. After that all I could hear was Jim Morrison's voice going 'Insanity's horse adorns the sky, can't seem to find the right lie, carnival dogs consume the lines, can't see your face in my mind' over and over and over'I stood up and went to G's room and laid on the couch while G, C, E, M, D and RJ laid on the bed.  Suddenly the door opened and it was N, he was crying, nervous and shaking. He went to the room were we all were talking and laughing at ourselves. He slammed the door and started to freak out. 'I can't deal with this anymore, I can't handle this, I'm going nuts, my head it's all fucked up' etc This is when my trip turned absolutely crazy. I was in the couch and I was upside down, my feet were on the wall and my head was sort of tilted. I felt my eyes coming out of my face, I moved and then I sat normally. N started to yell at RJ 'you got to get up, you have to help me with this they went to the bathroom but the door was open so we all saw what was happening in the bathroom. N took a huge ass bag out of his pants, it was full of everything, little plastic bags full of weed, crack, pills it had everything and he gave it to RJ. 'Sell this for me; you're going to have to call a bunch of customers.' and he gave him the bag and a phonebook. They got out of the bathroom and RJ was freaking out, N took out a gun and started to pointed at himself, he was crying 'I can't do this anymore, I'm way too fucked up, I want to die' RJ didn't know what to do and he tried to tell N to give him the gun so he could be killed by a professional killer. N was going crazy and he pointed the gun at everyone of us, screaming at each other and crying hysterically. At that moment I had a feeling that someone was sticking their high-heeled shoe into my hand. But I couldn't feel it. I moved my hand and they were wet (that's what I felt). I was seeing fire and N's face looked all blurred. I was freaking out. I tried to tell C what I was feeling but I couldn't manage to articulate my words enough to do so.RJ and N were arguing for a while. I think it was 4:10 when they left. We all decided to smoke a blunt at 4:20am and play traffic lights (where you can't exhale until the blunt gets back to you)' I went to sleep at 4:45am I had to sleep on the floor, I was still tripping really hard and I felt really uncomfortable on the floor so I started to think that I was sleeping on a cloud, it felt so good and nice, I wasn't cold or hot, I wasn't happy or sad, I wasn't here or dreaming, when all of the sudden I began to cry, I was bowling my eyes so hard that I had to go and wake C up. I hugged her and told her how bad I felt for this kid N. We were sitting on the closet in front of G's bed we were crying so hard that he woke up and gave us a hug and something to drink. We fell asleep probably at 5:30am. I had the weirdest dream ever. I woke up at 11:00am on Sunday and G was crying in the bathroom. Everyone woke up, RJ never got back. We didn't know what had happened the night before until M told us that N killed himself. It was sad, crazy and unbelievable. D, B, J, C and me went to Denny's to get something to eat. When we got back to G's apt. the police was waiting for us. I was so scared because I'm 17 yrs old, my mom didn't know what I was doing that night and if the police would've found any kind of drugs in G's apt. they would definitely send me back to Colombia and messed up my residence papers. They took us and asked us a bunch of questions individually. Nick (N) committed suicide on June 22nd while he was on acid, crack, xanax, alcohol and weed. Rich Bonet (RJ) saw him shoot himself. The police found the gun in the pond because RJ panicked and threw it in the lake. That whole entire week (June 21-June27) was the craziest and fucked up week I have ever had in my short life. Now every time we smoke a blunt, joint, bong or we take a shot we do it in memory of Nick. We all went to the memorial which was pretty sad. All that I can remember now is his face when I was in the couch upside down. I could see really weird shit. Like the bullet from the gun penetrating my brain and blood all over. I saw everything and everyone in cartoon form. When we were smoking our last bowl at 4:20 I felt how the smoke intensely filled up my lungs. I remember every single detail.  I have also had flashbacks, trails, and mild ego dissolutions since then, that was the last time I tripped.RJ left and E became our new drug. G got kicked out from his apt. and he's now living with at E's house. The rest of us keep smoking and trying to live.I sincerely hope this will help somebody in some way. Know yourself and your environment. Don't do too much shit! Enjoy life and be happy or die trying.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  I was prescribed 10mg Stilnox (known as Ambien in America) for insomnia.  At that time, it was my first encounter with this drug and I had never heard of it before.  I was trying to get some benzo's off my doctor - serepax or mogodon or even valium, but I have a history of addiction so he prescribed me the Stilnox instead.  He said it was safe and not addictive.  So I took the script and got the pills, but I just didn't take this drug seriously.  I thought it would be like some of that herbal shit - like valerian or something.  How VERY fucking wrong was I!When I got home I took 4 of the pills (40mg) because I thought the prescribed dose of 1 pill would do nothing.  Kind of like the prescribed dose of valium is usually 5 to 10mg, but I need to take 40mg to get high.  I drank this with 1 glass of weak wine and went to bed. I had no other drugs in my system.This is where it all went very wrong indeed!  I closed my eyes, and in what seemed like an instant, I opened them and was somewhere else.  I thought I must be still dreaming because I was in my car near the highway on-ramp, parked sideways in the middle of the road, and this tall blonde woman was by my window screaming at me: what are you doing on the road!!  You shouldn't be driving!!!  I remember thinking: what a weird dream.  And I nodded back off again.I opened my eyes again and I was on the Narrow's bridge, which is about 50km from my last position at the on-ramp.  I was stopped, but my car's front end was mashed into the rear end of the car in front.  Not major damage, but serious enough.  People were surrounding my car absolutely screaming their heads off at me.  And I thought: Hmmm what a weird dream.  And I nodded off again.  Then I woke up in a police car, a little more back to reality, looked around and said 'What the hell am I doing here?'  The police were actually quite friendly and told me everything.  It still felt like a dream, but I was more alert and decided to do a reality check. Owww! I slapped myself and could feel it.  HOLY SHIT!I started to freak.  The police calmed me down, and I explained to them about the sleeping pills and going to bed.  The police thought I was on heroin or acid or something, cause they alcohol tested me and got an almost nill reading.  So they took me to the hospital to have urine and blood tests for drugs.Luckily, I tested negative for drugs (illicit) and negative for benzo's, morphine, and other nasty prescription drugs.  Simply cause all I took was Stilnox.  They didn't have a test for Stilnox, and because the drug was relatively new to Australia, it was not a drug that was illegal to use while driving.  So the police couldn't charge me with anything.Later, I heard I caused quite a little excitement for this small city.  I even made it on the news.  Apparently I had been driving down the highway for 50km (30 miles) going about 5km/h (3mph) in a 100km/h zone (65mph).  I was driving all over the place in all 4 lanes, cars narrowly missing me.  I caused a huge traffic jam (this was during a busy part of the day) and pissed a lot of people off!  If I hadn't rear ended that car, I probably would have kept on going!  The next day I retrieved the car.  The damage wasn't too bad.  But the sides of the car was also dented and scraped.  I must have been bouncing off the guard railings.  About $2000 damage in total to my car, $1500 to the other car.  I have tried a 20mg Ambien dose recently, had hallucinations (pleasant) and really cool lucid dreaming. ‘Twas the eve afore the turning to my 22nd year.  My friends, most of whom my elders, had been anxiously awaiting this day to come, eager to get me intoxicated in public for the first time legally.  Given the adventures of the previous year, it was touching to know I still had people close to me who cared.  By the time I was to turn 21, I had only been a year using illicit substances other than alcohol, and before that I had more straightedge qualities than could be found at the desk of an architect.  By 20, I had grown weary of remaining sheltered from the world and had heard enough good things about marijuana to warrant some exploration in the area.  Within 6-months of trying it, I was a daily smoker.  I had always been a stoner at heart, and even when I was straight, I often had a hard time convincing people that I didn’t smoke pot.  So stonerdom seemed to fit quite well for me.  It changed me in ways both good and bad.  I became infinitely more relaxed and at peace, although it also brought upon me a sloth and laziness I have not yet recovered from.  Despite the torture of idleness, I wouldn’t change anything because I have certainly gotten more out of my use of marijuana than I regret, and it has made me who I am now – something I could never wish changed.  The “yerba buena” has given to me moments of such clarity, such understanding, that I nearly shutter to think about what my life would be like had I not had such visions.They say cannabis is the “gateway drug”.  This is a decision each must make for himself.  Smoking weed certainly is easy because there is no danger of permanent damage.  Depending on your locale, it is comparatively cheap, and not considered a big deal by the general populace.  Although I must admit, “growing-up” on the SoCal bud has thoroughly spoiled me, and I doubt I will ever be happy with less-than-outstanding herb.  To me, it was indeed a bit of a gateway.  It showed me that drugs are not as fearsome and horrific as I was led to believe all my life.  It introduced me to the idea of Instant Nirvana; the idea that one could feel near-perfect merely by the implementation of an outside influence.  It was a new idea to me since I had never even used over-the-counter medications or prescriptions or anything before.So yes, in some ways, marijuana was a gateway for me.  But I will forever maintain that the ganja just let me peek-inside the pandora’s box; I opened the lid myself.There we were at the apartment I was soon to live in, a fair number of people congregated there for no other reason than to get messed up and take “the kid” out for a good time on the town.  I had tried a line or two of cocaine a few months before and didn’t really like how it made my nose and throat numb.  I was told my experience was less than mind-blowing because I took a low dosage, and because I was already baked by the time I did the lines.  Well, this night of my 21st birthday, I had no excuses.  I had decided that it was the one night in my life I didn’t have to be overly-responsible.  The one opportunity I had to get as crazy as I wanted and not worry about it.  I didn’t have to drive, I didn’t have to pay for anything; this was my night.  Enter the coke.We started off with cocktails around 8:00.  I wouldn’t be 21 until midnight, so we had some time to kill before we went out.  A friend of mine had decided to show me a great 21st, and arranged plenty of cocaine for our night – there was more than enough to go around, and being the birthday boy, I got a lion’s share.  We started drinking and doing lines, having a grand old time.  I must have done 8-10 small lines by 11:30 when we realized we should go since bars would be closing in but two hours.  I would have been quite drunk by the time we left, but having exposed my relatively virginal system to so much coke, I felt like a million bucks.  We went down to the local hotspot and cruised from one bar to the next downing drinks like water.  We were very let down that the bars had to close at 2:00am, so decided to keep drinking at the apartment.We came home, opened up a bottle of Stoli, and started doing more coke and drinking more.  We sparked up some joints and proceeded to take intoxication to a whole new level.  Everyone was out the door by 4:00 or 5:00am, and by then I was peaking on the 15-20 lines and as just as many hard-drinks for the night, not to mention the three or four joints.I had experienced the beautiful combination of alcohol and marijuana before, and knew it to take me into new planes of thought, but what I was about to experience made previous breakthroughs seem like the buzz you get from a cigarette.Between about 4:30am to around 8:30, what I went through can barely be described.  I was running around, singing, dancing, feeling like I was God – unbreakable, invincible.  I saw myself in the mirror and had a fascinating discussion with myself.  Verse and rhyme came to me without the necessity to think them up.  The motions of my body were more defined and perfectly nonclumsy than I knew possible.  My hands and body moved quickly and eloquently as my mind.  I was superhuman.  To this day, and forever more I imagine, the experience will be closer to divinity than I knew man could ever attain.  The journey offered me a taste of heaven, allowed me to realize human perfection as I had never conceived.  The lessons and experiences of that night I will carry with me always and shall always serve as a reminder of total perfection.Until I tried to sleep.  There is no way all of the alcohol in my system could possibly have dissipated, but I had so much counter-effect from the cocaine that I was not sick.  I had to be at my parents’ home the next night to celebrate my birthday with my family, so I knew I had to be at least somewhat rested, so I collapsed on the floor and rolled about in half-consciousness until around 2:00 in the afternoon.  I don’t remember when I realized it, but shortly after I regained full awareness, I knew that my body was more trashed than I had expected.  I could barely move; my head pounded like it was being sledge-hammered constantly – this was not a normal hangover.  Every limb and extremity was sore to the extreme.  Eventually I was able to walk around enough to find the excedrin and a glass of water.  The hangover I was feeling was, in contrast to a few hours prior, the closest thing to Hell that I have ever been able to imagine.  I couldn’t think, I couldn’t speak – all I could do is hurt - everywhere.  My throat and nose were clogged with mucous and (little did I realize) coke.  Eventually enough water and eyedrops and sniffling made me feel somewhat back-from-the-dead, but still in horrific pain.  At least gravity now seemed to be only 1.5x the usual sensation.  I realized later that all the sniffling emptied the contents of my nose into my throat, which is actually what caused me to feel alright – I was OK now that the coke was back in my system.  I was able to get a ride to my parents’ house and to convince them that I was simply very hung-over: something most parents would expect on the day after their son’s 21st birthday.  There was truth to this, after all, I had imbibed enough alcohol to bring my body to levels of toxicity it should never be exposed to – and the coke made me feel OK while I was drunk, so I didn’t puke it all up although in the morning I wished I had.  My family bought it and we had a lovely time despite the worse headache I had ever been dished-out.But the story doesn’t end there.  The pieces have continued to fill themselves in as time has gone by: the breakthroughs and realizations I had when I was out of my head did not vanish altogether as I supposed they might.  The morning after the experience, I thought I had lost everything after I came down.  I thought the only way I might ever again achieve these new plateaus of consciousness was by doing the same thing again, but that theory proved itself only true in part.  Admittedly, never since then have I been as totally consumed with the feelings of perfection and supercapacity as that night.  But strangely, there were certain things that had changed in my day-to-day sober life.  The eloquence of movement I had achieved that night began to surface more as I went through normal life: situations I would normally be clumsy about, my body reacted smartly.  When I would make a sharp turn in my car, causing something on the dash to slide, I would be able to catch it from falling while keeping my eyes on the road.  When I am tossed something, I catch it.  I am able now able to groove to music as I had never been able before (alcohol is still sometimes needed to get me in the mood, however).  True, these are things that many take for granted.  Some people have been athletic enough in their life to have practiced catching things – to people as they, what I say may be no big deal.  Lots of people can be completely sober and dance their hearts away.  But I never was like that.  I was never able to catch things in midair, and I couldn’t dance to save my life.  But since then, almost 'The Matrix'-style, I can.I’m not writing this to endorse drugs en masse as a means to propel your psyche, mind, or life.  I have had more good experiences and fewer bad experiences than many can claim, and I like to think that I have enough self-control to know when to use drugs and when not to.  Overall, I think I’m doing well at this, since my only addiction is to marijuana (anybody who tells you its not addictive doesn’t like it that much).  I know that cocaine has opened a door to my mind and soul that shall never be closed, but because of that, I respect the power of the substance more greatly than many.  For me, coke will be only for that special occasion – for the moments when the time is right and my head is in the right place.  I also know now to be careful mixing coke and alcohol, because truth be told, the amount of alcohol I consumed that night was dangerous to my health, and contributed to a somewhat worse-off immune system that I have only recently built back up.But I must also admit that opening this door to my soul also released some demons.  I know what coke can do to me, and sometimes I want it.  Not enough to actually go out and get it, but enough to plague my thoughts every so often.  It opened my mind to other plagues as well: I have less control of what passes through my head now.  Sometimes I can’t get disturbing thoughts out.  If I end up as a psycho-killer, we’ll all know why, but I doubt it will get that bad.  It’s not as though I’ve driven myself nuts yet, but it’s woken me up to the possibility that these drugs may cause some problems.  As an example, (I won’t touch the stuff personally, but to each his own) have you ever met someone what did a lot of acid for a long time – like a hardcore hippy from back in the 60s who would fry twice a day for a 10-year period?  Often people like that are just plain toast in the cranium.In short: temperance.  We have all our life to explore new realms.  Take it easy on your body, mind, and soul, for these are your most valued assets, and let’s be honest: these kinds of drugs do cause negative effects on all of the above.  Take it only so far as you know you can manage.Good luck, fellow psychonauts, and please be careful. So this was my first experience with Lotus, and all in all I was very pleased.On a the first warm Saturday night of 2006, about a week ago, I had several friends over to philosophize and smoke Salvia (1x gravity bong). I am a sort of evangelical when it comes to Salvia, and I try and get others to smoke it at every opportunity. I feel it helps a person tell the truth to himself or herself. Anyway, I had planned on splitting 15 g of Blue Lotus raw leaf with 2 friends as a tea. I boiled the leaf in a tea ball for fifteen minutes and made about 6 tea-cups worth of tea. Once of my friends thought it was ‘not her thing’ after tasting, so really only had one mug. I consumed maybe 3 small tea mugs of lotus and managed to take a good strong dose of Salvia. Me and the afore mentioned girl usually trip very hard on Salvia, and my friend, for whom it was his ‘first time’ also had an unusually powerful salvia trip after about twenty minutes after drinking the lotus. For some reason he couldn’t speak in complete sentences, but uttered words phrases such as “the carped in my old house” and “too many thoughts, so delicious…” when asked. He was almost catatonic and I was really worried that I had launched him into a bad trip, but he would assure me with very short phrases that things were good. He saw “territories of color” and such. He had a good trip, and from what I hear, spectacular visuals for plain Salvia leaf. His girlfriend, who tried the salvia along with him, only got a bit giggly (which is more than pot does for her). I don’t know why so many people get no effect from Salvia raw leaf, but it always makes me sad for them.I had had several tea cups worth of the lotus and a hit of salvia. The tea wasn’t too bitter, and tastes a little like the very expensive Chinese tea wheels that have been fermenting for a while. It isn’t as thick, but if you add a bag of Chinese green tea, it goes down quite naturally. Thirty minutes after taking the tea and two after smoking the salvia, I was getting some nice visual enhancement, though no true hallucinations. I didn’t feel as spiritual as I normally do on salvia, there wasn’t that element of mental struggle and revelation—I just didn’t feel like “doing it.” The tranquilizing effects of the Lotus were wonderful, and it was really quite euphoric. I really wanted my small lady friend to cuddle. I don’t think I could have managed sex if I tried, but I really just wanted to hold someone, to be near another warm person. It made her skin absolutely glow.We decided to smoke some weed (always a good idea when you can barely move). The salvia and lotus were both consumed within an hour of each other, and a good hour later, the marijuana was introduced. The first girl (call her B) and I got really giggly and got most of the ‘pot effects’ without the cotton-headed feeling that normally comes from getting stoned on weed found in the North East. Once the giggles subsided, we kinda just laid down and didn’t say anything for a while. One of us (the guy, call him S) was still mostly catatonic, but seemed happy, his girlfriend holding him and coming down from her salvia trip. They seemed very synchronized in their silence. B and I couldn’t move. From the sternal corpus outward was not quite numb, not quite heavy, but completely without the will to action, and from B’s change in complexion I could tell she was getting something too (didn’t bother to ask). I felt alert, awake, very happy (despite the dawning knowledge that I would get no where with B as I had fantasized), and paid a lot of attention to the Moroccan Flag hanging on the wall opposite me in my room. It was hypnotic. Though at the time, I was well past the window when the salvia’s effects usually wear off, I saw the star, green on a red field, attempting to ‘rotate’ very slowly in place.My roommate comes in and sees us all immobile and decided to bet me $50 that I couldn’t go outside and pick up his Frisbee from a location visible out of my window. I couldn’t take the bet. Honestly I couldn’t do it, though it was less than 300 total feet away. Walking didn’t seem important, neither did money. I wasn’t really ‘happy’ or ‘sad’ or anything so clear, I kinda just “was,” and that can be very nice. It was a pleasant experience free of passion. The experience wasn’t perfect because of the lingering desire for sexuality which doesn’t really go away with any drug I have ever tried accept Mescaline, and the more intense side of Salvia or Mushrooms (then you can’t even reach the idea of sex your so far out of it). Anyway, though Lotus is fairly expensive for an Herbal drug, it gives a wonderful “light, alert-but-tranquil, and all around decent” feeling. Baseline returns after perhaps 4 hours, 11pm-3pm in this case. Somewhere in that whole affair we all managed to drink a little, but not more than a shot or two’s worth of Jagermeister or Vodka for any one person. It probably helped the Lotus too. It was sorta the conversational drinking that college kids do so well. For a normally talkative bunch we were all very mellow.The next day my throat was sore, but that was certainly from the pot and salvia and had nothing to do with the lotus. I had pains in my left supraspinatus muscle, trapezius, and general scapula area, but that likely came from propping in a weird position for forty minutes or so when I didn’t care to move. Be safe friends, and someday reason will prevail. During mid-February, I finally got the opportunity to drink. I had been smoking pot for about a year since then, and had always been curious about its liquid competitor. I know a lot of people who say drinking is very fun, but I could never seem to get anyone who could buy it for me. I was frustrated, but my sister K and her boyfriend B got some liquor, and invited me over for an evening of 'blasting.' I was excited for the event, and planned to have a great time.Friday night, at 10:30, it began. After a few long hours of waiting for K and B to run seemingly countless errands, we began to drink. I started off with a beer. I drank it rather quickly, enjoying the flavor at first, but eventually coming to detest it by the time the bottle was reaching it's end. I polished it off, and then proceeded to the gallon of vodka in the kitchen. I mixed a medium-sized glass of 1/3 vodka and 2/3 cranberry juice together, and went back to the living room. We put on a DVD and I began to feel a bit like I had a headache as the glass disappeared. I got more and more drunk with the minute. We all played a drinking game B called 'Asshole' as the movie played. I don't exactly remember the rules, and frankly, I'm surprised I could even manage to play it with all of the liquor in my stomach. I laughed at the TV, enjoying the humor. In the game, B had just won, and made a rule for the next round which basically said that whenever I drank, I first had to stand up, spin in a circle, and say, 'Boom-shaka-lacka-lacka.' I began finding this task to be increasingly difficult with each turn. I eventually just ended up spinning halfway around and mumbling 'Boom-shackaaaaaaaaaaaaaa...' and then shoving the rim of my glass to my lips. I didn't like this rule, but was having too good of a time to let it bother me.    I had about seven glasses of the rather disgusting mixture of cranberry juice and vodka. I still don't know why this is such a popular mix, to me, it just tastes like fruit and rubbing alcohol. I ate a microwave burrito, and then some ice cream, enjoying the flavor. I poured one more glass of only vodka, which was probably a mistake, and I then asked B if I could borrow some of his batteries so I could listen to my portable CD player. He told me his batteries were out in his car, so I stumbled my way out to the car and grabbed them. I laid back down on the couch and put on some music as K and B watched another movie. I closed my eyes for quite some time, and when I finally opened them again, B and K were gone from the living room, and the lights were off. I was confused, but let it pass, and closed my eyes again.     All the fun I had that night was about to go down the toilet. Literally. As the music played on, I began to have a feeling reminiscent to that of going down the drop on a roller coaster. I was enjoying it at first, but gradually, that pleasant feeling began creating nausea in my stomach. I was feeling more and more sick with each passing second, and began to feel horrible. I stumbled my way to the bathroom, and the whole way I didn't feel my feet touching the floor. It was as if I was hovering above the ground. I vomited several times, and then went back to the couch.    Two minutes later, I found myself back in the bathroom, doing the same thing. I was feeling like hell had came into my stomach, and the only thing I could do was to sit and wait. I puked countless times, and was drifting back and forth between the bathroom and the couch for approximately two hours. Somewhere towards the end, B woke up and came out in the living room. He got a glass of warm water, added just a small bit of salt, and told me to drink it, saying the salt would absorb some of the alcohol and the water would help it pass through, or something like that. I don't exactly remember, but I drank it. Water was running all over my face due to my lack of coordination. I vomited one final time, and came back to the couch.    I don't remember falling asleep, but rather, I seemed to just seamlessly transition into a dreaming state. I had strange, vivid dreams. I saw the darkened night sky, and in the center, there was a giant star with black eyes, spinning slowly. It was incredibly peaceful and beautiful, and I marveled.   The next day, my stomach felt unsettled. I didn't have the trademark pounding headache or lack of energy that marks a typical hangover, but my stomach felt as though it couldn't handle much of anything. I'm a pretty regular smoker, but oddly, I had absolutely no desire for a cigarette whatsoever. I went home a few hours after waking up. B gave me some milk, which helped to coat my stomach and mask the nausea I was still feeling for a short time. I drank milk repeatedly throughout the day.     All in all, I don't like drinking. The buzz, although somewhat satisfying, is a disappointment to me. All I really got out of it was being disoriented and stupider, which is about the exact opposite of what I like a psychoactive experience to be. I'm more for mushrooms and pot, but not alcohol. I've been told that everyone's first experience is horrible, so I have to wonder why so many people do it. I simply don't want to go through the misery of that experience again to develop enough of a tolerance to only get the primary effects, which I don't even care for. I learned that night that I do not want to drink another drop in my life. I hate alcohol. The day started out like many other summer days -- a couple of friends and I decided to get drunk. (M, B, & myself. We also had a sober friend, J) The best way to do that, in our opinion, was to split a 750ml bottle of 151 proof rum. So, we took a trip to our favorite local not-by-the-book liquor store and bought our goods. About $21 dollars later, we had a large bottle of Bacardi in our bag and anticipation in our hearts. Since we're fairly new at this drinking thing (read: pussy little bastards), or at least B and M are, we needed chasers. I feel that Gatorade is the best sort of chaser. The taste is also bearable, for me, when mixed with such a high proof alcohol. Yet another benefit of drinking from a Gatorade bottle is that of its inconspicuous nature. For me, it has worked every time, knock on wood. We also each brought a liter of water and some mouthwash for afterwards. Parents, parents, parents.        So, we get to this park that is quite infamous for drinking, smoking and that sort of thing. We drink off about one-third of the Gatorade bottle and refill it with the rum. (There were approximately 7 or 8 ounces of rum in the Gatorade ‘’cocktail‘’.) The 750ml bottle of Bacardi 151 comes with a little pourer cap, so not a lot of it comes out at one time. This is probably good in bars, when all people need to pour is about a shot at a time. Maybe we should have taken this as a hint, I don’t know. Since we needed some motivation, we played Shot-Blackjack, in which the losers have to drink a shot of their Gatorade-Bacardi mixture. As we got happier, Blackjack became boring and we became obnoxious, I suppose, since our sober friend was getting annoyed. (On second thought, she is perpetually annoyed, so I can’t be too sure how obnoxious we were.) M mentions that drinking his concoction is like drinking water, while B can hardly choke it down. I’m quite indifferent as I have a bit more experience. (Not necessarily a good thing.) Sitting around while drunk is nowhere near as fun as walking around while drunk, so we had to find something to do. I had to pick up some food for my dad, so that’s what we did first. Admittedly, it’s not the most fun thing, but it was something. J (the sober friend) and I bring the food to my house, while M and B wait outside and continue to drink. When J and I come back out, M is a lot drunker than B. He’s also a skinny bastard, while B is not. I was slightly buzzed at that point, since I had to slow down drinking to not look so bad in front of my dad. M was really wasted at this point, as I remember laughing really loudly at him and slapping my knees, and I was just trying to catch up, since being only slightly buzzed but having to hang around drunk bastards is a waste of $7 bucks. B was stumbling around and babbling something about Clay Aiken. J was just plain embarrassed (and maybe a little pissed, being sober.) We stood around near my building for a while, trying to decide what to do next. J wanted to go downtown to get Japanese food, so that’s what we agreed to do. (Although, it probably wasn’t the best idea, since I need a pretty strong stomach in general to eat Japanese food, and the liquor was not helping any in that department. But I like Japanese food, so I guess it wouldn‘t have been that big of a problem.) To get downtown, we have to take the subway. I’ve been on the subway while drunk, and it’s a bumpy ride that isn’t too good on the stomach. (Malt liquor + hot dogs + long, bumpy subway ride = sure way to get myself to puke in public.) The walk from my house to the subway is about 7 blocks, but we first had to go to J’s house for her to get money from her Grandmother. M, B and I wait outside. By this point, all three of us have finished our Gatorade cocktails, so M and I go to the store to get another chaser. I’m not sure if they were out of Gatorade or if I just couldn’t find it, so I ended up getting some sort of Cranberry juice bottle. M gets nothing because he’s hella wasted and is lying down on the floor and wants to take a nap in the store. I had to get him up to go to the counter and pay for the juice, which I did. I remember the guy at the counter telling me the juice was $1.25, as opposed to the dollar I am used to paying, so I angrily mumble something about him ripping me off. Lord only knows what he thought. So M, J, B and I make our way to the subway. B is up ahead with J talking about god knows what, while I’m acting like a crutch for M because he can hardly walk. He trips, I trip, and we fall in a dried up pile of dog crap. (Gotta love the New York City streets.) Some people were passing, they almost trip over us, laugh and continue walking. I figure that M is going to need some rest, so I get him up and get him to lie uncomfortably on someone else’s car, while hoping the owner isn’t around to call the cops. B and J disappear somewhere for nearly 10 minutes, and M and I are just hanging there. Now, not being in the best state, I make a few choices that could have turned out not so good. I have my new Oceanspray cranberry juice chaser, pour half of it out, and replace it with more rum. I start drinking, while slapping M intermittently to make sure he’s still alive. I also give him some water to drink so he has something more to puke up. B shows up out of nowhere without our sober buddy. Looking back, this is probably the point where we become royally screwed. Passersby are staring and inquiring about our mental state, a cop car slows down and stares at us but thankfully, this being the ghetto, continues going, as a few drunk-off-their-ass teenagers are the least of their worries. (Another reason to love New York City.B and I, being the least fucked up, decide to try and get M somewhere where he can just wait out the alcohol. This little baseball field was our choice, as it was big enough for us to lie around in without being suspicious. We make it across the street and maybe 10 feet up, but then sort of collapse in front of this Jehovah Witnesses church building parking lot. M and I sat there for about 20 minutes, although it could have been 20 seconds and I wouldn’t have known the difference. At this point, M starts puking. On my pants, on his pants, in the church’s plants. B says something about pissing and disappears for a few minutes. He comes back, and I go piss behind someone’s car. I have to be pretty fucked up to piss in public, so I guess I was. B starts to take some pictures, and lord only knows what he got. People who are passing by are staring, M gets up to go piss or something, doesn’t make it, and lies down in the middle of the street. This is where I started to get panicked. People are always going to go and do something when there’s a semi-conscious body in the middle of a NYC street. So, I’m assuming, someone calls the cops. A crowd forms. B convinces me to go to the corner and pretend we don’t know him, to avoid getting in trouble. One cop car shows up, and somehow multiplies into 6 and an ambulance. The cops were quite jovial, getting a kick out of the drunken teenager. M says his name is Ernie Ichijogi, which is quite far from his real name. He also starts flipping off the cops, which I found quite hilarious. Since we were sure M was going to get taken care of, B and I started to leave. Then, somehow, M’s mom drops from the sky and appears, running towards M, who is now in an ambulance. She stops me, asks me what is happening, and all that fun stuff. Being quite drunk, but not nearly as drunk as M, I get quite scared and think that M has alcohol poisoning and is going to die or get permanent brain damage, or something equally as terrible. I start bawling, and asking her if he’s okay. She says no, so I cry even harder. The walk home was terrible, since I was bawling and people were asking if I was okay. I dumped the rest of the Bacardi, and called J on her cell phone, still bawling. She actually made it downtown and got Japanese food, I found out soon after. So M’s mom is angry at me, thinking I forced him to drink and B said I gave them the liquor. People do maddening things when they want to cover their ass, so I don’t hold any grudges, but it’s still annoying to know that he totally sold me out when we all made the consensual decision to drink. Later, I found out that M was taken to the hospital and they found he had a Blood Alcohol Concentration of .216 or so, which is indeed very high, but not especially lethal. M had never had such an intense reaction to alcohol and has drank way more than the 8 or so ounces he drank that day, but he also hadn’t slept or eaten for two days. For that, he spent a night in the hospital and has a pretty funny story to tell.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I’m a fairly normal guy in my thirties, with a steady job, and no medical history, but it could be said I have an addictive personality.  At the time of this alcohol experience, I was in the middle of losing a serious relationship, and I was stressed from some financial issues as well.  In addition, I/we were drinking five or more drinks daily, and as I had recently finished building a bar in our home, there was a large quantity of alcohol readily available.  Around 10 am on a Saturday, my girlfriend went off to work, and I promptly made my first Long Island tea of the day.  I had maybe nine of these on an empty stomach, and a few beers as well.  If I ate anything at all, it was a small bag of chips and some nuts.    I’m content being alone, so it surprises me that I decided to head out for some company.  I made it to one of my haunts—a pool hall maybe 5 miles away and was delighted to see Bill, with whom I was once very close, but hadn’t seen in a few years.  I even hugged the guy (which is unlike me), and we enjoyed beers and shots of tequila, and caught-up on each others’ lives.  Being Saturday afternoon, people I knew kept showing up and I kept buying shots of tequila and drinking beer.  I was high for a few hours, but eventually, I got sloppy, and was apparently asked to leave.  I was blacking in and out by then, and vaguely remember some sort of altercation with a bouncer (which is also unlike me).  As we headed to the parking lot, this guy decided I wasn’t driving anywhere, and I did not protest as he took my keys.  I was laid out across the back seat of his ancient Suburban, and there was a second passenger sitting next to the driver.     Before we move on to the weird part, let me make a few statements: 1) I live not far from where the alien spaceship crashed in 1947, and “I believe”.  2) As mentioned above, my mental state was clouded with money and girl issues, and I was possibly not far from some sort of “mental episode” anyway.   3) The interior lighting in the old truck was sub-standard.  4) I had been drinking significant quantities all day on an empty stomach.As we hit a pothole, I was shaken back to consciousness.  This is what I assessed—I know where I am and whom I’m with, but we should not be driving on a dirt road.  From this angle, and with the lighting, Bill looks like some sort of alien.  Oh Christ, Bill is an alien, so is that other guy, and they’re taking me out to the desert and bad things will happen there. It is imperative that I get away from these aliens right away!  My plan was this—get them to pull over, lure them from the vehicle, then run back to the vehicle, and drive away fast. Therefore, I did.At this point, the paranoia got much worse, and now it wasn’t just Bill and his friend that were aliens, but the whole city was being taken over.  Then, I lost hold of the alien concept and was simply fleeing from some “evil thing”.  I recall screaming aloud over and over, WHAT THE FUCK IS GOING ON? The only solution was to get out of town.  It seemed a noble idea to rescue my girlfriend too, so I headed towards home driving insanely the whole way.  When I got there, she had just recently got off the phone with some guy named Bill who related a ridiculous story about being stranded on a dirt road by a screaming lunatic, so she had gone to give him a ride and try to fill in the details.  “Well, I can’t wait for her,” I thought, so I headed towards the edge of town.  Being the rational person that I am, I knew I would need supplies for this journey, so walked into a gas station, grabbed a 12 pack of Corona, 2 bottles of water, and left.  The cashier tried to stop me, but I screamed something about how it was pointless to pay when this evil thing was going to wipe out the town anyway.  She promptly called the police.  The vehicle I was driving was huge and white, and since it was swerving all over the road, I promptly had flashers and sirens behind me.  As I failed to pull over, I soon had three or so cop cars trailing me, and in my desperation, we were soon all doing 70 mph through town.  I was not running from the cops because I didn’t want to be arrested; It was because I knew they were “in on it”, and I really didn’t want to experience an alien anal probe, or whatever else they had in mind. Eventually, I totaled the vehicle, rolling it 3 times but as I was wearing a seatbelt, and someone was watching over me, I was only cut up a little bit.  At the hospital, I became obsessed with the idea that someone must have spiked one of my drinks, and insisted they check my blood and piss for drugs.  I was clean except for a BAC of .28 or something.  Apparently, a “Mickey” wouldn’t show-up anyway, but I’ve accepted the idea that I was just too drunk, and a little stressed.  When I related this horror story at drug and alcohol counseling, one of the ex-cons remarked, “Well, it sounds like you acted correctly if you really thought that’s what was going on.”  After spending a few thousand, I got out of jail, and embraced sobriety.  It’s been a couple years now, and I’m pretty sure Bill isn’t really an alien.  However, when Star Trek comes on TV, I tend to change the channel; it makes me feel a little anxious. The first time I tried alcohol, I was a bit nervous about its effects (having heard all the hangover stories). I was browsing online one night feeling a bit bored, looking for a lift in my mood. I had tried wine before, but it did almost nothing to me- what's more, it also tasted horrible. Around 10:30pm I took about 4 sips of some generic chardonnay. but I was up for something a little stronger, so I decided to try some hard liquor.At about 11:00pm, I happened to find some 80 proof Vodka under the kitchen sink and decided to give it a go. I was shocked to find that it was a crystal clear liquid, like water (don't laugh, remember I'd never seen it before.). I poured about 1/8 cup into a small glass as its strong antiseptic smell stung my nose. I managed to down the stuff in three gulps; it tasted so horrible I could barely keep myself from gagging. It tasted like I had swallowed a bottle of rubbing alcohol.I was surprised to feel the back of my throat burning and numbing, as if I had just gargled listerine. It produced a warm, burning sensation down the center of my chest, not necessarily pleasurable but not unpleasant either. I became aware of the drug working after only a few minutes; the tips of my fingers tingled and felt a bit numb, and I felt heavier somehow- slow and sedated into my chair. Everything seemed sort of calm and peaceful, very happy and wonderful. I also felt what I later described as a kind of 'delayed reaction'- my body would move, and then my brain would have to 'catch up' with what I was doing. Feeling this, I quickly realized why it was so dangerous to drink and drive- my muscle coordination had decreased quite a bit; I felt lazy and relaxed. At about 11:30pm, I figured I could go for a bit more. This time I pulled out a bottle of tequila and poured the same 1/8 cup dose into a small glass, and managed to down it in two gulps. Another half hour after this, I began to experience some typical 'drunk' symptoms; random things seemed unusually funny, I tilted a bit (though not much) when walking to the bathroom, and I even fell into a temporary period where I wasn't quite sure of what had happened. I recall doing something on my computer, and I suddenly realized that there were random popup messages there and add-on sidebars that I hadn't even noticed! How on earth they got there, and for how long they'd been there, I couldn't remember at all. But for the most part, it was quite fun. I felt a sense of inner well-being and had almost no cares in the world. Everything was warm and comfortable, a mild high.Finally, after deciding I should get some sleep, I stumbled in a happy dream-like state to the bathroom at 2:00am, where I took a bath and prepared for bed. I fell heavily onto the bed, almost as if weights forced me down onto the mattress. I felt a slight vertigo- things around me were spinning, and it was actually pleasurable- I was not nauseated. I woke up several hours later at 8am feeling intense thrist; I drank several gulps from a water bottle and went back to bed until around noon. The next day I still felt a bit sedated but not significantly impared, and I was relieved to find that I didn't experience a hangover.Overall, I'd say it was a fairly good experience. I got some Diet pills in the states that contained Ephedrine awhile back.  I had taken them every once in awhile to get me going and have had no problem.  I have also have had nothing really bad with drinking.  The odd puking but nothing serious.Anyways I guess I have been pretty stressed in the weeks before my experience which might of had an impact.  I got to my friends house where everyone was going to be drinking.  I was working the next day and was extremely tired.  I originally decided not to drink but started to feel semi depressed and felt I was being a downer for everyone.  So out of nowhere I decide to have fun.  So I down 2 of my diet pills with some 43% dry gin. From then on I keep the drinks coming.  At this point I would say I was having a good time at this point.  I was really hyper and really drunk.  I ran outside for no reason and did dumb stuff.  When I come back I drink some more.  Now I start to calm down but I'm never tired.  In the basement my best friend was with his girlfriend and my other friend was with this girl and a girl I was interested in.  She was totally ignoring me. At this point I became extremely depressed.  The most depressed I have ever been.  I go upstairs and write fucked up shit in a journal. Then I proceed to start lightly cutting myself on the arm with a knife. I felt so bad. Then I go back downstairs to try to cheer up. There no one talks to me or even acknowledges my presence.  In my head I was SURE they hated me. That they were all against me somehow. Now start to really freak. In my head its an avanlanche of bad thoughts and depressing things.  Then I decide to down another drink pick up my things and go. I was supposed to sleep over but left without telling anybody. On the way home I started sobbing and sat in the middle of the road. Then I got up and started try to walk home.  I think I started blacking out. I have many jumps of memory and conciousness. I went down many wrong roads and eventually got home. Inside I barely remember anything but I remember listening to music and wanting to kill myself.  Then the next I remember is being on the bathroom floor in the dark.  There I try to sleep cause I was working the next morning.  However I think the ephedrine is still working and I have insomnia and I was sweating I think.  I think I finally got like 45 minutes of sleep but my mom woke me up.  When I woke got up I noticed that my hand was covered in blood.  My knuckles were all ripped.  I have no idea how they got there.  As for my arm I didnt draw blood with the knife(it was bluntish) but I did have marks.  Anyways I just want to say this was the worst experience of my life. I felt so depressed and cried.  I hurt myself and scared my friends.  I really tripped out.  I never want this to happen again.  I'm not sure if it was the ephedrine or the alcohol but all I know is that I am never mixing the 2 again.  I will also try to drink in better mental states as well.  I wouldn't wish these feelings and experiences on my worst ennemy. This year was my junior year in high school, and I got sick of the blandness of everything and decided to try as many drugs as I could get my hands on. Coming from a tiny town, there wasn't much available, and at my boarding school (which has an incredibly harsh drug/alcohol policy) it's hard to get my hands on Motrin, let alone any recreational drugs.I took Ritalin/Adderall and other similar medications from second grade through ninth, and thus had a high tolerance towards stimulants. As is the case with many students, I started taking caffeine pills not for the drug value but to stay up late. However, I found that they made me both happy and alert (I had been having issues with depression as well as sleep deprivation) so, having discovered a gold mine, I indulged in quite a few Vivarin a day.At some point I started snorting it, which usually did nothing for me other than sting my nose, but occasionally if I inhaled enough and sharply enough, it would leave me with a pleasant feeling of high energy, happiness, and a little shaking for about a half hour.By the time December rolled around, I was taking four pills at a time, and on the mornings when I forgot to grab them, my concentration and my vision would waver in class, and I would 'zone out' and be quite irritable. A friend of mine became 'concerned' and took my box of Vivarin from me; however, a weekend trip to New York procurred not only more but also a bottle of Vodka.This is where the fun begins; suffering from withdrawel, I popped in five pills at once, and within 45 minutes we (my friends and I) were back in the dorm and drinking our bottle. I don't get a chance to drink all that often, so I more or less hogged the bottle and drank very quickly. I mistakenly thought I could handle a lot, having gauged my tolerance for beer that summer over a couple of JDs; however, I was wrong, and pretty soon (half an hour)was completely drunk. I had two more pills in the process of getting drunk, and soon my entire body was numb. There were an amount of people in the room, and we were all drunk and we all acted it as well; however, I was notably the only one who was trembling on and off. It was an odd feeling, because between the numbness and the shaking my entire body just felt like it was made out of strings, and someone was giving them a bunch of good tugs. My mind was in a fairly odd state at the time; asides from the usual symptoms of drunkeness, everything just seemed to be speeding by incredibly quickly. One of my sober friends walked me to my room, trying to keep any dorm staff from noticing- they didn't thank goodness. She made me take a shower and go into bed; at this point, my occasional trembling had changed to all out uncontrollable shaking (1 more pill was taken in my room, after) and I was told to lie down and sleep everything off.Oddly enough, it was easy to fall asleep but I woke up an hour later, as curious dorm inhabitant came to my room to play games with my mind. After telling them to fuck off, I noticed that I was still shaking, my hands particularly but my entire body as well. My mind couldn't stay on one subject for any amount of time, and I simply lay in my bed for about four hours, just shaking, until I eventually fell asleep from exhaustion.I woke up the next morning, and I had the occasional tremble back. I was moody, etc, but I had managed through the whole thing without either vomitting or acquiring much of a headache, so I felt some pride. Of course, I was tired, so more caffeine pills. I spent much of the day dizzy and lost, and I couldn't concentrate on anything, so I paid for my behavior.It was incredibly unpleasant to be concious through four hours of shaking, and I was truly afraid that it wouldn't stop; though oddly enough I never panicked. Well I have always wanted to try mind altering substance for a while now.  As sports in my school are coming up, smoking is out of the question (And I don't mean cigarettes)  Basically my two best friends Z and X wanted to get drunk.  So we pitched in some money, and got our hookup to grab the booze.  All that I really wanted was Peppermint Shnapps 100 proof because I love peppermint, and I wasn't really down for a shitty tasting beverage, or guzzling a bunch of beers, and being really full.  Anyway that night was a quiet night, and I just was hanging out with my sibling, and his friend.  I was quite bored so I decided to try some of the stuff myself.  I grabbed a water bottle and poured a tiny amount of the Shnapps in and downed it (Damn it smelled great, and for the most part going down it was smooth)  Now I couldn't really feel anything so in a little while I did this again except with about a shotful in the bottle, and then diluted it with some water from another bottle.  After this I felt it a little, but I soon wanted more of a drunken stupor feeling.  Hell when the parents are asleep, and I wasn't doing anything on a friday why not?  Anyway a little while after that it started to kick in, and I felt relaxed, and extremely comfortable.  It was a pretty good feeling, but I wanted it to be stronger so I took another shot in like 20 minutes.  That strengthened the effect it had on me, and I was having a very good time just sitting on the couch and watching T.V. with my aquantinces.  They didn't have a clue that I was in the process of getting plastered (That is a good thing, as generally the younger population is feed anti-drug/alcohol shit to pollute their brain.  I didn't want to take a chance that my siblings friend would be a loudmouth and have something slip out as he is VERY loud) Anyway I could walk pretty good, but was starting to feel a little bit tipsy which was an awesome feeling.  It's not the normal kind of dizzying effect that I get when sick, or if I hit in the head.  I was trying to walk in a straight line, and couldn't really do it, but I could come pretty close.  After the next 'shot' my head started to feel pretty heavy.  I announced that 'My head feels like lead, but not lead, because I like mercury better.'  Now it was getting really fun, and I even fell over like twice, but was easily able to get myself back up.  I said to myself that I should take one last shot, and that would be it.  Soon I was performing the water bottle pouring ritual, and then diluting it with water from another bottle.  This time I believe I took more than one shot worth, but it is hard to tell.  After this I felt very happy, and sedated.  It wasn't like a dreamlike state, and I felt I was all there.  I explained the feeling to my sibling that my mind was working fine, but what came out of it was a mixture of raw thoughts, and unrefined speach that sounded not natural, but funny as hell!  Soon they started laughing at me falling over, and I was laughing at myself.  It was very enjoyable, but now I didn't want to walk around too much becuase it was very late at night, and I just wanted to go to sleep, and say goodnight to my sibling and his friend.  Normally I am an aggressive person, but drinking kind of brings out the opposite in me.  Whilst drunk, and stumbling around I found myself very happy, and therefore I was nice to my sibling and his friend.  I was more nice than usual, and was even clearing up their stuff on the ground because I didn't want them to get in trouble for being pigs in the morning.  I have a decent memory of what happened, but some parts of the night are a little bit hazy.  So overall I felt that this experiance was absoultly fantastic, and has opened my mind up to using this substance more often.  By the way this was my first time really drinking, and I am extremely happy that I can get pretty much cocked off my ass on like 3 shots.  I would expect if I did 2 more shots I probably would literally be on my ass, and it might not be as fun as it was.  Half the fun was stumbling around, just trying to operate normally without stumbling.  I remember laughing a LOT, and making jokes as I usually do.  Generally I was more quite, relaxed, and happy than I normally am.  Also to be noted is the slight numbing effect that alcohol has on the skin.  I wouldn't describe it as 'numbing' but it feels just different, but of course as everything in my first experiance with alcohol, in a good way. Normal Saturday night right before my graduation from high school.  My and my buddies went to a party of another friend of mine that I have known for sometime.  We started drinking about 6pm that night and I was well drunk by this time.    My best friend and I are looking for a ride home as the party starts to die down.  I call my girl-cousin who's my good friend to come and pick me and my best friend up.  Of course she does, she came and got me and my best friend but I forgot to inform her that my sister and my best friend's girlfriend was with us.  Turns out she didn't have enough room in her car to take us 4, so she takes my best friend and he goes to my house to get his car and come pick up his girlfriend, my sister and I.  We get to my house and it's about 2 30am.  My sister had just hurt her shoulder from the weekend and she was perscribed hydro's and muscle relaxor's.  Anxious because I hadn't taken hydro's in some time she said she would give me some to get a buzz and fall asleep that night.  Turns out we get home and my mom had hide my sister's hydro's from her cause she knew she was no longer in pain.  Discourged I headed upstairs to grab another beer, when I see my mom's perscription to Paroxetine. From my previous drug addict state that I had for two years, but I had been completely sober for over a year now.  Yes I quit cold turkey no rehad or medication from the likes of shrooms, acid, pills and most of all weed.  I quit cause I realized the bad reputation I was getting around town, and I was a A, B student and an athlete of my school.Anyway, I see the perscription and being drunk and stupid I figure what the hell.  I took 3 pills thinking this will do the trick.  I head downstairs to watch Requim for a Dream, it's by far the most hardcore movie I've ever seen about drug addicts.   Anyway last thhing I remember, I'm becoming very drozy, and pass out. I wake up to this terrible feeling in my stomach, and I'm no longer in my bed, I'm on my couch in the upstairs living room, no worried about how the fuck I got there I head for the bathroom downstairs.  I look at the clock and its 5 30 am.I make it to the bathroom and throw up violently for a minute or 2. My vomit wasn't food but brown chucks of ball-like substances.  I think man, I'm fucked up this blows.  Not thinking too much of it cause I've been really fucked up before in my years of doing drugs, I drink a bottle of water and head to my bed.  I remember not being able to sleep for what seemed ages.  I have chills but I'm burning up and down.  My friend is sleeping right next to me so I can't roll around in my bed and have my own space, worse feeling ever.  My friend wakes me up before like he always does and just hangs out in my room playing x box and other shit.  I remember I sleep for periods of about 20 mins. and have fucked up dreams and wake up kicking and reaching for objects that aren't really there.  My friend leaves about noon, and I tell him to call me to play ball later.  I'm still fucked up but I figure I'm just really tired and will sleep it off in the next few hours.  For the next 12 hours I didn't leave my bed, just tossing and turning and having fucked up dreams.  My mom is getting pissed because I won't get out of bed for Sunday dinner.  I had no appetite at all that day, and didn't eat one thing. I didn't even drink anything.  I recall getting up to go to the bathroom and I could barely walk.  Nightime finally comes and its about 10pm.  I'm pissed because this hell won't wear off and I have my last week of high school ever, and i'm gonna be sick as fuck to take my finals on tuesday and wednesday, worse of all I just got a new job and I'm gonna suffer 3hrs after school until this shit wears off.  I go to sleep, hoping this shit will wear off by the morning....  I wake up at 4 30 its still dark out and I get up to go to the bathroom, of course this Paxil shit hadn't wore off and I can barely walk with no strength at all.  I look in the mirror and my pupils are the size of dimes.  I'm just thinking thinking what a fucking perfect time to be fucked up on drugs the last week of my high school career.  I wake up at 6 am to my mom and sister getting ready for the day.  I see I still have 2 hrs to sleep before I have to get up for school.  My alarm goes off.... I get in the shower and am still as fucked up as the day before.  I think I'm living a nightmare and this shit will never wear off.  I start to get dressed and think I can make it through school and work and come home right away and sleep.    Who am i kidding, I've been fucked up before at school but this would be impossible to try and get through.  I call my mom and tell her to call the school and say i'm not coming in.  She concered asking me if I've taken any drugs, because I never miss school ever.  I hate making up work and I always go if I'm remotely sick.  I lie and tell her no.  A sense of relief comes over me and I think awesome I getta sleep the day away.  I think to myself and remember from my past drug days that a drug doesn't stimuli forever adn the reason it is is because I have nothing in my system.  I go upstairs about 8 30am and have a donut and a glass of milk and head for bed.  I start feeling better but still fucked up.  My moms calls and says its okay i missed school but I can't miss my new job. I agree.  Around noon I wake up and realize I can't sleep anymore and I have 3hrs before I have to be to work.  I manage to eat a bowl of ceral and choke down 3 big glasses of water.  I look in the mirror and still look like shit.  Pupils still very much dialated. 245pm rolls around and i have to be to work.  I force myself to get dressed and go to work. Luckily the sun was bright as shit and my pupils strunk by the time I got to work.  I was fatigued as fuck at work and managed to get through it.  I got home and made 2 bomb cheeseburgers, and for the first time in over 24 hrs I feel sober.  It is now monday night around 1 am. And I can't sleep the well cause I did so much so in the past 36hrs.  I learned my lesson that I gave up drugs a year ago for instances like this.    I couldn't sleep so I got online and I read so of the experiences on Paxil and found other people have had the same experiences that I had in the past 48 hrs.  I was stupid for doing what I did. This is not an account of any one time encounter with drinking; it is what I can recall of letting myself go over the edge with a substance.Before my junior year of high school all I knew about alcohol was that I had a good tolerance to it; I could handle a lot more than some adults I knew without getting any real effects.  I was 17 at the time and having recently discovered how great pot was I was just open to anything that made me feel high.  The first few times I tried drinking it was just awesome; a lot like being really stoned but much more overwhelming and with a real strong euphoria.  I never got any negative effects like hangovers, and I never puked at all back in those days.  At one point I got a bottle of Everclear and kept that in my house for rare occasions; I could mix a shot or two of it with some sort of juice, smoke a bowl, and expect a great night.  At this time it was such an uncommon experience for me that every time was the same great drunk feeling.  When school let out and summer started is when I really got into it though.  Up until this point I got drunk in some way, but it was more like being very 'sociably drunk'; I had never actually experienced the full blown intoxication stage.  During my birthday was my first chance at this.  A friend of mine came over with a fifth of whiskey; this we mixed with lemonade (with a sour-mash whiskey it is just delicious) and watched Natural Born Killers, to this day one of my all time favorites.  Midway through the movie I really felt it hit: it was like an intense head rush and I felt completely liquid, when I tried to stand up to piss I walked/jogged in a fast, half-stumbling gate, I would look at myself in the mirror and laugh at my reflection telling it how drunk it was.  At the end of the movie I was just fucked and must have blacked out; my friend says I told him I was going upstairs to get some blankets but I never came back, he found me passed out still in my clothes in the morning.  That liquid feeling was the best thing I'd ever felt, and I got it again a few weeks later at a party.  I hit a keg like 6 or 7 times and had some whiskey in the course of two hours or so, and then went back to a friends house to smoke and take some shots (probably 5 or 6).  He was still sober enough so he drove me back home afterward.  By the time I got home I was wasted: I was trying to watch a movie and drink some more (don't know why) and I had spinning double vision; I felt dizzy trying to keep up with the movie and turned it off, but then after sitting in the dark for five minutes I forgot why and turned it back on, this ended in my puking from apparently induced motion sickness.  After those experiences the peak effects of alcohol slowly declined into nothing over the next few months.  I loved drinking so much I started doing it every weekend and actually got bored with pot because it wasn't as strong; I realized how cheap 40's are and this became my number one suggestion of what to do with the day, with two bucks I was good.  I soon amassed enough whiskey in my room to sustain me getting drunk alone every night if I wanted, and this I did.  My dose was half a bottle, mixed with soda, lemonade, or something along those lines.  Up until this point the only sort of hangover I got felt a lot like being high or just still drunk but less so, thus I would smoke a bowl in the morning to come back up and have a good (albeit slow) day.  Soon this turned into my mom buying me 40's when school started back up; I would just drink during the weekends, every saturday night.  A few times I got curious and decided to get more beer than usual so I'd get really wasted; more than two 80 ounces of malt liquor is a bad idea just so you know.  I did some awefully stupid stuff when I got that trashed, a lot of it is just too ridiculous to waste more space here on.  The last time I ever tried it was the worst I've ever been: I can very vaguely recall returning from the bathroom and falling over the back of the couch making a huge crash which woke everyone up, but not really seeming to attach any significance to it, my mom said she came down several times that night and I was passed out somewhere, a couple times I was unrousable for a few minutes.  I did fall on my face in front of her when I was finally headed for bed, for most of the night I had been only half conscious, but somehow I had woken up a bit since then and was now very aware of my extreme state, thus this was pretty damn sad.  After that is when I realized I wasn't enjoying the hangovers as a free high anymore, they were really gross now and I just got a bad headache.  The drunk part itself had all became mundane just like pot had after I abused it; the experience itself is always the same, it's still pleasurable, but nothing is ever knew and exciting about it.  Now I won't let myself get too drunk because I just get every debilitating effect possible from it, and at some point puke my guts out; I have to chug water to rehydrate and ward off hangovers which results in being bloated for a while, and I wake up still feeling fuzzy and out-of-it.  Many people debate hotly with me when I say I was an alcoholic for a while; they claim you can't be an addict for a little while and just snap out of it, especially because I still drink from time to time now.  I know for myself I was at that point though; I couldn't go one day without getting some juice in my body, I even had a friend over once who wouldn't drink and just sat around while I got drunk all night becuase I needed it.  I never binged too heavily or too long so I never got tremors or anything, but I was certainly an addict.  Alcohol to me now is a lot like pot except still much stronger and more overwhelming, it also is much more inebriating.  When I drink now I do it smart, that way I don't end up doing something stupid. Having newly discovered Salvia from my local head shop and had a couple of strange but fun experiences, I decided to get some more and let my friend try some. I’m pretty new to hallucinogens and had only tripped accidentally (and unpleasantly) from the combination of MDMA and weed before. We went round to my friend’s house and went into his room. The lights were low and there was a red glow on the walls (this may of lead to the fleshy walls I mention later) and after a few beers, maybe five or six, we got out his home made bong. I let him go first but he couldn't manage to hold the smoke in and didn't get the full effects and instead felt like his body was moving and he felt disorientated. He wouldn't try it again after that so I decided to have my turn. I was feeling good and not nervous and completely ready so I took a big hit and held it in and sat back on the couch. I quickly got the complete loss of identity and knowledge of where I was I normally got but this time there were no giggles. I then must of slumped downwards as I was looking at my leg but I was still continuing to fall, losing my body at the same time and then I seemed to melt into my thy. I was familiar with the 'melting' as I had merged with whatever I was close to before but this time I couldn't grasp that it was my thy as I was inside whereas in past experiences I had just been stuck to the object. Inside it was similar to when in cartoons someone gets swallowed by a whale (Pinocchio?) complete with fleshy walls and bone structure. Colours to begin with were vivid but not in a fully psychedelic way but then the thought of other entities around me, this might be hard to explain, created psychedelic imagery of characters. I say imagery as they weren't visible as in I could picture them in a 3D way and touch them but they were there and I had an image of them. There were about three horse riding men who seemed Mexican in what they were wearing and the way their psychedelic colours were gave me the impression of a scorching desert. They, without words or sound, explained to me that they were here to help me remember my true identity, purpose and place. Without any real explanation from them things started coming back to me (I guess the Salvia wearing off). I firstly grasped that I was inside my own body and that these 'guides' were a part of me, although I had yet to discover who 'me' was.  This knowledge was enough to get me out of my thy and left me in my friends room but I had no idea what this place was and why I was here. It came to me that this was not how I normally feel and that left the same question of 'why is this happening' and ‘who am I normally’ going round my head. I also felt like my brain was trying to fit back into my body but it kept missing and couldn't lock on to it and that left me feeling like I was spinning and with each rotation my brain would miss. This made me feel quite dizzy. The whole time I had a feeling of fear of never being able to get back to where or who I was before and the whole prospect was daunting.Finally it hit me that I had done this to myself and that this was a voluntary experience. This thought helped my identity come back as the thought that I actually had some control over this was a sobering one. The spinning slowly subsided and my brain locked back on to my body. Even being fully aware of where I was and why it still took a while to get sentences out as I tried to explain to my friend what the hell just happened. The dizziness stayed for a while, longer than I had previously experienced. I think the alcohol had an affect on this.I have done it a few times since and have never had a stranger trip as this. I would of thought the alcohol would of dulled the effects. In a way the strangeness seemed dulled as it seemed less psychedelic and the objects were physical ones (like my leg) and I think the alcohol had maybe grounded the ability to completely abandon the physical world. In all I’d say that the alcohol prolonged the experience but didn’t hinder it at all nor did it make feelings of anxiety disappear. I was down town trying to get ahold of some hash and met up with a friend that was going to help me with my problem. He was located at this house where a friend of him was having a party, the trashed home due to excessive drinking while his parents are on vacation type of thing. At the time I was pretty ok, no recallable paranoia or anexiety of mentionable degree, but I was way sober. I got served coffee and 96%, it tasted crap but it did the trick, and because I hadn't been drunk in like 2 months, I was pretty soon drunk.When I visited vancouver earlier this year, I got 6 grams of salvia, and I've been doing some earlier, so I'm kind of familliar with it. When we was walking to from the house to some pub, I realized that I still had the bag of Salvia in my pocked. That made me happy, cause we didn't have any weed, and being drunk is really booring.Me and my friend started to eat, like first just a bit, then we had more, and by the time we arrived to the pub (not long time at all), I could clearly tell that salvia had influenced my brain.I got the usual things with salvia, like I don't really know where my body are, and I can't really identify the high, and my eyes get this natural openess and the vision and other senses feels so clear.Mixed with alcohol, it was pretty different. It was very easy to 'use' the salvia/alcohol energy, and I got really energic in a very strange way.After two beers we hit the street, having salvia in the mouth all the time. The people around us all looked grey and booring, and scary, the last thing we wanted was to end up like them. The only thing not bad was that we had each other, when I look back on the hazy memories it felt really good to have someone on the same wavelength beside me. We started hating all the stupid drunk people, and felt like starting a fight, so we walked around staring angry at them, we actually got really energic on the mixture, on one side very happy, but on the things we didn't like, we felt like using the energy in a very distructive way.This part of the night was interresting, I was in a much better mood that only alcohol, laughing alot, very happy very energic. But the world outside seemed alot more frightening than on only alcohol, and the party people appeared just as stupid as the always do. The night ended after using mail boxes for drums and listening to the streets acoustic (and the long talk with the cop who wanted our names), and after a while loosing my friend and roaming the streets alone and pretty freaked out, and finally stealing a bike to head home to another friend of mine.There I got a hit of hash, but was too friggin hyperactive to fall asleep (I've got adhd, and salvia seems actually to make me more hyperactive, not only in a negative way), and the fact that it was too hot and I was unable to sleep on my stomach cause of too much alcohol in it.But the morning after, I was behaving really strange. Really strange. I don't know why, but I was behaving (not acting) strange. It was really sketchy thinking back to it, I wasn't my self, and I wasn't hazy either, simply behaving strange.So if I should conclude a conclusion, it should probably go something like: 'Salvia and alcohol goes very well together during the trip, and enchances the good sides of the salvia, and the alcohol. Many of the things I've mentioned, like fear of the outside world, and all the stupid people in it, I have them anyway and isn't a big deal for anyone but me. The hungover mentioned, now that is something I haven't really experienced before, but it might be the combination of not sleeping at all and being hyperactive so I wasn't hazy at all. If I get the urge/simple upportunity to get drunk again, and have the acces to salvia, I'll use the two substances together, even if it does mean that the hungover will turn me into another personallity for a while, the final line will probably be something like: 'It makes alcohol intoxication more interesting.' So last night, I tested a curious potion. Tincture of yarrow herb in shitty vodka. (Flowering stalks harvested from Pacific Northwest roadside and dried in a paper bag. Plus the leftovers from a plastic handle of Monarch. Plus about 7 days.) The impetus for this was a brief collection of recipes exploiting yarrow's synergistic properties, which was tacked to the end of an article on its medicinal uses. For a couple of reasons (among others, it was the first herb I learned to recognize by smell), I consider yarrow to be a special plant, and since I had some dried herb hanging around for other purposes, I decided to go for it. After soaking for a week, the vodka had turned a light golden color (about the shade of  basic tequila), and after being strained through a coffee filter, it no longer smelled or tasted like vodka. Instead, it had an almost overwhelming floral odour and taste - more like a flowery schnappes than basic hard liquor. My total dose ended up being a little less than three shots worth, plus a cigarette and a reasonably strong gin and tonic. (The lot was spread out several hours.)In terms of straight alcohol, the amount I consumed over the night would have been enough to get me reasonably ruined. Yarrow, however, seems to make the effects of the alcohol significantly different. Although there's a loss of motor control, it's significantly less than I expect from the same amount of plain alcohol. The real defining characteristic of this brew is lucidity - to a nearly supernatural extent. Although I could feel the alcohol in my system, it was matched by a feeling that I was in complete control; that I was capable of taking in, synthesizing, and understanding information at a rate that dwarfed what I was usually capable of. A yarrow tincture gives the euphoria of alcohol without the stupidity. Interestingly, there was even a visual aspect to this effect. Everything looked sharper, somehow - I was intensely aware of the outlines and locations of everything in the immediate environment, as opposed to the blurring that alcohol generally engenders. When I was smoking the aforementioned cigarette (I smoke only occasionally, so a fag is a special occasion for contemplation and enjoyment), I had an amazing sense of the fluid dynamics of the smoke particles in the air, and could track the exhaled smoke much farther through the local atmosphere than I would expect to be able to.Overall, yarrow+alcohol made me feel simultaneously smarter and crazier. I feel like this would be a fantastic group drug, leading to some truly impressive exchanges of ideas and clashes of personalities, and I'm currently wondering what it could do when mixed with an inherently 'talky' flavour of alcohol, such as red wine or schnapps. (I see vodka as being a more stoic sort of trashed - it's the mascot drink of suffering in silence.) The hangover was rather odd, though. Normally, I'm superman w/r/t aftereffects (my most epic benders typically end with me getting up at 10 AM ready to take over the world), but this had some wierd stuff attached to the morning after. (Note that part of this might have had to do with being woken up way early by a phone call from the landlord and then going back to bed.) For one thing, this was my first specifically identifiable experience with sleep paralysis - I had this hallucination that there was a rodent of some sort running around in my bed, and I couldn't move enough to scare it off. There was also a headache of the sort that I usually manage to avoid with alcohol. A little background on my mental health and some of the substances I have experimented with: I am a very frequent Marijuana smoker (Daily), somewhat frequent drinker (Weekly). I've done Salvia a number of times, LSA twice and Kratom a few times. There are many other substances I plan on experimenting with, unfortunately most are very rarely available. I take 400 MG of Zoloft every night for Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD, which I have had for about as long as I can remember) and Remeron (15 MG I believe) to help me sleep.FIRST DAY: Preparation/ExperiencePreparation: Put about 4 tablespoons worth of Kratom (Normal Strength) into a coffee mug, mixed in enough vodka to encompass the Kratom, then covered the cup with plastic wrap and let it sit for about three hours. I then put the mug into the microwave for a few seconds, added more Vodka, stirred the concoction around and placed it back into the microwave. I continued this process until I felt content that enough of the Kratom had been extracted into the Vodka, at which point I filled the mug with water and warmed it up once more. I strained the remaining liquid into a separate cup, (squeezing left over clumps of Kratom with my hands to get out as much 'juice' from it as I could.) I mixed the finished product with some cola and syrup and drank down the bitter fluid over a period of 15-20 minutes.The Experience: The effects crept in within 15 minutes after ingestion. I decided to smoke some marijuana from my bong. After the first hit I felt completely inebriated. Kratom is incredibly synergenic with Marijuana, only a few hits and the high becomes overwhelming. Closed Eye Visuals, mild Open Eye Distortions, an overall shift of consciousness. Like a strong Marijuana high with the addition of a very pleasant, warm, happy, drunk sedated, dreamy feeling. I seem to remember my head feeling 'melty' as if parts of it were made from gelatin. I can't recall much more from that night, so forgive me if parts of this are somewhat vague...After a few hours of laying around, enjoying the very pleasing feelings of Kratom, the high began to wear off, this was when I decided to make another batch. I took the remaining 2 tablespoons worth of Kratom and prepared it the best I could. After drinking it, the high came back full force. Again, I can't remember very much.SECOND DAY: The HangoverI woke up the next day, I believe around 12:00 pm. feeling quite tired and sick. I seemed rather sensitive to the temperature, if I were to come out from under my covers and walk upstairs to get a drink, I would find myself feeling incredibly cold. Shivering and such by the time I got back downstairs. To sum it up, it felt like having a really, really bad cold, only without sneezing, coughing or having a sore throat. I noticed my lower back aching quite a bit. That whole day I didn't do much other than lay in my bed, take warm baths and drink water.Later on that night I was feeling somewhat better. I decided to take my temperature. 101.9 Quite a fever indeed, I should have taken it earlier, I'm almost certain it would have been higher. My mother gave me something to reduce the fever. My temperature was down to about 100.5 by the time I was ready to go to bed.THIRD DAY: The ItchI woke up feeling a great deal better, no more cold symptoms, no more back ache, no more fever. However, my body was quite itchy. When I had nothing to do, I found myself scratching my hands, arms and legs a great deal. I went to the mall that day to see some of my friends, still itching on and off. Other than the itching, I felt baseline, and was able to interact with everyone normally. By the fourth day the itch was completely gone.So, needless to say, I have some mixed feelings about my experience, while the high was indeed quite swell, the hangover was indeed quite shitty. Will I do Kratom again? I'd have to say all signs point to yes. It is still quite an enjoyable drug, I'll just make sure never to drink so much of it again. And while the hangover was by no means anything I would like to experience a second time. I have had a far worse hangover from alcohol, and that hasn't stopped me from drinking. Firstly I would like to state each of us is an individual but that doesnt mean we dont also have responsibilties to others in society. So I am not now nor have I ever recommended anyone else to take any drug or chemical substance.OK so my experience of speed (billy, whizz or white being other UK slang terms). I started to take speed around 97 to help me deal with a Degree course at Uni and holding down 2 jobs (one weekends and one on days off from Uni in the week). I had previously tried Cannabis and not had a problem with it, in my opinion it is no worse having the occasional joint than having a beer, but a friend then asked me if I had ever tried speed? I said no and then after a talk with my friend about it decided I would try some. My friend then offered me 1 gm of street Amphetamine Sulphate which I took in the form of a paper bomb swallowed with some water. After around 10 minutes I said to my friend 'nothings happening' the reply to which 'was give it a bit longer'. Next thing I knew it was 3 in the morning and I was sat in a motorway cafe drinking coffee with my friend and 2 other. I was also grinding my teeth talking, very rapidly and felt so full of ideas it was like the greatest buzz ever. This feeling lasted until around 9 am giving a total time of 10 hours since ingestition. Wow I thought this is great and over the next 6 months I used speed for runs of upto 5 days at the end of which I would crash for a day then the cycle would begin again for anything from 2 to 5 days. This was also combined with Cannabis and Alcohol (usually 1.5l white wine and vodka). My then partner (through my friend) also started using speed and so we both followed the pattern above.'So what' you might be saying 'sounds like fun?' Yes it was but thats the whole problem with Speed it made everything fun but it also turned off the part of my brain that says 'dont do that dont do this'. I lost touch with my own self-control and did things simply for the pleasure they gave at the most basic animal level. Making love becomes sex and I ignored the reality of life with its constraints such as finance management in favour of immediate satisfaction. The end result of this for me was a heart attack in 1998 that nearly cost me my life. I was then 34 and had never had any heart trouble previously. To those who have seen actors on tv portray a heart attack and think thats what its like you are wrong. It was the most painful experience of my  life to that point and it doesnt last for a few seconds either. Mine lasted for 2 hours before the clot was broken down by the drugs and my heart could function again. Following this I stopped Speed for nearly a year while my then partner carried on occasionally using it. But one night after a massive row with my then partner I tried it again and before long was back to using it although this time for no more than 2-3 days in a row max.My marriage broke down in 2001 due to our continued use of Speed as it turned me and my ex wife from being a loving couple into two people who could only see their own percieved needs rather than the needs of each other and our children. This led to arguments and an eventual split which has damaged both of us and our children. For 6 months I was alone until I found a new partner who is also a speed user (although I didnt know this until we had been together for a few weeks). Then in October last year (2002), after I had taken speed (2 grams Base Amphetamine) 6 hours before, I found myself lyeing on my couch feeling as if I was suffering a bad case of heartburn. So like most people I went to bed after taking an over the counter remedy (Rennie). This was at 1.00AM and I was rapidly coming down from the Speed. By 2.00AM I was in absolute agony and asked my partner for 2 aspirin (300mg each) and to call an Ambulance. She did this and on the arrival of the Medics she told them I had taken Amphetamine and been smoking Cannabis splifs (I have almost always smoked Cannabis Resin purchased for £25 pounds for half an ounce only rarely have I smoked Grass). They then took me in an Ambulance to hospital where I was seen by doctors who then gave me 5mg of DiaMorphine (Heroin) and the clotbuster drug Rapilysin (Reteplase). The pain was so intense it even overcame the DiaMorphine and the clotbuster drug itself on its first use did not break down the clot. But luckily at the second attempt it did and I was able to almost immediatly able to drift off into a state of total bliss. Following this I spent 7 days in hospital and now find I have changed from being someone who was fairly fit having played soccer and studied judo until the age of 32. Into someone who gets out of breath even walking too briskly and who can no longer enjoy my time playing soccer with my kids as I used to. I now also have to take various drugs for my heart, eat a set diet and constantly live with the fear of my kids seeing me collapse and possibly die in front of them.I have tried to make the above as concise as possibly but in summary speed cost me my marriage as it changed both me and my ex partner psychologically into more self centered people. It cost me my health and nearly killed me twice. But above all it cost me the purest buzz there is the buzz of spending real quality time with my sons. So if you are thinking of trying speed DON'T its not worth it it. Yes its fun, yes it gave me confidence, yes it made the mundane tolerable. But it also screws up my head, turns me into a bullshitter who cant shut up and who cant see it destroying my own health. I no longer use Speed and although yes I miss it at times I prefer to enjoy the real quality time that has been given to me through the work of the doctors who saved my life. Given a choice between Speed or a runout on my motorcycle with my partner on pillion on a sunny day give me the latter please. A Friday evening in an English suburb. I sat at home eating tea, while I waited for my friend R to return from town with an ounce of marajuana for our consumption that night. I looked forward to it with relative anticipation as I had not smoked for about a week, and not in that quantity for some time longer. The evening was to be relaxed as we planned to venture to nearby lakes to consume the cannabis.As I waited the doorbell rang, and it was my other friend J who told me he was the only person at home guarding a rather extensive selection of his mum's liquor. I decided that a drink would be the ideal start to the evening and texted R to tell him I was making the short journey to J's house, also in our suburb. On the way up to J's house it became clear he was already rather tipsy, and he told me he had had two drinks. This seems an appropriate moment to point out that I am recounting this tale with hindsight, the event occured when I, J and R were all 14, we are now 17. Henceforth we were unaware of the dangers of excessive consumption of alcohol - and especially the dangers of mixing ANY types of alcohol, let alone large quantities of spirits. After a short walk we reached J's house. He took me into his back room and proceeded to pour me a drink he had invented that night, taking a standard sized scotch glass he poured in around 2 shots worth of Gordon's Gin, approx. one shot's worth of a 65% mexican liquor (the name of which escapes me) and proceeded to 'dilute' this with some 15% vino. After one sip I knew it was horrible, and threw it down my neck as fast as possible. I then made my own drink, slightly varying the ingredients...I had more gin than before, added some whiskey and topped this up with ouzo (a greek aniseed flavoured drink). After drinking like this for 10 minutes we quickly became very inebriated (as one would expect). It was then that J made a decision that could potentially have saved our lives...he rang his girlfriend S to see if she could come over. After another round of drinks, which were now starting to taste wonderful, J entered with paracetamol - in our 'wisdom' we decided it would be fun to flaunt the 'not with alcohol' restrictions on the packet and took 4 each. This is where the night took a turn for the worse. For 5minutes after the paracetamol it bacame clear we were VERY DRUNK. I can remember falling over and laughing, me and J sang at the top of our voices to the CD which was now playing at ludicrous volume and another couple of quick rounds of drinks ensued. I remember feeling extemely giddy and happy, it was a pleasurable feeling - comparable almost to the love buzz of taking MDMA, although obviously not QUITE as intense as that. I was unable to stop laughing and so was J. However after that as the full extent of the alcohol diffused into my blood, I remember about 10 minutes TOTAL memory, in little flashes, from here (around 7PM) to next morning around 6AM. Hence the following is an acount pieced together from the reports of S and my family. S arrived and I then said we should make a trip to the local Mc Donalds to get some food. We left the house and headed down the street, apparantly J and I were being very loud and staggering all over the place. Then we had to walk up a 12-set of steps. Although I remember none of this it appears that I was leading the way, and behind me J fell, forwards, up the stairs. As I turned and tried to pull him up I only succeeded in pulling myself down, and I fell to the bottom. It became clear that J needed to go home as the alcohol had hit both of us hard, especially him as he was unable to get up. We carried him home, where his family were in and he received a subsequent berating, although I cannot remember any of it! As I was inexperienced with alcohol (certainly in this quantity) I decided it would be a good idea to go to McDonalds to get some food and hopefully sober up, so as not to arouse the suspicion of my parents. Apparantly on the walk we were asked by an old lady if S and I could help with her shopping. Being a conscientious and caring person I was shocked when S told me two days after the ordeal I had abruptly declined by telling her to 'fuck off and do it herself'. We reached McDonalds where S realised that I would probably say something to the staff there and wisely told me to wait outside. I remember absolutely nothing from this part, although I was told I proceeded to swing, gorillla style on the bar of the drive thru (that prevents tall vehicles entering) Amazingly no-one rang the police, I think anyway...I do then remember starting to experience something I had never felt before with alcohol or anytime, my whole body felt as though it was FULL of sick. I was extremely nauseous and was hardly able to stand. I truly believed I may be about to die. It was then that we decided to make the short walk away from civilisation, to the lakes, so I would not get us arrested. My last memory of the night is walking down the path forcing myself to eat chips...I woke up in my room, which stank of sick - despite the open window.It transpired that S had practically carried me home, although I had manged to get into bed myself. I lay there vomiting, and as I was laid on my back this was potentially fatal. Thankfully my sister entered the room to ask if she could borrow a CD of mine. She got my mum, who apparantly stayed up with me all night as I threw my guts up. I was obviously hungover all day next day. My head felt like it weighed a tonne and I couldn't stop being sick. Gutfulls of green bile coming up....However I believe the aftereffects far out-lasted the immediate hangover. Both J and I were almost sick at the smell of alcohol for literally a month afterwards. Even when we could bring ourselves to drink, we found our tolerance to alcohol had fallen to less than half of what it was previously - getting drunk off a few cans of lager etc. With hindsight I view this as a valuable experience in my development as a human being, as that night, I truly hit rock bottom and now thoroughly enjoy going out and getting pissed - with a stronger tolerance to alcohol than most of my friends. It started off as a harmless birthday party. My friends, Nic and Cat, were extremely lucky to get the flat they did. It's a basement flat and an old deaf lady lives above them so she doesn't hear the noise. Even the noise of approximately 40 people partying hard with the decks at full volume.I arrived at whatever time I arrived. I'm guessing that this was about half seven pm on the Saturday. I was one of the first to arrive, and indeed arrived before the hard-core drugs did, and before the music. So, smoking hash commences. So far it's not that jumpin a party, but then our guy arrives with some speed, pills, and for some reason a bottle of acid. I'm not sure why he thought the liquid acid would be any good at a party with forty people. Maybe he just happened to have it on him.Anyway, I bought a gram of speed and three pills. I took two pills and had a few lines of base while I was waiting to come up. The speed was great, and the pills were fine. I'm used to doing speed and pills; I do them on a semi-regularly basis just for a bit of fun. Everyone was having a fantastic time, the people who were wasted and the people who were straight (most of them were working the next day). There were people fire dancing, which just looks so amazing when you're on pretty much any drug, and still looks cool when you're not.I persuaded one of my friends to let me have a go of his pois (that's fire on chains). It's one of the most fun things to do while off your face. I'd recommend it to anyone, although you should definitely have several people watching you so that if you set your clothes on fire, someone notices for you, because you won't on you own! We have great photos of one of my friends totally covered in black slimy soot from the paraffin, but I digress.The bathroom was one of the quiet rooms of the house. It's a really big bathroom with lots of floor space, and lots of fucked people, for some reason, just began to congregate there. I believe it may have started off just being the bath. I have vagueish memories of sitting in the bath with other people. We talked, we occasionally danced, we smoked hash, and we were all having a great time. There were a few people (there always are at big parties) who were a lot more fucked than everyone else. One girl was wandering about in a daze for most of the night, speeding off her face. There was a guy there who ended up spending almost the entire night unconscious on the sofa. His head bounced spasmodically from side to side. I'm sure in his head he was having a fantastic time dancing away and chatting to people, but he was in fact totally monged out all night. He only opened his eyes when the music stopped (which was rarely) and just sat there looking confused for a few moments before it started up again. Everyone kept half an eye on both these people all night, and both were fine by morning.As the night progressed, those who were drug free left for bed. The remainder then separated into two groups. In one group were those for whom it had been enough. They'd either run out of drugs or were too knackered for the drugs to be working any longer. The first group was the one that I was in. We were the hardcore party animals who had been up for the whole night and decided that it would be a good idea to go and watch the sun rise. Eventually this was agreed on and we set off for the beach. It was cold and drizzling slightly. This was not a great environment for people who have been up all night on drugs. I think some of us were feeling that much more of this would simply lead to the dreaded comedown. We climbed the fence into the ruined castle, but we couldn't find a part of the castle that was sheltered enough to skin up in, so we just headed back. The sky was much lighter, but the sun was still not yet up.We sat for a while in the living room, our remnant looking more and more depressed as the minutes passed. People skinned up and joints were created, but this was no longer enough for any of us. Then someone suggested that we all go on an acid trip. It seemed like a really good idea at the time. I'd done acid before, but only in very small amounts--enough for a mild trip, but no more--so I was eager to try it properly. Seven of us ended up taking a taxi to the house seven miles out of town where we could trip for six hours or so uninterrupted.After sitting down and smoking a spliff or two, we got down to business. The guy with the acid reckoned that two drops of the liquid acid would suffice, judging on previous experience from the same bottle. There was one other person there who had never taken a big dose of acid. We agreed to keep an eye on each other. We were all experienced drug users, and expected just to have a laugh and ignore the hideous comedowns that had set in until we could sleep them off a bit later in the day. I don't actually remember what it tasted like now, but I remember discussing it at the time.So that was it; the deed was done. All we could do now was wait. I remember wondering how long it would take. We decided that the curtains should be closed. The view outside wasn't very stunning, and the cold and the wet looked unpleasant, although the sky was starting to clear by then. I think it was about ten am on the Sunday, but I'm not entirely sure.We sat and smoked up some more, waiting, listening to music. I have no idea how long after that we actually started tripping, but I do remember sitting on the sofa looking at the ceiling, fascinated for a while before I realised that it had started. The ceiling was made of pine and was full of knotholes. I'm not sure what drew my eye up there, but I noticed that some of the dark knots had started to move around the ceiling. I pointed this out to everyone, and soon we were all there.It's amazing how quickly time passed and how far things degenerated. We spent a long time sitting and chattering amongst ourselves. My brain turned to putty and I kept saying things that I didn't mean to say. It wasn't that I didn't want to say them, it's just that my train of thought started coming out my mouth. I couldn't stop stating really obvious things like 'The sky is blue' and asking really mundane questions. It made people laugh and it was interesting to see what the LSD had done to my brain.Going to the toilet turned out to be a bit of an adventure. That sounds slightly wrong, but it really was. I'd been in the same room the whole time and hadn't even tried walking or standing. When I did get up to go after a few hours of sitting on the floor, it was like trying to walk on the moon. My depth perception was fucked, and I could watch my legs bending and stretching out and shrinking and folding. It was great! As I hadn't left the room before, I didn't know what the rest of the house was like. I was very confused. There were stairs everywhere. Some of the staircases were really narrow and long. Others were wide, but only had three or four steps. I was very confused at the time. I couldn't decide whether or not I was hallucinating all these stairs. There seemed to be a set between every single room. I later on confirmed that this was the case. The house we were in had been built upon an old ruin and started off very small with bits and pieces being added over the years. It was a fantastic house for a trip. In the toilet on the window ledge there were some ornamental shells. There appeared to be lots and lots of spider web just on that shelf and nowhere else. I couldn't tell if it was real or not, but the spiders kept me from investigating further.Back in the main room, the knots in the ceiling had turned into beetles and were running all around, but this was ok as the ceiling was where they 'belonged' and I intuitively knew that they would stay up there. I had a brief look outside the curtains, but the alien landscape outside was a bit daunting, so I decided to leave it alone. The joint-making had suddenly become very bad indeed. Everything looked wrong. All the dimensions were warped. I tried rolling some cigarettes, and that was difficult enough. It took an enormous amount of concentration. The result of five minutes' work looked extremely strange. Anything we rolled always seemed too short, but the length of the skins hadn't changed. It was a bit of a mystery. Smoking itself was great fun though. Occasionally it was hard to work out if we'd ashed the carpet by mistake or if something had fallen off the end of the spliff or roll-up, but usually after checking the carpet nothing had. Watching the smoke curl and float about was fantastic. At times it looked solid and so real, but then my perception would shift again slightly and I'd see infinitely deeply into the smoke and out the other side. It's a difficult thing to describe, but it was mesmerising.After maybe four or five hours of this, one of us received a phone call to say that their flat was being inspected. The poor guy who had been phoned had absolutely no idea what to do. We were all far too fucked to be of any help cleaning up the flat. That was our first stress. I remember looking at the clock at that point to check how long it was until the flat inspection was supposed to occur. This was almost impossible. At one point the three different hands on the clock ticked in three different directions, even though there are only two directions (clockwise and anticlockwise) possible and only one direction they were made to go in. I realised at that point that my brain was fucked enough to be creating three dimensions out of two-dimensional object. I decided that now would be my best chance ever of imagining a hyper-cube (a four-dimesional cube for those of you who don't know), or better yet--as three dimensional representations of four-dimensional cubes are almost possible, making them easier to picture--a hyper-sphere would be really really impressive. I spent about five minutes doing this. My brain boggled and came close to leaking out my ears. I decided it would be better just to leave it for another time. I kept being destracted by the stress of my fellow trippers.Our second stress, and first major problem occurred at about four o'clock. The guy to whom the house we were in belonged received a text message from his parents to say that they were coming home early (they hadn't been due back for a day) and would see him in about an hour. At this point things became really confusing for me. We managed to work out that we'd all have to leave. We also had to tidy up and leave no evidence of our being there. The problem was that we couldn't agree on where to go. I reckoned the best place would be to go back to the party flat that we'd started in. It would be safe there, and people would understand our predicament and leave us to come back down to baseline. Others believed that heading for the fields to look for magic mushrooms would be a much better idea. We eventually got the place tidied up, but it took a long time and a lot of effort. People started making toast and soup, thinking that this would help in some way. The windows were opened to let the room air, but this was confusing as the wind began blowing things around. I remember some of the observations I made at the time. One that sticks out was that we had been reduced to mob mentality. A person can be intelligent, but people are stupid. We were like people, I realised. Not just seven people. We were more like 700 all trying to do the same task. We got in each other's way, we drifted about aimlessly, and we did things that didn't need to be done. Eventually we got organised enough to think properly about leaving and where to go. I remember being really proud of our achievement at this time. I decided that we were like different facets of the same mind. We had had a goal, and we had achieved it. We'd done what we set out to do, and somehow the idea of a hive-mind seemed agreeable to me at the time. We were just deciding that it would be a good idea to get in a taxi back to town when a taxi pulled up outside. After a moment's conference we discovered that someone had already phoned one and forgotten about it completely.Just a quick note here: at the time I didn't know that we were tripping more heavily and for longer than we'd intended. It was my first time taking this much acid, so I thought that this was all going to plan, except of course the early return of parents. I was very happy up until the point that we left the house. There were stresses and problems, but they weren't my worries. I could try and help, and just tried not to think about the fact that we had to leave the house. It made me feel a bit panicky, thinking about how we were going to get the seven miles back into town in a direction I didn't know and go somewhere we hadnt' decided, so I just didn't think about it until I had to.It took us so long to get out to the taxi that he'd started to drive off, but one guy ran after it and stopped him. I have no idea what he said to convince the driver to let seven heavily-tripping people into his taxi, but it worked. I was sat in the back and the guy I was sitting next to started talking to me about stabbing a biro pen into the neck of the taxi driver to stop him telling anyone. I thought/hoped he was joking and went along with him for a bit. I couldn't tell how loud we were talking though and started to worry that the driver could hear us. We got back into town and the driver asked us where in town we wanted to go. Seven different voices stated seven different destinations. The taxi driver said that he'd just drop us off where we were so I shouted over them all and told the driver to take us to the street the party had been on. This was where the party had started, and it seemed fitting to me that it should also end there.We got out the taxi and someone paid the driver. We'd almost forgotten.We were all just heading down to the original party flat, when some of us decided that the pub would be better and our local was the safest. Apparently people were thinking that if we went back to the flat we'd get roped into cleaning up, which, in our hallucinatory state, would not have been easy. I remember asking everyone individually if they'd rather go to the pub or back to a nice flat where we could chill, and only one person actually wanted to go to the pub. However, the group mind had already decided and there seemed to be no way out of it. We walked into the pub at about half past five on the Sunday evening. Thankfully it was quiet. There were only about six people there, and I knew most of them at least vaguely. Perhaps this wouldn't be too bad after all. Some of us sat down, and some of us ordered drinks. I sat down and waited to see what would happen next. The general opinion seemed to be that we were going to have a drink here and then move on to the flat, but, of course, it really didn't work that way.We were in the pub for almost three hours. Those were the worst three hours of my life. I think that I started really coming down off the speed from the night before about then. I started getting intensely paranoid. I remember trying to interact with some of the people there, but the attempt was futile. I'd hear them say half of a sentence that made no sense before they descended into what seemed to me to be complete gibberish, not even speaking words.During those hours, I sat mulling over what course of action I should take; many thoughts crossed my mind. I considered killing everyone, or myself, or screaming at everyone to stop fucking with my mind. Words can't express that experience. I know now what a bad trip is be like, but I would still do it again. I was actally in hell for what felt like days. However, I pride myself on the fact that I didn't completely freak out. On the inside, I completely fell apart, but outwardly I was fine. I was told that my eyes were as big as saucers the whole time I was there, and my sober friends could tell that all was not well, but I didn't completely break down.My thoughts were running in circles. Random thoughts were going through my head that I had no real control over. I felt my mind fracture and splinter, and it was such an effort just to keep myself in the seat, but on the other hand, I felt that I couldn't leave everyone else because I would then be truly alone and I was scared. I was terrified that I wouldn't recover and that I'd spend the rest of my life in this living hell. I felt so small and fragile. I honestly contemplated suicide and murder, and for a while I actually did think that I was already dead and that this was hell.I don't know how bad that was, but I do know that things could have gone a lot worse. If I had lost my self control, I honestly would completely have freaked out. I had a long time to think about many things. I don't know whether or not the conclusions that I made during that time are correct or not, but I do know that I learned a lot about myself and the way my mind works. I survived.I could tell myself that this was something beyond my control, that the tripping would stop at somepoint, and that everything would be normal again. I'm not sure if it would have been better if I'd left the pub or not. I do know that I couldn't though. I had to stay with the other tripping people. I wasn't ready to face the world on my own. I became extremely insecure.I'm going to try and record some of the conclusions that I made while I was in this state. It's going to be hard to put into words though.At several points, I could feel my mind fracture and spin off in different directions. It was a bit like the clock from before. The clock whose hands went in three different directions. I had more than one train of thought running at once. It's an extremely bizarre feeling. I couldn't focus on anything for more than a few seconds...literally. I don't know how many times I asked when we were going to head back to the flat, but I think it was quite a lot.I remember feeling me trying to hide within myself, that is, my self awareness or my consciousness was retreating deeper and deeper. I think that this was some kind of defense mechanism. I was trying to get away from what I was experiencing, but I couldn't physically get out, only hide myself mentally. At the time, I thought that this might be how some patients at mental hospitals must live. It frightened me to realise just how much acid can fuck a person up.I'm giving up on trying to describe this properly. I can't even remember it clearly and I really can't find the words to convey what it was like. I've spoken to some of the people that were in the pub at the time. I wanted to find out how much they had been trying to fuck with us, and it turned out not to be that much at all. I could have sworn that half of the time I was there, people were trying to mess with our minds. That, however, was just my mind messing with me.Having experienced this though, I'd still say that acid is a really fun drug to use, but in future I'm going to treat it with a bit more respect and caution. I know that I have a tendency to rush into things without really thinking the consequences through properly, but at the same time I have an excellent capacity to look after myself.I spent over a week dazed and confused from that experience. I later learned that our dosage had been misjudged. The fact that we'd been up all night partying hard and taking other drugs was not taken into account and what was supposed to be a mild six-hour trip became a twelve hour epic adventure. This is an experience that I will never ever forget, and something that I hope I can really learn from. I know that I have already gained a lot of knowledge about myself. I know it's a bit of an acid cliche, but it's one of those cliches that you really don't appreciate until you've been through it yourself. It takes a lot of strength to face yourself on a hellish introspective acid trip-gone-wrong. It's definitely not something that I wanted to experience, but I've done it and in a way I'm glad that I have.For anyone that's taken the time to read this, sorry for the meandering aspect of this account. I have a tendency to ramble a bit. On the whole I reckon it really was a positive experience and it's definitely not put me off trying acid again in the future. I'm not really sure what that says about me as a person, but once again I don't really care. I'm happy being who I am. I bought guarana from a Holland and Barrett on the emphasis of several psychoactive plant information web sites, stating that taken with alcohol, very desirable effects are to be had. They did not state however exactly what these effects would be. Anyway the night started out like many other of my Saturday nights…me, my cousin and a mate waiting for a taxi to take us up town. We took three high strength guarana tablets each, each tablet containing 1200 mg of guarana. Half an hour later we were a pub, had a pint each then came to the conclusion that it wasn’t a very good pub so we soon left.Our second destination was Wetherspoon’s, a local bar. This was where the fun started, well for me anyway. After I had consumed 2 and a half pints of blackthorn cider, and around 7 bottles of wicked blue (to get the taste of the cider out of my mouth). I decided to have a ginseng capsule at this point to try and kick-start the guarana, it seemed to work as within a matter of minutes I was starting to feel very light headed. I would have usually of been feeling drunk by now but this was definitely a different feeling. Five minutes later I found that I was starting to laugh and the most ridiculous things, and I mean really laugh, at one point I genuinely couldn’t stop and laughed for roughly 10 minutes straight.We decided to leave quickly because we were getting funny looks off the staff, so we eventually ended up at the vodka bar (a bar upstairs and club downstairs). By this point I was definitely drunk but I also had so much energy. We went downstairs to the club and I rushed onto the dance floor without a care in the world.My cousin at this point who had the same amount of guarana as me, was suffering from a migraine (he does not think this was due to the guarana) and therefore had hardly any booze at all that night. My mate however also drank relatively little but said that he felt a light buzz.I however at this point had gone completely mental and I was running around the dance floor like a maniac, I slid across the floor on my knees several times and repeatedly knocked my cousins drink over (completely unintentionally). In retrospect I am surprised that I was not thrown out of the place they must surely of thought that I had taken something rather more illegal than guarana.When the place closed it was two o’clock in the morning but I could of carried on dancing (if that was what you would call it) for hours longer. We eventually arrived home at roughly three o’clock and I was surprised at how tired I had become by this point, I had read about the drug causing insomnia and was surprised this was not the case with me. The next morning I woke up without a hangover but feeling very drained and somewhat nauseous when walking around. But after I had a cup of green tea I was feeling a lot better and had recovered some energy again. Overall I would say guarana is a fairly safe drug to use within limits, I personally doubt I will ever take more than five tablets in one night. I don’t think it really has much of an effect without alcohol and I would say it is a very fun going-out or party drug and certainly livens up a night. Its effects I would imagine are very similar to speed or amphetamines without as much euphoria. A safe and easy to get drug. Mixing it with other caffeine products reportedly enhances the effects of guarana so I will certainly try that within the next few days. Thanks for reading, enjoy yourself! Mental preparation. One must remember this. Do not overhype the moment. Do not worry too much. Relax and let yourself drift.The first time I had done mushrooms, I had had a glowing time. Nothing to mind blowing or exciting, and I felt good enough after to consider doing it again. Out of the two grams I had from my initial taking, I had a good 0.75 grams left. Most of it being powder, it was probably closer to one gram of concentrated material.A week after my first trip, I decided to use up what I had left. I was leaving on a long three month trip in the next two weeks, and didn't want any illegal material hiding in my room for anyone to find. It was a spontaneous spur of the moment thing, and I was frankly more concerned about using the shrooms up as opposed to having a good time. I was hanging out with a few friends that night, going to see a favorite band at a favorite club…relaxed, comfortable setting. I went to pick up my friend and informed her I would be taking off that night, so to speak. I showed her what I had left and she doubted the amount. 'Are you even going to feel anything on that?' I was adamant I'd at least feel half as good as my first time (ah, reflections on the second tab of X I took after that magical first time) and told her it didn't even really matter anyhow. We took off, and went to a bar beside the club to chill out and wait for my brother. We each sipped on a beer, and I took off to the women's washroom to take my dose. The Ziploc bag, jammed, crumpled and twisted, had really crunched up the poor little guys. I had a few stalks and a lot of powder…good, in hindsight. I took the bag and just crunched down on what was left. It's strange, maybe, but I enjoy the taste of the mushrooms, reminds me of grass or hay. I had a good little paste going, and had to swallow that with some water, but headed back out to the bar floor. My friend raised her eyebrows, I nodded, and slugged my beer back. About ten minutes later, we head out and pick up my brother. To give some background, this was the first real time I'd been out with my brother in a bar, ever. He was totally unaware I was high, or that I've ever been high. He's not a bar kinda guy, but I figured he might like to come out, as he gets along with my friends. We waited in line, and things were progressing well. The rest of my friends were 2 people behind us, and the line-up was moving smoothly. Then…*bang*…guest list people. About twenty-five people show up from NOWHERE, and hold up the line. That's when I start to get all giggly…not so much impatient though. I'm feeling a bit fuzzy, happy, not as cold as I should be for the snowy weather we were having. FINALLY get in, and I'm like a hound from hell, running to the dance floor. I'm in that state of awe when something first hits me…the 'wow' feeling. No where near the good stuff, but feeling all right. I grab a double gin and tonic and sip on it periodically. It's not a drinking night, but I need something to hold onto as my hands tend to float away and clench if I'm not careful. I do not feel sick like I did the first time, maybe the alcohol helped? Thinking back, now, I hardly felt the effects of it at all. I talk to some people I know, walk around and explore as I often do. The music makes me feel like I'm tunnelling under the club. I'm trying to walk through the packed room, and am misjudging people's distances. My brother asks me why I'm meandering and walking strange. I stop and start in the crowd, unsure if they have stopped moving or if…oh wait, it's me, I realize as people shove past me. I'm chattier with people. Especially with my brother… We were standing at the back of the room and he said something very out of character. It made me, in my messed up mind, think he had taken something as well. I think start to tell him about how 'I'm on something' and, due to the loud music, he mishears me. I freak out and change what I told him to 'I once took some stuff, you know' and he gets very disapproving and upset. He's two years my junior, but is a paramedic and does not believe in drug use at all. He starts to tell me about how he used to look up to me, and how I'm a bad person… I run away, down to the bathroom. My female friend comes with me, and I stare at myself in the mirror for a while. The mirror is pulsing. I take my curly hair down from it's ponytail, and admire it's fluffiness. I touch it, and it's like the seeds that come off of a dandelion or pussywillow. My shirt deepens in color to be a dark pink, and my eyes look interminably green…the bits I can see around my pupils anyhow. I then race back upstairs after my friend calms me, and chomp down on some gum. The menthol lifts me up, and I feel better. Then I see my ex-boyfriend across the room. I had broken up with him a few months previous, and he had taken it hard. It was not a good break up, I suppose. All of my friends and my brother go to talk to him. I stand in a corner, wondering what to do. I don't want to give him the wrong impression, but at the same time, I want to feel familiar and comforted by his presence, and I also am battling sympathetic feelings towards him. Finally, friend in tow, I go talk to him. I tell him right up front that I'm high. The music is pulsing through my body, and I'm trying not to run to the dance floor. Smells of weed and perfume are intoxicating, distracting. He's got a notebook and a pen, and I write for a bit. I don't talk too much, but mostly talk around him. I leave him, and try to focus on the feelings of deja vu I'm battling. I'm living out a dream I had had two nights previous about a waterfall and zoo, and want to try and tell someone, but can't explain it well enough. Time is racing beyond me, but I feel stuck in a zone. My brother, friend and I go to sit down. People walk past and grin at me, and only me, I feel. We are sitting under a blue light, and I turn to talk to my brother. I stare at him, without blinking and he mentions it. He does not notice my pupil dilation. As I stare at him, he turns into some sort of toad… his skin a slight green/blue, and his acne red warts. It reminded me of Toad from 'X Men'. It upset me, and he was not very responsive to me wanting to hug or be friendly with him. I was really freaked out and so instead concentrated on some gridding that was happening to my right. There was a fence that was starting to cover the entire room. My vision was splitting a bit, and I was only able to hear half of what was going on at my table, as other people's conversations seemed to be coming in loud and clear. Everyone looked familiar to me, even if I had never met them. Jokes were twice as funny, and I felt wittier than usual. I then went to dance…and dance…and dance. Every time I closed my eyes, it's as if vines were growing over them. Ice crystals formed once, and the light I saw when I opened my eyes refracted more and more. I didn't necessarily feel like I was acting strange, but felt like others were. I thought almost everyone was high on something, and that everyone who looked at me knew I was, too. It was a sort of paranoia. As the night went on, I came down a little more, it wasn't a drop out of the sky episode. Three hours later, I was pretty much sober again, although really tired. I tried to eat at a diner, but found the people there too strange and the food too gross to eat. The next day, after a good sleep, I felt great. A few memory problems in the next few days, but I have a bad memory anyhow. I guess I can officially say I'm a shroom head now! This was my second encounter with the infamous white devil and, since the last experience dispelled all of my fears about the drug, I looked forward to this with some giddy anticipation.I did two small lines, which affected me almost instantly. There was a slight burning sensation in my nose afterward (which is to be, obviously, expected), an unpleasant taste in the back of my throat, and an almost instantaneous numbness in my lips, tongue and gums. Within minutes I experienced euphoria and intense stimulation. My thoughts were racing and my body felt invincible, as if I could fly. My muscles hardened, and I felt as if I could barrel through the thickest brick walls with my bare fists. An indescribable surge of emotion, physical pleasure, mental clarity, paranoia and apocalyptic sorrow hit me in one lump some and I felt as if I was experiencing all that could be experienced by a human being in one grand, glorious instant. Several more lines were snorted, and we ventured onward.As my friends and I made our way to a restaurant, I found my appetite completely absent, and the thought of eating brought waves of intestinal resistance (nausea?). I kept telling my friends how much I loved them, and was overcome with the urge to embrace them all.As the evening wore on, more lines were snorted and I seemed to remain at a state just below that of the peak until the coke ran out and we moved on to the alcohol and marijuana. I could distinctly feel when the cocaine euphoria transitioned into the marijuana euphoria, the former heightening my standard experience of reality and 'sharpening' my mind (though, when in this state, it is very difficult to concentrate on one thing for a long period of time) while the latter 'thickens' my mind, slowing my thoughts and disconnecting them from each other and from the reality I perceive. Cocaine increases my rational and emotional range, while marijuana decreases the rational and heightens the emotional. I associate giddiness and escape with weed, and cold, powerful understanding with cocaine. I prefer the latter drug, which, ater my last experience, I have deemed the 'god' drug, for it imbues me with such feelings of stength and brilliance. It is truly an egoist's substance.I could not really differentiate the alcohol (which takes much longer to affect me than the other said substances) from the marijuana, a drug which this time as always, gives me a profound feeling of disconnection from time and my environment. I feel 'lost' while on it, as if floating in some great oblivion while retaining consciousness (an impaired consciousess, one of a child / animal) a base consciousness in which the magnified emotions, which I believe are triggered by what is perceived and filtered through the rational mind, seem to be ddoing the thinking. This was a far cry from the very 'connected,' 'living-in-the-moment' feeling of cocaine.Doing both together made for an interesting mental journey, one that seemed to last for days (because of the contrast of states), and, throughout my sourjour, I experienced the most intense love and compassion of which I think I am capable, the most overwhelming despair and the most glorious anger and arousal.Alcohol, which I did not feel during this particular journey, is the opposite of cocaine, for it allows me to remain connected to that which I deem 'reality,' but it slows my thoughts and dulls my emotions. It provides a great remedy for the horrible coke come-down (prepare for despair if unarmed with some liquor). Coke brings me up, alcohol then brings me down, so that attaining the median (sober) state is more enjoyable (for lack of a better word).That is really all I have to say. I recommend all three drugs highly, to be employed for specific purposes. I'm a regular pot smoker; I've drank a lot and smoked a lot on more than a few occasions.  As far as substances go, this night should have been like any other.  However, I somehow managed to black out and have convulsions on my friends floor and I'm not sure exactly how this happened.Like I said, it was just a typical night at a party.  I brought wine, so I had been drinking, but I was by no means heavily intoxicated.  A friend and I went for a walk and smoked a few joints, both of which I inhaled more plentifully than my friend and continuously held the smoke in my lungs for at least fifteen seconds every hoot.  I'm a welfare weed smoker, so I have to be sure to maximize my high with whatever weed is available to me at any given time.  Anyway, by the time we walked back to the party I was noticably intoxicated as a few of my sober friends took pleasure in pointing out, but I had been way drunker and way higher other times. That night I learned that it's probably a better idea to participate in the the social life of the party rather than sitting alone on a couch, basking in your own altered state of mind.  There I was, just relaxing on the sofa, (apparently the party was happening outside more than inside and there weren't many people around to begin with.)  We all know the the 'spinning' effect of alcohol when you close your eyes, so usually I intentionally refrain from closing my eyes and if I do it's when I'm uncontrollably falling asleep on some dudes living room floor or something.  While I was just sitting there I kept closing my eyes and just loving the dizzying, spinning feeling that remarkably escalated the longer I continued to close my eyes and relax.  I had that feeling in my gut that I get when I'm on a crazy rollercoaster, times ten.  And for some reason I was just digging this, sitting there with with a huge grin on my face.  It was a real sense of euphoria.  I felt like laughing out loud and I didn't care that I was just sitting there smiling like an idiot.After doing this for what I would think was a good ten minutes, I made my way to the washroom with a sneaking sensation that I might vomit.  I recall standing in the washroom just waiting to see what my belly was up to, and upon deciding that I wasn't gonna spew, I started walking back into the living room which now had about five people in it.  (Maybe there were some people around the whole time, that obviously didn't matter to me at the time.) After a few steps out the washroom, I am told, I literally just hit the floor and went into spasms.  My left arm in particular was twitching pretty good.  My eyes were rolled in the back of my head and I just freaked everyone out who was at the party.  I felt so guilty for putting my girlfriend through that.  They were gonna call an ambulance or something, but I guess I regained conciousness five minutes later.  After that, I was still out of it but I couldn't logically accept what people were telling me had just happened.  When I woke up the next day, it was just surreal; I had no recollection of fainting, of course, and I couldn't really concieve why it had happened, except for my intentional enjoyment of closing my eyes and spinning excessively.  This is my only bad experience with weed ever, not including those times when we run out of weed before we get a satisfying high, or when we are really high and we don't have any good food, it's not really the same thing.  Everyone I mentioned this to later claimed it was a freak incident, and I guess I might as well consider it just that.  All I know is that next time I want the feeling of being on a rollercoaster I'll go to a theme park, or go for a ride in the washing machine or something. It was a Friday night, about 9pm, four friends (L, J, A, and S, for anonimity's sake) and I were at a rock/space-rock gig. It was a time of my life where I'd never felt emotionally or psychologically stronger. I wasn't anticipating getting drunk, since I had work in the morning. But I gave in to the temptation, and ended up having about 7 or 8 (I can't remember exactly) pints of standard 5% alcohol beer. We went back to L's early, because S had been struck in the head with a guitar after a rather frantic 'emo mosh pit'.When we got back, J had prepared a spliff, a bong and a pipe, for the use of him and I. It was about 11pm now. As my judgement was impaired, I had three hits off the bong and two hits off the pipe in very quick succession. Feeling hungry, me and J decided to go outside and take a walk to a Turkish Kebab house (at least, I think it's Turkish!). It was at this point I realised I was incredibly stoned, more so than I've ever been in my life. I doubt I was hallucinating, but it's a possibility. On the way, I saw blood on the floor. Obviously I was scared, but then thought of myself in an old-time mystery movie, and I could hear a tinkling silent film-style piano. About three people walked past on the way past the car-park, and of each one of them I believed they were responsible for the blood on the floor, and I kept running away in hysterics, not knowing if this was unbelievabely scarey or hilarious.I had never felt so happy and at peace of mind in my life, and I kept thanking J for getting me high. It was quite possibly the first time I've been stoned. Other noteworthy things I saw on the way was an old man in a wheel chair who just sat outside a church. I felt like he was at the same peace of mind as I was.When we got to the restaurant, it felt like I was on holiday, with the employees talking in their native tounges. I enjoyed revelling in the fact that I was stoned as well as actually being stoned. Once our garlic pizzas were ready, and we took them back to L's. On the way there, we met a guy who had just had a line of cocaine. I can't remember what he said, but he seemed really high! Anyway, we were finally at home. Eating my pizza whilst watching the tele could have been the perfect end to a nice night out, but for some reason, I decided to have two more bongs and another pipe. BIG mistake! Within five minutes of this incident, my heart was racing incredibly fast. Because I was relatively inexperienced, I didn't know that a fast heart beat was normal, and I got really scared. It felt like I had a hole in my chest, and that my heart was going to explode. I sat down on the couch in the other room to try settle myself down and take my mind off my heart, but to no avail. I was in the middle of a panic attack.One of my friends (I can't remember who) took me upstairs. At this point I swear I was hallucinating. I was seeing rather odd and colourful geometric shapes and toy-like animals in my head, and they seemed shockingly familiar, yet I have no recollection of seeing them before in my life. I got into a bed, and just lay there, shivering and convulsing. I couldn't tell wether I was hot or cold. I kept seeing these shapes and colours that, in my current state of mind, believed I used to imagine them when I was a child to make me feel secure. It was like a natural mental defensee against the fact that I was going to die.The only thing I could think of doing was trying to concentrate on my racing heart beat. I kept hearing voices in my head, like chants, which changed in optimism depending on how nervous I felt. When I felt I was going to die, the chants were akin to 'forgive me and I'll be better in the next life', but when I was starting to feel like I would pull through, the chants were similar to 'Dear God, please save me from this place'. Some of the chants were so poetic that I could vividly remember them the next day and I wrote them down.I asked one of my friends to ring an ambulance. After he'd rung the ambulance, I decided to get out of bed and take a wee. According to L, it was the longest wee he'd ever witnessed in his entire life. After I'd urinated, I suddenly felt quite a lot better, and then thought 'Oh shit! They phoned an ambulance!' When I got out the ambulance, there were two male nurses (or something) who helped me down stairs and into the back of the ambulance. I remember one of the nurses being surly, and saying 'you know what you've been doing to get in this state' and I thought 'damn'. The other nurse was very positive and encouraging, though I have no recollection of what he actually said. On the way to the hospital, I saw my pulse rate on a monitor, it said 180. I don't know wether this was my actually heart rate in BPS or what, but I felt comfortable now I was in the ambulance.When I was finally in hospital, I was in a hospital bed. Oddly, I kept breaking wind all the time, and i still don't know why! A doctor checked up on me every now and then. I remember the bed being so uncomfortable! But I seemed to be at peace again. Soon, it was 4am, and a nurse informed me that I was allowed to go home. I thought to myself 'how the hell do I get home?! I don't even know where the hospital is!' She told me that I could either ring someone up to pick me up, or I could sleep over at the hospital. A nurse told me how to use the phone and get through the switchboard etc, but I was too drunk to figure out how to use the phone. I wandered around the hospital for a while, exploring it, and eventually decided to fall asleep in the waiting room across some chairs.When I woke up, which was about ten o' clock (I always have trouble sleeping when under the influence), I imediately thought 'oh no! I have to be at work!'. Since I didn't have my wallet or my mobile phone, the only option was for me to walk five miles to my sister's house. I walked out of the hospital without registering, and took a long walk thinking about the night before. Everything seemed beautiful and vibrant, and even though I was a little bit lost (it was a part of town I've only been to once or twice), I felt happy and lucky to be alive, and never took my life for granted again. During a state of mind in which you think you're going to die, you vow never to do what you did again, that is, if you live. Your sins race through your head, and you try to weigh up what you could do right now in order to reach the afterlife. Is it REALLY possible for me to repent everything now, of all times, dying due to commiting a 'sin' (smoking pot)? The only thing you can do is pray for a second chance (even though it is probably your tenth chance) and promise yourself you will never do anything so stupid again.A few months have gone by now, and I am still edgy, and don't feel as emotionally strong. I get scared at night again, and I feel paranoid. Yet I still smoke weed. I have no idea why I still smoke it. Surely I can't be addicted? I believe the reason is because I want to feel that euphoria again, of being in complete peace and acceptance. I want to feel that way all the time. My memories of this event are a bit fuzzy, due to being intoxicated off my ass.  I will try to be as accurate as possible.It was a Friday night,..or was it a Saturday…well, that’s not really important, but I know it was at night.  My group of friends and I started the evening with a nice bowl of mary jane. We were all in a generally good mood, in a very comfortable enviroment at my friend's house. For the marijuana, we used my favorite instrument, the steamroller, individually taking a couple of tokes, and giving each other shot guns.  Being the sick and twisted individual that he was, my friend Chuckles wanted to see someone fucked up and wasted for his viewing pleasure.  He broke out the Bacardi 151, the drink we called ‘satans piss’.   Chiefly named for its foul taste, and the burning sensation produced as it flows down your esophagus and ignites your inner organs.  He passes the drink, but to no avail, as no one was stupid enough to partake.  No one that is, except me.  Me wanting to be the daring path-weaver, the one who always went first, I said “what the fuck, pass it over here.”Now, I already had a nice high going, but no, I had to fuck shit up and go too far.  Bacardi 151 is 75% alcohol, and yup, you guessed it, 151% proof.  The accounts are as documented:1st shot- I feel good, my high is intensifying, and I feel somewhat like I’m flying. The high could be compared to smoking two and a half bowls. At this time, all is good.2nd shot- I’m pretty much drunk at this point. Much more drunk than high. Everyone gawks that I’ve taken a hit so strong.  I feel giggly and silly, and speaking off and on in Japanese.  I insist on narrating a movie where all watching, rather loudly in fact.   Not wanting the high to subside, I proceed to drink again.3rd shot- I’m dancing...err, trying to.  Unlike ecstasy, where I have perfect coordination, and indefinite groove, my motor skills told me to fuck off, and jumped out of a window or something, cause their no where in site.  I can barely stand, I fumble a lot, and I mistake a friend for my boyfriend and lay on him.  Thinking becomes strangely difficult, and responses are definitely slower than usual.   Needless to say, I wasn’t a pretty site.4th shot- It gets ugly, so ugly that I can’t recall it all.  I do remember throwing up on my friends couch, (eh, sorry bout that Chuckles). After the couch, on the floor, and after the floor, finally in the toilet bowl, where I stayed for several minutes after playing in the toilet water.  It was fun no longer.  I tried to lie down, to ease the unstoppable discomfort of being on some type of amusement park ride from hell. Extreme nausea kicked in and everything moved at 900 miles per hour.  Little is remembered after this point, but I was told that I threw up several more times, and on one account, had to be carried off to the bathroom by my boyfriend.  I also learned that I attempted to take a 5th shot, but was tackled to the ground before succeeding.  Now those are real friends.The following morning I woke up, still buzzed.  The inner lining of my stomach felt soaked with alcohol, and I could still taste it in each burp that passed.  This induced more nausea, and I desperately searched for sustenance to absorb the excess.  For weeks afterwards I would not look at a bottle of alcohol without my stomach curdling.  I could kick myself in the ass for such irresponsibility.  I made an ass out of myself, while not taking my health into consideration.  I’m sure Chuckles didn’t get the last laugh since I puked on his couch.  If you don’t remember anything else, remember to take in moderation, be in the company of good friends, and for christ's sake, know your limits. Since I haven't yet had any drug experiences other than alcohol yet in my life, I couldn't possibly think of any greater way of helping but to give a description of my first time usage and aftereffects. Background:I'm 19 years old now, unemployed and looking for a job. I've got plans to do school next autumn for some years of study in computer games. For most part of my life I've been a shy, unsocial, and slightly nervous guy who did my homework and hated tobacco, alcohol and drugs in any aspect. When I use the phrase 'hated' I mean that I saw no point in using these things, and the users of it only prove to get silly to the rest of the world - or just disturbing and annoying. I grew up with a mother and a dad that regulary got drunk, and started arguing all the time. They sometimes fought but they never really hurt each other. You could say it mostly was a heavy duty verbal mess in our house *grin*Due to the fact that I was raised with alcohol in my home (I dont suppose that mum and dad could be classed as alcoholics, but they used it quite frequently, and when they did - hell broke loose) I got the picture of it that all it did was no-good. Everytime someone would offer me a drink, I declined the offer. I 'hated' it. Now to time around ingest:It wasn't until this spring that I began to think about using alcohol. I've been through a depressive state for about a year, circulating around how life works; defining what life really is. I won't discuss this matter here, both of reason that if you accept this belief it will probably fuck up your head, and, it would be really long and so on. Anyway - As I was accepting the idea of alcohol, I sent my brother to buy me some booze. I've tasted some liquor that my mum had bought a few weeks ago and thought that it would do, since I was 'quite' unexperienced in the field of drinks. Well, I kinda had a friend 'J' over at my place, and he acted like a babysitter even though we didn't plan it that way. Since I was unemployed, I started drinking the very sweet liquor at around noon, and my friend was cheering me to go on and sweep it all down. First off, I opened the bottle and sniffed it. Ah, a very 'sharp' smell indeed. I had a quite small glass which would hold about a regular shot, or maybe two maximum (about half size of regular water glass). I poured it up and sipped it slowly while sitting on the floor with my legs crossed. I had a slight nervous feeling since I didn't knew what was going to happen, but my general pre-belief was that you don't really get that affected, that nothing can take control of yourself. I expected to get dizzy and have altered orientation. Me and my friend 'J' started playing some poker, using cents as bets. We kept it low since we didnt have much money, but we both liked the idea to gamble for money. I started off good with a few wins, and I drank - what he thought was - quite fast. He said that I should slow down a bit. Unexperienced as I were, I didn't believe him really, since the worst thing that could happen was that I'd get sick and threw up plus disorientation. After about 10 minutes after the first drink, I noticed that I got warm and cozy, but I had an awful taste in the mouth due to the liquor's sweetness factor. Way too much sugar! I guess that I had about 4 or 6 glasses by this point. I also noticed that I could move my arms much more freely, as if someone would have oiled my limbs! I also noticed that I swayed back and forth much more easily. This was not really uncomforting, and I had a great time swinging my arms around while playing. 'J' must of thought me as an asshole =)After about 15 minutes, and two more glasses, I began to get sleepy/dreamy. Its quite hard to describe, but it felt like I could not fixate my thought or sight on one single object for some time. I started to get slightly nervous, and thought I'd sit in the sofa instead. Well, as I tried to get up from my position on the floor (I had remained in the same position the whole time til now) I noticed that I flew up like a rocket! I could move so quick, but sadly to say not to accurately. It felt like the smallest move would be accelerated and keep going in one direction and it was hard to get my limbs to be exactly where they ought to be. As I sat down on the sofa, I had a quick shot more, and I felt that it was becoming more and more hard to swallow any more. I've consumed about half the bottle, 250 ml of 32% in 15 minutes. I recall that I leaned backward on the sofa to get a comfortable position, but then I was to clear my throat - and it was here I started to panic.As I cleared my throat, and swallowed it back down it felt like the goo got stuck midway down. It could be compared to a choking feeling. It was there and I couldnt get it away. It was irritating my throat and the more I tried to get it away, the harder I had to breathe. Well, I didn't 'really' have a hard time breathing, but since I had taken so much alcohol in such short notice, my throat had gone numb and it was like a phantom feeling that I had something in my throat. I was remember thinking 'oh god, what is this shit?' After awhile, I began to realize that it was just imaginary and I kept playing with 'J' with a slight discomfort in my throat, but I had no more panic. About +20 minutes since I started drinking I felt very weird. I had a hard time concentrating on the cards laying on the floor, and I couldnt make out any winning patterns in my game. I recall that I showed him my cards when we compared, and I had a pair of knights. He had nothing. But then all of a sudden he sneaked in another king to his cards and I was very puzzled by this. How could a card turn to another?! I didn't realize that he put another card there - even though I was watching him the whole time and even saw the act. It just wouldn't compute!At +25 minutes I began to get really 'wasted' if you'd say, meaning that I somehow felt out of myself. Not like what they describe a out of body experience (oobe), but more like a sort of... Hmm, 'I'm not in control, I just watch', but I recall some vision of seeing me from above me sitting in the sofa. This was however more of some dream fragment, and should not be considered as a out of body experience. It was very dreamlike.The world felt surreal and I wanted to sleep. I finished off the whole bottle around +30m. I can't remember much of this but my friend took pictures and movie clips of me. I can see from these pictures and clips that I seemed very unaware of the surrounding area. At one, I simply looked blankly forward, and at another clip of video I was laying on the sofa, kicking and flopsying my arms around. On that clip you can also see that the picture behind the sofa is tilted. I guess I must have hit it, but I have NO memory of doing so. When I was 'animated', I mainly fell over myself all the time, not being able to stand straight. The last clip shows me just sitting there, looking into the void, the thin air if you like. On this clip you can also notice that the picture is all removed from behind me. I have absolutely no idea of how it was taken away (or how I knocked it down).I spend about 15-30 more minutes in the room and I began to feel sick. No matter how I laid down, the sickness was still there. At about +45 to +60 minutes, I sought refuge to the bathroom and spent FOUR hours puking. This was a real nightmare. I can't remember much of it, since I seem to have memory gaps of the evening. I do remember though that I felt overly sick and since I drank a lot of water from the sink, I got very very cold. At first, I puked in the sink, but I have a slight memory that I mumbled something to my mum, and she had to plum the pipe clean. At the final stages of puking, all that came forth was a yellow substance that tasted hell. Sorta acid thingey. Eventually there came nothing, but I had a noncontrollable uge to puke and it only hurt. Finally the nightmare was over, and 'J' had gone home by long time ago. It felt like I was there for 45 minutes but mum and dad (and clock) proved 4 hours. I went to bed without any problems to get to sleep (in fact, it felt very relieving) and woke up a few hours later, at 8 pm. I felt fine but had slight nausea. Nothing disturbing though, and I thought that it was a hangover. I had some food and began playing games, but then I began to start feeling sick again. Next morning:The next morning I felt fine. No headache or anything. One thing that alarmed me though was that when I went to pee, it turned out like a unclear solution with a white/yellow color. First I thought my liver had gone, then I thought I had gonorrhoea but studies proved that it was just the huge amount of sugar that gave this strange effect to my pee. This wears off in a day or so.Afterthoughts:Well, I found out that alcohol wasn't that grand at my first attempt, and I didnt realize how people would appreciate it. I told myself to never use it again, but within a month or two I was at it again. My opinion changed as I used it more, and I came to use it at a regular basis (once a week or so). I had a carve for it, its hard to explain but I feel like I need it to have fun. I've always eaten well before drinking, since this seems to aid nausea. I did once drink a lot without any food in 1 day. That day was the first one with hangover, and boy - I don't want that. Its like walking hell. My orientation is off match and I feel sick... Very sick. Also had a headache but that was the least of my worries.Additional information:I was prescribed the antidepressant drug Fluoxetine. I've used alcohol in addition to my antidepressants with no negative effects. The doctor said it was okay to drink while I was eating them, but when I now (today) happened to come across a website that described Fluoxetine, it said that one should avoid alcohol with this medication.Today, I'm a more socially open person who likes to hang out with people. I don't know if its the use of alcohol that has changed me but it has clearly loosened up my opinion about stuff. I do feel that my first experince was very bad but all I could do was to ride it out. My tip to unexperienced alcohol users is that they should not drink it with haste. Let it flow over 1-2 hours. I have been snorting heroin occasionally for about 6 months now and at this stage you could say I am still using it recreationally. It still doesn't fuck up my life despite my  difficult situation right now having graduated from university and looking for work at a time everybody else loses their job. But I am not an addictive personality. I enjoy drugs I guess I have done every single drug there is and I have never become addicted. Heroin I now realise is different and even I need quite a bit of willpower to keep it from taking up more and more room in my life. Strangely enough, I am not willing to give it up even though it's power makes me nervous. Heroin is unlike any other drug. I have a very tight circle of good friends who are quite open towards drugs and we often took drugs together but me and my boyfriend  keep our little 'dirty' passion for heroin a very private secret even with them, because we don't want to upset or worry them. We just tell them we go out in South London lately because Noth London has become boring and pretentious and not because we are going there to get some Heroin. I mean we are 25 now and regarded our drugtaking years as almost over, we were quite bored by everything else anyway but then Heroin came along. The first time I took it I was actually rather dissappointed having heard all this 'much better than sex' crap. It is not. Heroin has this strange quality of sneaking into my life like someone you meet who isn't your type at all and who you think you'd never fancy at all but then you find them hard to forget and catch yourself thinking about them all the time  and before you know you are madly in love and married to them. Heroin has something very tender and gentle to it that needs a little experience to appreciate it fully.In the beginning I felt just a strange numbness.The trap about Heroin is that I completely overestimated it before I took it, when I take it I lose my caution, drop my guard  and underestimate it because 'it isn't that good anyway'. I take it some more and suddenly find that there really is a very powerful undercurrent pulling me toward it. Other drugs make me want them in a very straightforward sexual sense, I have something like a crush on them, Heroin makes me fall in love with it and that makes it so difficult to control. I love these nights every couple of weeks when I and my boyfriend light the candles have a good glass of red wine and a couple of lines of Heroin and sit there until 4 in the morning talking, getting splendidly high and then cuddle up in bed together, going from sleep into pure bliss and back. I find that (after a couple of these nights when the bag of Heroin is finally empty and we promised ourselves to wait at least a fortnight until we go and get some again) I really crave it and it takes quite some willpower to go on with my life and get things done again. It is quite easy to say well, what the fuck I just don't give a shit the whole world makes me sick I want it here and I want it now. A couple of days ago my boyfriend said, I really don't understand how I could ever want any other drug but Heroin. And that is true I am completely cured I don't want anything else. No Coke no e's no LSD, all crap I've met someone who's different now. Heroin demands my undivided attention, it demands absolute devotion and I have to be really careful because it is powerful and it is very hard just to play with it occasionally. I hope I can keep it the way it is and enjoy it as an occasional indulgence but it does take me some willpower and control and nothing else ever demanded that much self control of me. MY DREAM After the lobby... According to my friends, I then opened a gallon of Jack Daniel's Punch and refused to share, drinking the whole thing by myself.  I only remember a snapshot of this, pouring my cup and spilling all over the table and my lap.  After drinking this, they said I just passed out on the bed asleep.  They figured I was okay and they left to check out a festival that was happening across the street. Three or four hours passed and they decided to pick me up from the room so I could enjoy the festivities.  According to them, I was still lying in the same spot on the bed.  Apparently, I seemed fine, so they told me to walk with them outside.  Keep in mind, I have no recollection of this.  I have done Datura several times before, and that this bad combo of booze and tranqs were somewhat similar, in the sense, I was out of my mind delusional.  We were walking on a trail by the lake when I got angry with them and yelled 'Fuck off' to them and started walking another way through the crowd.  They ignored me and kept on walking.  The story gets really fuzzy because no one sober was there to recollect it.  All I have to go on is the snapshot memories I had. Anyway, I walked across the lake, and my feet were very tired, I was getting frustrated and wanted to go home badly, but I didn't know where I was.  I  remember I asked this biker 'Which way is my house'. I don't remember his reply but he had to of thought that I was on something.  Next, I was on the bank of the river and I was so happy to see my brother, Klint. He told me that we could cross the lake to get home, and I remember seeing stepping stones magicaly appear on the surface of the water to walk across.  My brother was really 300 miles away, the person I saw was a hallucination that I had a long conversation with.  This is what I mean when I say it was similar to Datura.  Anyway, 3 or 4 hours passed and my friends started to look for me, one of them found me, I was barefoot in the lobby sitting on the couch talking to someone who wasn't there.  I don't know how I got back to my hotel, but I was found and brought up to my room before anything more happened.  I fell back asleep on the bed.Well, It was very dangerous, mostly because I had no idea it would do all that to me.  I have only a dozen of snapshots of that day, one of the strongest of which was me trying to stand up but I couldn't, I kept slipping and rolling all over the grass. I said to myself 'this must be a dream, I'd be arrested by now if it wasn't.' But that was mostly it.  So the moral of the story; be careful with the substances you take it could end up being very bad, or in my case almost very bad.  -SIVVY STILTSP.S. My underwear is still MIA... could've ended very bad. At the age of 22 I had been only mildly involved in recreational drugs, using cannabis at University only rarely. Newly single I was much more interested in going out and getting competely inebriated in cheap student bars. Booze and boys were my biggest vices and life in general was sweet.I invited various friends and some of my siblings to accompany me to a local comedy venue on New Years Eve 04. The night progressed and it was with anticipation that I acquired a pill from one of my house guests with the intention of taking it after the stage show had finished and a livelier and more user friendly environment found. As a novice user the only preparations that I had made for the experience was an empty stomach and two bottles of cheap house wine. However the night proved to be a good one and carried me through until new year's day where one of my friends and I decided to move proceedings on to the local pub for opening time where we downed a few vodkas to take the edge off the looming black cloud that was slowly starting to apppear above our weary heads.The next day I returned to work feeling  slightly worse for wear but functional nonetheless. I returned home ready for nothing but slumber. A phonecall from an ex boyfriend promising drinks and a night out soon put an end to that notion. We did the usual crawl of the local bars and then a group of us headed over to a small dingy venue intending to funk it up with a bit of soul and motown. There I took two tablets and did some poppers. I felt more alive that night than I have ever felt. I remember thinking that I was the most sensuous and wonderful person in the whole world and everyone else around me was looking and sounding fairly amazing too. We returned to  the flat where my ex boyfriend was staying after stopping en route to pick up some alcohol. We put on some tunes, had some drinks and I took another pill. The rest of the night and following morning was just a hazy blur of mindless nonsensical chatter. I remember waking at 11pm after being asleep for a few hours and deciding that it was a good idea to get home.I slept that night, waking often due to involuntary twitching from my aching limbs. At 9am the next morning I rose to find myself water. Upon one mouthful of it I must have retched up what must have only been  alcohol and most of my stomach lining.The next day I was due back at work. I had that looming sense of dread that had been apparent a few days earlier. However I had a surprising amount of energy even if I felt a little spacey and not quite myself. I attended work again the next day. Everything was fine until late in the afternoon. I suddenly felt the most searing pain across my brain. I felt physically sick and thought that I was going to pass out. I screamed to a colleague to call me an ambulance.I really thought I was having some sort of stroke and was dying. After a few minutes the pain subsided and I was left feeling nauseous and dizzy. I went home after deciding against going to the hospital.The days which followed this are a blur. I remember flashes of light across my eyes, even when they were closed and the feeling that everything around me was spinning. I felt completely depersonalised as if watching myself from afar. After ten days of this I decided to visit my doctor as I was worried that I had done lasting damage to myself.I have since had to move out of the flat which I share with my friends and return home to live with my parents as I cannot live independently. I cry constantly. I feel that some part of me died that night. It has left me and will never return. Exactly seven weeks on from the night it happened I write this. These feelings of unreality have not gone away. I have gone from being someone who was the life and soul of the party to a shell of a human being. I had never had any problems with depression or any psychiatric disturbances before I took ecstasy. I can't believe this is me. I now face the prospect of being on medication for the rest of my life, that's if antidepressants work for me at all because at the moment there seems to be little reprieve from the horror that I'm going through. All that I wish to say is be sensible with your dosage and don't mix with alcohol or any other substances. Millions of people take ecstasy with little or few adverse effects. The horror stories about lasting psychological problems from just one night are also few and far between. Taking ecstasy is a gamble that will pay off for most recreational users who will have the night of their lives. However I am proof that heavy use on only one single occasion can trigger something deep and sinister in a formerly happy and balanced individual. I fear that one night of hedonism has cost me a lifetime of happiness. I only hope that others do not pay the same hefty price. An old, wise friend of mine offered to share with me the byproduct of an independent lab project since I had never tried a phenethylamine of any sort.  My experiences before had been primarily with salvia d., DMT, and psilocybin.  I suppose I had high expectations of the 2c's from hearing other folks' tales.  Since I was working with a new compound, I tried it at home first, with water, a bed, a bathroom, good music, and good company close at hand--tools to help with any funk I could find myself in.  I've yet to have a freakout and would like to keep it that way!I'm hypoglycemic and have a hard time with fasting, so I took the 20mg in water as soon as I got up in the morning.  I held it sublingually for five minutes before swallowing.  In another five minutes, I was edging towards a +1, comparable to a 2-beer buzz.(T-45min) Beginnings of a mild bodyload: muscle weakness and an empty threat of nausea as the effects intensified.  No visuals and not really psychedelic, but my thoughts were slowed and dulled.  I walked out to the front porch to sit with my roommate and watch a fog bank roll in just fifty feet over our heads.  I ate some cherries, some cheese, and drank a glass of red wine after my stomach stopped worrying.  I would've been happier if I hadn't.  (t-1h) My roomate began to talk about his relationship problems.  I lent him a sympathetic ear as usual, feeling no special warmth or connection, but grateful not to have to speak.  I was beginning to have to concentrate very hard to be able to process my thoughts into comprehensible phrases.  Cognition was drunkenly stultified, though I could still push past it to functionality/ +2(t-1.5h) A few bike-tire track visual patterns briefly appeared and subside. I generally don't experience visuals on anything other than smoked DMT, though.(t-2h) My thinking suddenly cleared and all visuals have fled--feels like the peak.  (t-3h) Almost at baseline, though a little bit fuzzy and tired. No euphoric or creative afterglow.  Feel as though I may have had a minor insight, but can't really remember many details of the past few hours.Retrospective:Not a particularly interesting substance in its own right.  However, it might add novelty to an otherwise uninspiring activity.  Though very mild, the body load simply wasn't worth the initiative it sapped out of me.  I'd like either ideas or the freedom to romp about, and this compound didn't inspire either. I didn’t even intend to do drugs that day.  I had no idea, when I woke up that morning, that a visit with some close friends would turn into a nightmare by the end of the day.  A few of my friends from college were coming down to my city to hang out at the beach, where my family was staying in a vacation house for a couple weeks.  They arrived around noon, and I remember running ecstatically to greet them at their car.  It was a beautiful summer day in Southern California, and I figured we would all chill around the beach area, maybe go for a drive, have lunch, just talk and catch up.  One of my friends, however, was tempted by the thought of Mexico being so close by.  He had the idea of buying some ketamine (which is legal in Mexico) and make a huge profit selling it at raves in California.  So I agree, why not, let’s go have lunch and some drinks in Tijuana, and then come back.  Among the people present that day were several compulsive drug users.  These were the people with whom I’d experimented with acid, ecstasy, speed, cocaine (and of course marijuana and alcohol) during the past school year.  I should have realized that going to Mexico could be dangerous (especially if drugs are involved, crossing the border and such), but my judgment was definitely lacking during the course of this whole day.  Sometimes when I’m with my friends I feel invincible.So we drive down to TJ, park and walk across the border.  One of the girls goes into a pharmacy and nonchalantly asks for several vials of ketamine.   The K is put into a water bottle, diluted with water to look inconspicuous.  After a little shopping and looking around, we decide to have some margaritas before we go back.  The girls in the group got pretty tipsy, including me (I had probably a margarita and 2 corona beers … plus the waiter was oh-so-eager to offer us some tequila shots as well).  Things seemed safe, I was having fun, when the waiter offered us some pills that he said were really good with alcohol.  I had heard of people using prescription muscle relaxers and painkillers with alcohol, with pleasant effects and no problems.  So I figured that these pills he was offering us were something of that sort.  The guy with us who was the main ‘druggie’ of the group asked the waiter several questions before deciding that they were ok and that he would buy some for all of us.  Big mistake on my part: not knowing exactly what I was taking and trusting other people to approve it (when they didn’t even know what it was either), also taking any drug with alcohol.  We finally leave, a bit drunk, but still sober enough to manage.  This started to change, however, as we walked through the turnstiles to return to the U.S.  Everything looked fuzzy and I started to feel like I was losing control of my muscles.  I turned to my friend walking next to me and saw her stumbling.  We looked at each other, not able to focus on each others’ faces, and she whispered, “I feel fucked up … like, too fucked up.”  I felt the same way.  I couldn’t explain it; I had been drunk many times before and it never felt like this.  I felt like water, just flowing along, unaware of my physical motions.After that, everything that I remember is very much a blur, though I do remember basically what happened.  Somehow my friend who was driving was able to drive us to my favorite coffee shop (we got very lost getting there; this is somewhere I would go on a very regular basis).  We got to the parking lot and I realized I had the water bottle with the ketamine in it.  Being completely fucked up and stupid, I said, “I just want to see what it tastes like,” and took a little sip.  Seeing me do that, another friend grabbed the bottle, and pretty soon we had all taken at least a sip, some of us more.  After that it was all over.Apparently I hit the parking lot ground and was lying there, incoherent, for awhile (I don’t really remember this).  A few other people did the same.  Two of my friends went into the coffee shop and fell down.  The next thing I remember is a cop trying to talk to me; I could barely see him because my vision was almost all dark, I was crying but I don’t know what I was saying to him or what he was saying to me.  One of my friends said later that the cops that found us there in the parking lot were saying things to us to the effect of what disgusting stupid idiots we were.  After the parking lot scene, I have a vague, one-moment memory of being in a car again (I found out later that my friend who was the driver had called a friend of his who lived in the area, to pick us up and take us back to my parents’ vacation house).  The next thing I remember is boom—hitting the ground at the beach, and by the time I was able to move and get up, I realized that I had been lying there facedown on the sand for several hours.  I stumbled back to the house with the two girls who had been dropped off with me, and found that two people had gone home, and one was in jail.  The pills that we had taken were Rohypnol, one of the most infamous “date rape drugs,” and I can understand now how it works for that evil purpose.  We are very, very lucky that the Rohypnol didn’t really kick in until we were across the border.  I can only imagine what that waiter had intended to do.  One of my friends had pocketed the extra pills after we took them, and so he was the only one with any illegal drugs found on him, thus he went to jail for the night.  I was so freaked out, trying to figure out how to keep this from my parents and be able to get this guy out of jail at the same time.  The guilt, the regret, and the headache were unbearable.  I felt weak and shaky all day.I was able to borrow my dad’s car and get our friend out of jail after his mother paid the bail.  He seemed terrified when we picked him up.  I dropped my three friends off at the train station and that was the end of our visit, which was supposed to be a regular nice sunny day with friends at the beach.  Instead, we ingested an utterly stupid combination of alcohol, K, and Rohypnol, caused a lot of problems for one of our friends (he went to jail, had to go to court after that, is on probation, has to do community service and go to NA meetings, etc, while the rest of us are blame-free), and had a terrifying, traumatic experience.  This was about a year ago; I haven’t been to Mexico since. I am only writing from my own experience here; yours may be different.1) ---Its effects on me during the years I 'discovered' it---I first got drunk at the age of 17. I remember the afternoon well. I had finished school and was bored. I would be alone for at least a couple of hours. I stole some sherry from the cupboard and drank some.I felt 'inflated' and exhilerated. My head spun slightly, but my mind was still the same mind that I used in daily life. I had not changed; but my point of view was different. I felt relaxed and confident. I felt silly. I felt like dancing around and hugging people. And I 'recognized' the feeling somehow. The ludicrous thought that in a previous life I was an alcoholic dashed through my mind. Basically my mood was enhanced. When I looked at the bottle of sherry, I thought, 'Where have you been all my life?'I felt full of myself. I could easily picture myself in impressive situations, for instance imagining myself as lead guitarist and genius in my favourite band. It was easy to fall into silent egocentric reverie when drunk (it still is, for me, today). Alcohol was like a cross between ecstasy and cocaine. Some features of both. It is interesting that alcohol's deadening effects, similar in some ways to tranquilisers, never manifested themselves to me until many years later. When drunk, I was infused with energy and could only celebrate life. Of course, drinking too much resulted in head-spins and early nights, so to that extent I was aware that alcohol slows things down. But to that extent only. In all other respects, alcohol was a pure stimulant.I soon discovered that, when drunk, the desire for the 'new' and 'innovative' fades, and much pleasure is derived from the 'familiar'. This is no more startlingly illustrated that by music. When drunk, I wanted only to hear songs I'd heard before; I had no patience to sit through an 'unproven' clump of songs off a new album. I believe this effect of alcohol is not unusual and explains the predominance in pubs of 'oldies' at the jukebox. And it's not to say  that the power of these older, more familiar songs diminishes when drunk; to the contrary, I could see infinite emotions in my favourite tunes. It was merely a change in preference.A 'hangover' is primarily dehydration. There's little else to it. Some people react to this dehydration differently. Keeping hydrated, I can avoid feeling bad the next day.So, euphoria, light-headedness and relaxation were the effects of alcohol when I was a teenager.2) ---The change in my worldview that occurred after my first experiences---I remember the exhilerated, relieved phone call I made to my friend the first time I took alcohol: 'I'm drunk! You're never going to believe this, I'm drunk!' Sounds stupid but the meaning, which I never expressed, was more profound: 'I've realized that there's more to life! There are other states of conciousness! What does philosophy have to say about this fact? And it's a FACT! I just proved it. I know it to be true, since I am drunk myself right now. First-hand knowledge. What is the Universe?'A period in my life occurred where the 'doors opened'. I had renewed zest for life in the long term. I tried other drugs too, many with dreadful results (marijuana especially). Alcohol helped me with girls. It helped me relate to others. It improved my confidence (at times, too much). It made me into a more intersting person, to be honest.3) ---What its effects on me are now, eleven years after I first got drunk---What does alcohol do to me now? I have been through periods where I haven't touched a glass for months; I have been through periods where hardly a night passes without getting drunk. I am more aware that the 'me' that I experience when drunk is not, in fact, the 'me' that others around me experience. To some people, that would be crushing; to me it is merely interesting. A selfish guy, I suppose.More importantly, the euphoric effects of alcohol, no matter what the dose, have diminished profoundly. Whereas I could once be assured of a great time simply by virtue of drinking a bottle of champagne, I now find that the same bottle will more likely than not send me to sleep, with a depressed and anxious day to follow.I have reached a point where I simply cannot understand grown men and women who become dependent on this drug. It seems to me a useless substance whose effects on grown-ups, as opposed to alcohol-naive youngsters, is simply not worth the hangover. Not to mention that this stuff tastes terrible to me, in all its forms (beer, wine, spirits, liqueurs), no matter what people pretend! If it tasted good, people would be drunk more frequently than they are. It's nature's own bio-feedback mechanism. Keeps most of us under control. In the same way, I view the increasing likelihood of alcohol to result in a bad or indifferent experience as another 'autofeedback' situation.Absinthe restores part of the euphoria and clarity of the original experience, but that is another story.So there we go! That's what I think of the most common psychoactive substance (significantly psychoactive, I mean) that humans indulge in.Peace to you.  DOSE: \\xa0  oral Kratom (extract) \\xa0 \\xa0  oral Alcohol \\xa0[Originally posted to Shaman Australis Web Forums.  Thanks to SA and gomaos for this report.]I had to give it a shot, especially after touching alcohol again after having been off it for 6 months completely.At the beginning of December, say around the 10th, I had bought a bottle of scotch and drank it.  Nothing bad had happened, nothing depressing, life was being pretty gradual... i just was bored BECAUSE nothing ever happened.For about 4 weeks, I drank almost every day.  Perhaps twice a week, I'd drink a bottle of whiskey/day, other times a sixpack of beer a day or equivalent.On weekends with friends perhaps 2 bottles of whiskey or equivalent/day. Then I traded some kratom leaves with a friend, 25 nice and big ones, and made an extract, using water, citric acid and vinegar.I simmered until a black paste was left.I took half of that paste.Approx 4-6 hours later I felt no need to drink anymore and switched from homebrew to coffee.The next day I had the other half of the extract and stayed of the alc. I have to mention the the extract also gives you a slight tryptaminy tingle in the brain, quite pleasant and perhaps a little similar to MDMA.If the dose was upped say, four times, this would be quite spectacular. I stayed off the booze four five days and probably would have stayed off it further, but we went to the Coast stayed in a motel, and since my mate was shouting there was all this free bourbon, just too good an opportunity to say no.So I spent 2 and a half days on the grog again.Quite heavily, but my, I paid for it dearly with horrible hangovers.  On monday morning I made a second extraction of the kratom leaves, as well as adding some shiva stalks and leaves, calea leaves, my last mexican poppy leaves and some brahmi.It helped me again to stay off it for 3 days now and I think I'm gonna make until the next good opportunity comes along.Being able to control your addiction is what you really want, since you want to be able to do IT at certain times but not ALL THE TIME because that destroys your life(style).I'm now toally out of kratom, but will get some most likely in another 2 weeks...  In meanwhile I suppose me old mate san pedro and a few off his mates will have to help out.I give kratom 10 out of 10 as an ethnobotanical miracle plant. I'm a moderate to heavy drinker. A night of drinking for me will usually start around 8pm and go until close (2am). In this time period I have no problem drinking constantly while still maintaining a trace of sobriety (i.e. I can always walk, talk etc; I rarely puke or experience dissorientation). The beginning of one night several weeks ago boggled my mind. I usually don't respond well to weed - I'm a sleeper. I take a few drags on a joint and get all glazey eyed and have to make an effort to speak and interact socially. Whatever. We had been around drinking for a while when someone sparked up a joint and I thought why not join in... Half a minute later we were getting ready to go and I put on my jacket. My vision shot off into the distance and I fell to the ground. I couldn't feel my body or understand where I was or what was happening. Slowly, after and indeterminable period of time (it felt like I had briefly been outside of time) I could here voices of concern talking about me and 'me' seemed like an odd thing. Then the sensation that someone was touching me and talking directly to my face faded in. I clambered up to my feet and almost fell over - what was this? I'd just gotten started drinking and I felt like I was a teenager hammered off their first beer. I moved to a couch and collapsed. I was in an uncomfortable position but my arms wouldn't move to correct it. My face felt cold and tight and I could barely form words. I was paralyzed! All this from a couple drags on a joint?The next day when I woke up I noted a massive bloody scrape on my knee where I had fallen (luckily my arms broke my fall saving my face!) It was soaked right through to the front of my pants .. yummy!I suppose the moral is to understand how you react in a safe setting before mixing things in the wild. I can only imagine the results if a similar incident had happend at a bar, or anywhere in public for that matter. It also reaffirms my own personal suspicion.. mj and beer don't mix good at all. Zam: 15-16mg 4-methylaminorex Zara: 8-10mg 4-methylaminorexMaterial: very nice, 1-4mm long crystalsAbout 2 hours before the 4-methylaminorex, zara takes 8mg diazepam.T+30: Zara somewhat uncomfortable, wasn't sure she wanted to take the stimulant and experiences some discomfort on the way up. Zam notices coming up effects.T+1:35: Zam : Physical stimulation very noticeable, but not unpleasant.  Lips and extremities slightly buzzy.  Zara feeling pretty good, earlier discomfort gone.  Zam spends time doing some house wiring he had started before ingesting the stimulant.Zara: 'I feel good but have that 'I fell good but also feel like I'm going to come down and not feel as good in an hour' feeling.'T+1-4 hours: Zam + Zara share a bottle of a riesling (sweetish white wine).T+2 hours: Zam has very noticeable jaw tension which continues to worsen for the duration of the evening.  Snacking reduced.  Have a cracker and some anti-oxidants.Watched a movie, did some work, worked with photos and photo-printing to good effect.  Able to spend a couple of hours working on a project without the normal sense of doldrums and short-attention span that characterizes much of waking consciousness.T+4 hours: Zam 151/81 76pulse, very high for Zam.  Zara slightly raised at 94/66 72pulse.  Zam has much more noticeable increase in cardio stress than Zara.T+5-7 hours:  Better-than-average erotic push, seemed to weaken the effects of the alcohol.  T+8 hours: Both Zam and Zara fall asleep fairly quickly.  Next morning, about 5 hours after going to sleep, wake up and don't feel like sleeping anymore.  The next day Zam has residual jaw tension.  Next day, snacking inclination noticeably reduced, an abnormal feeling in the head, but not tired all day.  Stay up til past normal bedtime night after.Generally felt really good all the next day and no noticeable hangover or  negative after-effects.Overall, for a third trial of this material, very impressed.  Too bad its so uncommon.  The main thing that impresses me is how the next day feels so good and there seems to be the lack of crash.  Very smooth, slow down ride and able to sleep easily for me at T+8 hours.  At the 15mg dose range for me, this material is a light mood lift and increased ability to do some types of work.  Haven't tried doing much programming on it, it could be too euphoric for the logical concentration necessary, but for many other types of work its great.I'd say it synergized well with alcohol, if it reduced its effects somewhat.  Hard to say about the diazepam, definitely changed its effects a lot. This report is created in the hope that it reaches a few like me whom have had little luck in experiencing alternative methods of thujone injestion without the hooplah of added herbs, high-proof alcohol (could be viewed as expensive), and general stogginess that seems prolific in new wave psychedelic experimention.     As I sit sipping a glass of home made absinthe, I am left to wonder at the anal nature of prepartations and defintions of classical and current absinthe ingestion.  Somewhere in the past I was partaking in a lovely stroll through my local health food store, and noticed a jar of wormwood herb for 70 cents (Canadian) per ounce.  As pleased as I was, I wondered if I could afford the alcohol to attempt extraction.  After researching some experiences and methods of prepartion, I decided to go my own route and dose the wormwood (1 heaping teaspoon) with the trusty lemon juice bath used for other extraction purposes.  After leaving sit in a bowl with 500 mg of Vitamin C and just enough juice to cover the herb, I sat and had a lengthy discussion on the history and practice of monogamy.  After solidifying the notion that our species contains many intricate and embellished cultural trivialites, (1 hour), I strained the mixture through a cloth with lemon aid added for mass.  After experiencing the horrid taste, I knew I had to dilute with at least 750 mls of juice (not concentrated lemon juice) to be able to drink comfortably.The gist of the story is that this extraction works fine. No spoonfulls of sugar, no high proof ethanol, no added herbs.  A very pleasent buzz worthy of futher investigation.  The main benefit here is the fact that one does not have to be confused in analytical mud pits by attempting to determine the effect of the active ingredient, (thujone, supposedly) through the effect of the high proof grain alcohol.  No need for combobulation when you have not had any alcohol.Strangely enough, upon first speculation, I find the effect not uncommon to an alcoholic buzz.  This may be the culprit as to the inability of subjectively dissociating the two active ingredients.  As I take another pleasingly bitter sip from the glass, I hope that others may attempt the experience with less fuss along similar simple extraction techniques.

Here goes the story...time - 9:30 eat an ephedrine (25mg) and plan to do some homework...10:20 - decide that codeine would make electrodynamics homework a little more pleasant...prepare 300mg of codeine by cool filtration method. ..let chill11:00 = T+0  I start the clock here with the 300mg of codeine and a 25mg pill of ephedrine.

Staring to be quite a lot less productive, but my body is glowing.  I've done the ephedrine, codeine(+caffeine), and alcohol thing before, so I'm familiar with this warm buzz and I'm really digging it :-) T+ 1:10 ...can you tell I procrastinate a lot?  I have an urge for some nitrous...that would go so well with this euphoric state.  I fill a balloon with a standard 10cc nitrous charge and huff on it for a while... like a usual nirous boost I swim in vibrant psychedelia for a few seconds and drift back to a nice hummmmT+ 1:35 ...my weed smoking has dwindled the past while, but for some reason some good bud would be sweet now.  Unfortunately all I have is some dry old skunk, but it's better than nothing...  I pack a bowl of the really dry weed and figure i'l give it a bit of a push and sprinkle about 7mg of 5-MeO-DMT on top(heh).  Well I didn't get past one toke before the DMT blasted me out of this existence.  I am radiating euphoria and energy.  I become nothing but a consciousness and my whole body dissolves in a pulsing mass of the best feeling plasmic energy you've imagined.  I think of all the things that are great in my life and all the things I am so grateful for that I usually take for granted...I explore my inner self as the experience massages every single pleasure point in my brain.  I come out of the state somewhat and am feeling so energized.  The combination of drugs was fantastic, giving incredible euphoria, energy, psychedelia and ego-separation.T+1:45  it's been about 10 minutes (?) since the 5-meo hit me and a solid 30% of the DMT is still kicking...I wonder what nitrous would be like now!?!  Run and grab a charger with an excited urgency (DMT is still pushing me) and load up a balloon...WOW!  This balloon totally destroyed me.  I felt my whole body tensing and pulsing energy like I was the focal point of the universe and was being blasted with a collosal sensory force that surged and rushed through me.  As I breathe back into the balloon I wonder how long it's been since I had a breath of air...had I remembered to breathe?  I let in a big breath of air and then alternated with the balloon a few more times riding out this experience.  As I lay back I feel exhausted like I have just done a bout of exercise.  I breathe in and out deeply as my head swishes through the music...about 45 mintes have past since the DMT...whew, what a way to make codeine seem like it's lasting a WHOLE lot longer!T+2:20   I decide to lay down and listen to some music...I let the journey ride out in a nice contented psychedelic coast back to the warm undertones of body buzz that were left over from the codeine and ephedrine.  Reflect on the trip ... most probably the most intense experience I've had with drugs. whew!T+ 3:30  I type this now, still a little jittery from all the caffeine in the codeine (about 560mg) and whatever other leftovers.  I got to know these drugs before I even thought about trying this.  These doses (especially codeine, alcohol and ephedrine) I've felt out carefully and are very sensitive to overdose.  A lot of codeine with any more ephedrine than I've done tends to lead to chills, nausea and vomiting...it's not fun.  Too much alcohol and codeine can knock you right out an put into respiratory arrest (stop breathing=bad).  As for 5-MeO-DMT, well, anything that put reality through the shredder like that I think deserves some respect, ok.  Cheers,Komrade'Living in a box, all you know are its walls...          We all live in a box'      ----Machivellien Nomen           Ewige Blumenkraft, meine freunde! This started out as a small story about ketamine, but giving it a bit of background for context made it more about roles that both alcohol and ketamine have played in my life. My parents visited me for xmas when I was 30. I had reached the point in my relationship with them where I was tired of their cruelty but I wasn’t quite over seeking their approval. So I endured their visit. We spent part of an evening drinking glasses of wine, with me listening to my dad’s same old story of how disappointed he is in me and how I’ve wasted my life and am practically destitute and on the streets. (I am very happy and well-adjusted, thank you, I’m just a bit of a freak compared to his growing-up-during-WWII ways.) Battling with my demons, loosened up by the alcohol, I crumpled into pain and tears. Nothing new here.The next few days, I systematically drank my way through the alcohol that was left over from the xmas party I’d held at my house that week. I was flagellating myself with booze, enmeshed in my dad’s trip, trying to resolve my feelings by smearing them into a messy pile. It was pointless. I had learned it from him at home, before I was even old enough to discern what “hitting the bottle” was. I dove into a good novel, and swam around in the morass of bad feelings.The morning when I was to return to work, I broke down and called my best friend, to tell her about how my xmas had gone terribly wrong. She instantly knew what was up. As I blubbered on the phone to her, I poured myself glasses of white wine, even though it was still morning. Then I poured myself shots of liquor. This was pretty much out of character. I was a well-respected professional working in a drug education-related field at the time. I apparently had decided on some level to work out some self-abuse karma with the help of a cheap and legal intoxicant. As soon as I got off the phone I fell in a swoon on the bed. I got up periodically over the next five hours to throw up in the toilet. I was trying to “get it all out,” all the bad feelings that I’d swallowed for so long, that I didn’t know what to do with. On the surface this seems like nonsense now, but my actions had a delicate logic all their own; in the privacy of my own apartment, I could enact any drama I wanted. Growing up in a household that frowned on emotional outbursts of any kind, I had never learned how to properly manage my feelings. It was like not learning the alphabet. People can go through life pretty much hiding that they’re illiterate; I was going through life hiding that I didn’t know the first thing about normal human emotions (well, hiding it from most people). And I was bursting at the seams.I made it to work the next day, with a wicked hangover, feeling sluggish and dull. Some time during the day the thought hit me, “I have some ketamine. I’ll do some ketamine tonight.”I went home and felt the first shred of hope and productivity that I had felt in a week. I peeled vegetables and made a yummy soup for myself, and cleaned my kitchen and the rest of the apartment. (I try to get all my affairs in order before every intentional experience with a psychoactive.) Then I got out my fat headphones, my down comforter, my fluffy pillows, and a mix CD a friend had made me for doing ketamine, which included stuff from K&D sessions (I still don’t know the exact playlist, which is really a shame). Now, about 48 hours after the beginning of the most severe part of the drinking binge, I insufflated roughly 50 mg of ketamine and lay back in the dark, with the headphones on, snuggled under my comforter. I let myself be carried gently into a place where I was floating free from all my messy emotions, a place where I gathered perspective on them with gentleness and compassion for myself. Shadowy visuals that moved slowly in seemingly pre-arranged patterns like a conveyor belt in a giant factory accompanied the rearranging of my mental and emotional building blocks. I don’t feel an anthropomorphic presence while on ketamine, I feel like a part of a giant machine that is also a giant space that is both benevolent and removed from human experiences. It’s a place I can go to help “reset my clock.” I feel that other psychedelic experiences have “reset my clock” before, too, but low doses of ketamine have done it in a way that I don’t have to struggle to “get”. They’re predictable, and they’re not difficult at all to integrate, and fit into my normal schedule. The music was like the water of a warm bath, the ketamine was the soothing bath salt. I came out refreshed, renewed, and grateful for a tool to help me face my own demons with compassion and objectivity.I’ve experienced this antidepressant effect of ketamine before, while in the throes of hormone-mediated melancholy and frustration that I sometimes get in the middle of my menstrual cycle. I prefer to space my ketamine experiences far apart, and regard them as special sessions to treat with reverence. Otherwise they’re just a way to get fucked up, like alcohol with a weird twist. And I don’t find it as fun to get fucked as I used to. I guess “getting fucked up” is part of an old unhappy unhealthy pattern, like at the beginning of this story. And my little doses of ketamine are like an antidote. I have used Vasopressin on occasion to see if it will enhance 'clarity of thought'.  It definitely has some effects, but I have found thought clarity staying the same or decreasing.  However, memories seem to be easier to retain, which is great if I need to learn a bunch of facts, fast.Anyway, I took 4 puffs of Vasopressin last night - to see if it would motivate me or increase my organization while packing for a move.  I got a lot done, and was feeling generally good, and so I thought - what the heck, I haven't had a drink of alcohol for over 2 months, might as well relax.So at T+2h after taking the Vasopressin, I ingested (slowly) some port with some vodka - probably about 2-3 shots-worth in all.  I was feeling very tipsy, which is unusual after 2 drinks, but surprisingly clear-minded.  The stomach feeling was a bit uncomfortable, and I was in an unfamiliar mindspace.  A certain discomfort and inner tension, much like 'coming up' on a tryptamine or phenethylamine was present.  My blood pressure was slightly elevated.  It was then that I realized I was drinking lots of water - I had about 4 full glasses, which I always do when I drink alcohol, to ensure no hangover and fewer negative effects.  So, I had consumed about 2 glasses of port/vodka and 4 glasses of water, yet I had no urge to pee -- I couldn't pee, my bladder was empty.  Suddenly it struck me that it was NOT wise to drink so many liquids while taking Vasopressin - an anti-dieuretic.  I couldn't sleep for a good 3 hours due to discomfort and a strange headache, and when I finally fell asleep and woke up this morning, I still didn't have to pee.  It wasn't until about 12 hours later from taking the Vasopressin that I was finally able to pee and get some liquid (and processed alcohol, perhaps?) out of my system.  I still feel slightly inebriated (which is crazy!) but I'm feeling much better now.  I can't imagine having all those liquids in me all night, not going anywhere.I have a slight headache this morning, and I will take the warnings about Vasopressin being an anti-dieuretic (and not drinking too much) more seriously next time. It is currently 8:49; four minutes ago I drank a tea made out of 5 grams of Blue Lilly. Ten minutes prior to drinking the tea I had smoked a bowl of the dried Lilly flowers. The effects of the Lilly come on fast after smoking the flowers. A mild euphoria and sedation similar to opium but much more mild are present. However, I am not sleepy just feeling lazy and without motivation to move.Unlike opium there is a strong degree of sensory enhancement similar to MDMA. Unlike MDMA however there are no empathic feeling present during the intoxication. Smoking the flowers makes the effects come on quicker and stronger than the tea however the effects of the tea last longer. I would like to put some music on however I have to force myself to do so.I finally manage to beat the inertia and put on a CD by Dead can Dance. The music sounds wonderful. The sound is different but hard to describe, more 'whole' sounding. I think now would be a good time for a glass of wine. Alcohol seems to have a special synergy with the Blue Lilly. Alcohol and Lilly in combination seem to have more empathogenic effects than either taken alone. After drinking alcohol the effects change from an opiate like intoxication to a sedated MDMA-like euphoria. The drunkenness produced by alcohol is also increased by the Lilly. The over-all effect of this combination is a narcotic empathogenic experience. Taking the Lilly by itself has a definite, beneficial effect on meditation from my previous experiences. The effects of the Lilly in conjunction with alcohol however are much more conductive to talking and discussing ideas than meditation. This makes the Lilly an extremely versatile plant for use during magical rites. If one is doing a ritual alone then they could take the Lotus without mixing it with anything, increasing their focus on the ritual at hand. If a group ritual is being performed taking Lilly and alcohol simultaneously could increase the synergy of the groups members. It is hard for me to keep the paragraphs of this report flowing and on track. My mind keeps jumping around if I try to focus too much. Although, I find it easy to silence my mind by using simple meditation techniques. I am going to get up to get a glass of wine. The wine tastes much better tonight than it does while sober. The flavor of food is also increased but I have lost my appetite completely. Lilly decreases my appetite even after smoking marijuana. Marijuana and Blue Lilly have relatively little synergy other than that however. Even though I normally prefer marijuana to alcohol, while on the Lilly alcohol is far superior. I can feel my thoughts slowing as the effects of the wine mingle with the Lilly's intoxication. My brain is drifting. Other substances that combine well with the Lilly include 4-methyl-GHB and Valium, which provide a similar intoxication to the alcohol - Lilly combination. I have experienced closed eye patterning after taking the Lilly with 4-methyl-GHB, but otherwise Lilly does not cause visions when taken alone. Lilly can also be beneficial during a mushroom or LSD trip to ease anxiety. MDMA covers most of the effects of the Lilly and has little extra benefit if taken at the same time. I have considered smoking Blue Lilly at the tail end of an MDMA experience to see if it would bring back the effects of the MDMA, I have not done this yet though. Nitrous Oxide is definitely potentiated by the Lilly and it is much easier to bring back insights from the nitrous realm if you are already under the effects of the Lilly.My sense of time is highly distorted, it seems as though time is moving at about 1/4 speed. I barely realized that an hour had passed. It seemed like just a few minutes. The intoxication provided by the Lilly and alcohol in now very MDMA-like. I have experienced a deep bonding to a friend of mine on this combination before. He could barely tell the difference between the intoxication provided by the combination and the intoxication provided by alcohol alone. However he had never done MDMA, which does itself bare a striking similarity to alcohol intoxication. That night he ended up giving me a ring (which has a small band which spins around the center so you can play with it if you are anxious or worried), which an ex-girlfriend of his had given him because I was going through a bunch of stuff at that time, and he said I needed it more than he did. The ring and the night I shared with my friend have become very special to me.It is now ten o'clock and I am getting bored with writing and am thinking about heading off to sleep. Even though the Lilly intoxication will still be going strong for another couple of hours, I have had a long day and need my sleep. I hope you have all enjoyed this experience report and found it informative. It was about 2PM on a Saturday when I recieved a message from my friend that he had my morphine (he had just got a new supply), he was going to give me 60mg for some computer favours i had done him a couple weeks prior.  I'd done it once before from pills he gave me and was eagerly looking forward to this time.  So I went over to his house and picked up the pills; 6 of them, 10mg each, quick acting.  That evening, I decided it was time to take the pills.  The original plan was to crush and snort 3 of them, and tkae the other three orally, but upon trying to crush them, they were much to hard to crush, so i just took them all orally.Immediately after ingesting them I felt a little bit of a wave of relaxation, after about 5 minutes I had become increasingly spaced out, so i moved to the couch and lay there watching TV for an hour.  After an hour, things were relaxed, but not the 'great' feeling that i remembered, i felt flashes of it, but nothing groundbreaking, i just felt really spaced out.So I decided to message the friend who gave me the morph and told him about how I couldn't snort the pills he gave me, and I asked him if he would snort me a line of MSContin, another brand morphine pill that he had which could be crushed easier, he said that it would be no problem.  So I went over to his house and he had almost prepared the lines of MSContin.  He rolled up a $20 bill and we proceeded to snort through it, it was very very easy to snort, no odd sensation at all.After about 5 seconds after each line the effect could be felt.  At this point the goodness that I had felt on previous trips had returned, absolutely everything seemed marvelous.  My only worry was driving home in my doped up state.  We then went upstairs and smoked some pot, my friend was reluctant to smoke pot, because he had a karate test the next day, but it didn't take much to convince him.After the pot, things got even more mellow, the goodness of the morphine had a new depth after smoking it, it was now more a resonanting force that was swelling through my body rather than a mood, the physical aspect of the morph was multiplied many times by the pot, I felt waves of it running through my legs, and then crawling up the rest of my body to my arms.After a while I decided it was time to go home, because i told my father I was only going to be gone for a little while.  So I hopped in my car and was on my way home, I decided to stop at a gas station and get some snacks, I bought a packaged milkshake and a bag of chips.  Upon arriving home, my father had set up the slide projector, he wanted to show me pictures of my childhood, normally this would have sounded like a ridiculous idea, but on morph, it sounded great, my dad offered me some whiskey, so i mixed it with my milkshake and drank it as we watched the slides.I was having such a great time looking at all the slides, it was like everything was perfect, not a care in the world, but i was still able to function completely normally, the whiskey made me feel even more sedated, in a very good way.  After watching reel after reel (I honestly didn't want it to stop) of slides, my dad informed me that he was out of slides to show me.  So i went upstairs and watched some TV until there was nothing left on to watch, and then I surrendered to sleep. Overall, it made a great night, morphine is certainally a good drug if you want to have a genuinely good sentimental time ONCE IN A WHILE.  Mixing it with pot and a touch of booze certainally adds to the experience, I don't think I'll have any access to any morph in the near future, so this experience will be well cherished. Saturday October 20, 2001Material: 2C-I measured by mixing 96mg of 2C-I powder in 24ml of water, resulting in 4mg per 1 ml. The material was mixed first in distilled water in June 2001, over 4 months prior.  The water appeard perfectly clear with no sign of degradation or oxidation.  2C-B similarly stored has lasted years with no apparent loss in potency.  Material was from a known, reliable source of underground chemicals.Mindset: Zam: I'd been in cycles of depressive funk since the WTC attack on September 11th and was having trouble finding motivation and interest in work.  A friend had mentioned a previous weekend's recreation with 2C-B and something about that hit home and I wanted to try to shove myself out of my rut with some sort of crowbar.  I considered mushrooms, lsd, etc and wasn't sure how to pick.  In talking with Zara, she was interested in trying 2C-I and so was I and that sealed it.  We'd heard a number of people talk about their experiences, some very glowing, and some saying that they thought it had a higher body load than the brominated version.  A couple who had tried it first in a semi-therapeutic setting had said they didn't like it 'as much' as 2C-B, but I am all too aware of how much experience can vary from exposure to exposure and individual to individual to put too much weight on any of the vague comments.  Generally the agreement seems to be building that the duration is somewhat longer, but thats not necessarily a bad thing.  Dosage observations seem to be similar to 2C-B with many people saying its 'more potent' by some degree, but again dosage comments are not terribly reliable.  Folks who work with 2C-B just a few times often report wildly disparate dosages, but generally over time they settle out to more consistent readings as people get used to the normal variation in effects.So, going into this, we were hoping for some downtime to reconnect, talk about life and the world and just take some time off.  One of the recurring incredible things is how much taking a psychedelic or strong psychoactive can really create a space or a break between weeks or periods or work-mind where just excercise or movies or other types of recreation don't seem to. 8pm: Zam & Zara each have eaten nothing all day, now have 2 pieces of bread and 2 pieces of cheddar cheese.10:05pm : Zam & Zara each have a glass of wine as a way to smooth the coming up phase, which both find uncomfortable.10:21 pm: Zam 18mg 2C-I, Zara 10mg 2C-I in water solution, taken with a small amount of orange juice. The flavor is tolerable and seems to go pretty well with oj.10:40pm: Begin watching The Princess Bride as a way to ease the transition.11:00pm: Distinct effects begin, some visual changes, body feeling, light perspiration and alterations between hot and cold feelings.  Generally uncomfortable stomach and body feeling.11:40pm: Buzzing muscles and body, generally feeling stimulated and odd.  Discuss with Zara the different strange sensations.  Definitely altered.  Zara describes as feeling a sort of disequilibrium. Pee, drink a little more wine.  Zara has distinct mucus-draining in her throat causing her to cough (a normal reaction for her on 2C-B), so 25mg of pseudoephedrine is added for her (again a normal part of her 2C-B experience).12:01am: Zara notices that Zam's forehead has a vein poking out, which is somewhat normal while tripping and we discuss whether it could be blood pressure related.  We break out the wrist BP cuff, which we've been using for a few months, and try it out.  Zam's resting BP is usually 90-100 / 60-70 with pulse of 50-60.  Tonight the cuff reads 136/89 pulse 70 & 141/88 pulse 71, which are both very high for Zam with no exertion.  Zara's resting BP is normally 90/60 with pulse 60-75.  Tonight it was 116/86 pulse 74 & 119/82 pulse 69.Zara's coughing reduced to a very minor issue.~12:15am: Zam continues to get worse sour stomach feelings, I take one extra strength tums and this helps within a couple minutes.  Somewhere in this time period Zara reports that she is through the peak & coming up phase and has settled into the more pleasant effects.  Zam is still in the peak, but coming up is mostly over, muscle buzzing has settled in and general disquiet is over.12:35: Princess Bride over.  More BP measurements.  Zam 147/87 p 73 & 138/79 p 73, Zara 96/68 p 62, 101/70 p 71.  Zam's BP still quite high, not worrisome at all, but quite noticeable.  Zara's BP is a little high but pulse is on the low side of normal.At this point we re-evaluate the level of effects.  There are distinct but mild visuals, slow shifting and a little patterning.  Looking at the movie it was hard to tell if something was standing still. Continued 'body noise', muscle tension and buzzing, but not bad.  Small, pleasant starring around lights. We have tea candles lit around the edges of the room.2:00am : Zara bp 93/64 p 633am: Zam 164/90 p 80, 153/85 p 96, 149/75 p 83.  Still quite high, still not worried about it, but definitely this is very much on the high side considering my normal resting bp is so low.  Zara 104/75 p 61, 94/65 p 58.  Slightly high normal bp.  Zara appears to have come down somewhat faster than Zam.  Residual jaw tension still quite present.4am: still going, definitely down significantly from the main plateau but not completely. Cook dinner / snack of a light japanese broth with fresh mushrooms and green onions.  Follow up with Cookies and soymilk as Crouching Tiger ends.5:30am: 1mg xanax for Zam, .5mg xanax for Zara.  Asleep before 6:30am.  I am pretty sure I would not have gotten to sleep without the xanax.  Zara would probably have been fine, but the effects were not fully subsided.T+3 days (as I write this): Zam BP: 124/54 p 56 & 128/64 p 54 - Zara 84/57 p 63 & 92/58 p 61Those are all the notes I have from the evening, but after the Princess Bride got over, we spent a long time talking about the world, the net, drug information websites, terrorist attacks, with a generally upbeat tone.  The conversation was lively and we drank a little over half the bottle of a mediocre-minus pinot through the evening.  After a while (perhaps half an hour) we decided to throw in another movie as a way to stimulate further conversation.  I put in 2001, a movie I hadnt seen in over 10 years and had only vague memories of.  The pace was slow, but tolerable, but one distracting element is that the DVD recording quality on the version we watched was awful.  Something I learned is that not all DVD's are encoded the same and one has to be careful with these things that you get the Right Version otherwise you're stuck looking at really ugly digitization errors and jpeg-ing artifacts.  The black space with sunlight coming through it in the movie looked like a bad web image with jagged bands around dark objects or light objects on dark fields.  Yuck.  The 2C-I made it initially difficult to determine if it was a strange visual effect or if it was actually on the screen (which was initially hard to believe).  After some experimentation it was clear that it was actually the movie. I later read a review that said that this (the first) release of 2001 on DVD was 'horrible' and 'must be avoided'.  Oh well.As we headed into the part of the story with HAL, we decided to save the more difficult part for some other time and then watched Crouching Tigger instead.  Throughout both movies the 2C-I definitely provided a long, generous platform of mental stimulation that added to my mood and made the movies and conversation more fun.  I felt mildly intoxicated, not super 'clear' throughout the experience, but associations ran more freely and I felt like my language and communication centers were opened up a little.The overall effects level was pleasant and in the low end of medium for me: visuals starting but not really overwhelming anything, mental shifts but not huge ones, could act straight if required, wouldn't want to drive (but could).  Probably equivalent of 2 good beers for me that had a 5 hour plateau.  I really quite enjoyed the effects, as I have 2C-B.  I've done more 2C-B than any other psychedelic-class psychoactive and this 2C-I definitely was difficult to tell apart from the 2C-B that I've had before except that it seemed distinctly longer.  Normally with 2C-B at T+4 hours I'm noticing the plateau waning.  With this experience, the plateau started between 90 and 120 minutes and lasted to T+5.5 or so, so thats about a solid 3 hour plateau and then a couple hour ramp down to T+7 or so.  A single experience is certainly far from enough to make reliable generalizations, but this seems longer than my previous 2C-B experiences unless I redose.  The Day After: I slept quite a long time after going to sleep late, but my recent normal sleep schedule has been 4am to sleep, wake up 11am or so.  We slept til late afternoon, then got up and did a little work and played some computer games.  We watched the rest of 2001 (god what an awful and disjointed end, did they lose some footage?), had a hearty dinner of brown rice and stir fry, watched some tv and went to bed early (1am or so).  Generally felt drained, but not in a bad way, and tired.  Little to no motivation.  Had a little wine before bed.  In a positive, but tired, mood.2 Days After: I woke up after a normal sleeping period and found myself feeling well rested and recharged. Amount Ingested at 10-minute intervals over a 30-minute period:2 shots Jack Daniels Whiskey. 1 1/2 glasses of white wine. 030 minutes-- Feeling of happiness, an overall feeling of life is good. An urge to do random things such as watching a favorite movie. Deeper thought, my thoughts are -- how shall I say -- more emotional. I think of loved ones and my emotions are magnified about 5 times. Easier to be happy or easier to be sad, whichever one I am feeling. A feeling of warmth in my chest and my belly. Full of love and more relaxed physically, mentally, and emotionally. Every time I breathe it's like breathing a sigh of relief, a sigh that symbolizes contentment and enjoyment. All problems feel like yesterday's news. 040 minutes-- Just checked my face for physical effects. Most noticeable effect is shiny eyes. Face is slightly more red. 050 minutes-- More internal effects. Increased confidence, inhibitions are lowering, sense of well-being and contentment is continuing. 060 minutes-- Effects beginning to wear off. I will now ingest some more alcohol to continue the experiment. The amounts will be listed. 065 minutes-- Ingested immediately one after the other: 2 shot Jack Daniels whiskey, 1/2 glass of wine, 1/2 glass of water to avoid any dehydration because of the alcohol.065 minutes-- As soon as the shot of Jack was ingested the feelings of contentment and happiness continued almost immediately. This may be a psychological response as I have had experience with alcohol before. Strange effect is that in my mind, I remember moments when I was a child and I was viewing people who were intoxicated. It is as if now I realize what I was viewing as a child. I finally 'understand' their intoxication and why they did it. An identification with all alcohol drinkers in history. Motor skills beginning to deteriorate and a slight feeling of tiredness. I will now lay down and continue writing the experience in a little while. 090 minutes-- Time seems to go by faster than when in normal consciousness. What was really 25 minutes seemed to me like 5 minutes. The wonderful feelings of contentment and happiness are continuing now to a high degree. My mind seems more clear and I am remembering a dream that I had last night. I can seriously describe this feeling as euphoria, I am wishing that this bliss will never end, however I know in my mind that it cannot continue. I am now remembering childhood memories long forgotten. 105 minutes-- Feelings of happiness still here, however fading quickly. My thoughts are more charged with emotion. I had the urge to look through a family photo album and did for a while. Time dilation continuing. What is in reality 15 minutes seems like 5 minutes. Effects beginning to wear off. 120 minutes-- Effects almost totally wearing off, however motor skill deterioration still remains to a slight degree. A feeling of slight regret for drinking is occurring within me. One thing that I would like to state is that the effects of alcohol creep up on you. You realize the emotional and internal feelings however you do not realize your motor skills are deficient until you knock something over. Anyway my experiment is done and I will now write a few sentences in retrospect. I believe that alcohol CAN be an escape IF you use it wisely. It can help you if you use it with that intent. However always remember that in the end you will have to face the real world and that NO DRUG can help you do that. Have fun and drink responsibly. This is my first report on the use of modafinil and unfortunately on my first occasion of use, I did not use it in a productive and safe way as I mixed it with a heavy alcohol intake.Having got back from work I found that my anxiously awaited package of modafinil from Hong Kong had finally arrived. Rather than cracking into it straight away, I visited the local pub and drank several pints of premium cider. I then continued to drink – quite heavily – at home. All in all I must have drunk around 15 to 25 units of alcohol within a fairly short space of time and so I was pretty damn wasted. By around 2am I decided (in a rather epically stupid frame of mind) to sample one 200mg tablet of Modalert, which was followed by another 100mg half tablet around 20 minutes later. I do not recall noticing any significant effects, in fact my drunken state of inebriation probably masked any of the very subtle feeling that modafinil evokes. All I recall of this evening was a fairly happy frame of mind and also overly confident discussions with friends on facebook. After getting to sleep around 5am, I woke up an hour later to head to work. Here’s where things start to get interesting but potentially damaging! Having had one hours very poor quality alcohol influenced sleep I woke up surprisingly refreshed – actually I don’t recall ANY feeling of tiredness whatsoever. This is of course, why I purchased modafinil. I managed to get to work over half an hour early at the same time feeling slightly elated and happy. I found myself talking to colleagues more affably and any feelings of social anxiety that would otherwise have stifled the rather spontaneous and lucid conversations I was having were completely absent. My job consists of discussing financial matters over the telephone, which is surprisingly easy when my articulation and concentration are enhanced by a wonder drug. I found myself having excellent rapport conversations and explaining sometimes difficult financial topics came easy as words simply rolled off my tongue. I found that I was more organised and could multi-task easily. It is quite common at work to multitask very frequently as I might be writing notes or filling out forms while talking at the same time, my working memory in this respect was far more efficient. After a couple of hours of work however the previous evening seemed to take its toll. My temperature seemed to rise and I felt slightly sick and uncomfortable. I booked the rest of the day off as a holiday and left for home where I promptly crashed out. The increased temperature appeared to be the most worrying aspect of this experience so in future I will take just one 100mg or 200mg dose and NOT mix it with alcohol. So far I have identified two potentially beneficial uses for this drug in my case. 1. Modafinil offers me the opportunity to get more hours out of my day and to achieve far more in those hours thanks to its cognitive enhancing attributes. It has few if any severe side effects and when used infrequently and carefully, I can’t imagine it would have any adverse health impact. I do not foresee myself in future using this drug to have 2 – 4 hours of sleep each day for weeks on end but can imagine using modafinil on the night before an exam or a sleepless night before a long arduous day at work. In respect of the work, productivity and ‘wakefulness promoting effects’ I found Modafinil does exactly what it says on the tin and its physical effects are almost un-noticeable. There is no UP or buzz with modafinil, its simply a sharp frame of mind accompanied by a lack of any feelings of sleepiness whatsoever. In future I plan to use a low 100mg dose just prior to studying purely for focus and concentration purposes. I will aim to keep a normal sleep cycle in check and subsequently will not be using this drug for its effects on sleep. 2. Modafinil makes me feel ever so slightly happier but more importantly it seems to limit feelings of social anxiety, which could prove incredibly useful for me in the future in limiting or cutting alcohol use. I have identified that the sole reason I appear to drink, other than occasionally to relax or cope with stress, is to drown out feelings of social anxiety. I can often find myself becoming quiet in the company of people I am not fully acquainted with and this can make me appear awkward or strange at the best of times. This shyness is especially irritating when I join new organisations, as any feeling of ease and lucidity around new people (aka strangers, scary strangers!) is hard to come by and hard won. Modafinil seems to kill off these feelings and a shy demeanour seems to be replaced by confidence, mental clarity and a positive mood. I can imagine this may be a great and far safer alternative to drinking heavy amounts of alcohol to socialise freely and make new friends. First of I would like to say neither I nor my friend were experienced drinkers and didn't know how much we could handle, this turned out to be a huge mistake. It was New Year's Eve and me and my friend decided to score  a 40 ounce bottle of Smirnoff Twist for later that night. I also had about 24 ounces of Bacardi 151 we took from our parents. After I arrived at his house we waited until his parents went to sleep and started to drink. It was about 11 o' clock and we decided to mix it with orange juice. This is probably my 3rd time drinking This is probably my 3rd time drinking and his 2nd or 3rd too. I put about 5-6 ounces in a glass and chugged it down relatively quickly. After having a slight buzz I started my 2nd glass with about 2 ounces. Soon after that I began freaking out because his mom's boyfriend is extremely built and I thought he was going to find me and kill me. From what my friend told me because I have no recollection past this point, I started to drink swigs straight from the bottle. I started banging my head off the wall and making a lot of noise. My friend finally calmed me down and popped in the movie Anchorman. I couldn't focus or see straight. Last thing I remember is waking up puking all over his room. I then passed out in my puke. Last thing I remember is waking up puking all over his room. I then passed out in my puke.Apparently I was only sleeping for 15 minutes. I though it was hours. He woke me up screaming telling me to go to the bathroom. All this woke his mom's boyfriend who understood and told me to throw up as much as I can.  I think I threw up 3 more times in the toilet while my friend and his mom's boyfriend 'E' cleaned up my mess. I went to lay down on the couch but when I closed my eyes I felt like I was on a rollercoaster and had to go to the bathroom again. Next thing I remember is waking up at 6 in the morning. I was terribly hungover and his mom had to get carpet cleaner. She found out later that morning. Once I woke up around 12 I called to apologize for the mess and she understood and thought it was mature of me to call her. She told me she wasn't going to tell my parents if I promised never to drink at her house again. I've kept this promise for almost a year and will never break it. I've also regained my trust with their family and me and my friend learned about tolerances that night. Some psychologial effects spawned from that night though, I can't even look at vodka now without becoming sick. That was my worst experience ever and hope nothing like it ever happens again. I had been clean for almost thirty days, when I headed to my brother's house after a day of golf.  Before that night I had been going to NA meetings and enjoying my new life. My last days before I got clean were filled with endless cases of beer and enough coke to drive me to the edge of suicide.I felt fairly secure in my ability to say NO to my drugs of choice, (cocaine, alcohol, reefer) and was very sure that I would not indulge in either.Before reaching my brother's house I made a fatal mistake, I passed one of my old using buddies and invited him to our game of cards.  I was sure that even if he had a kilo of coke there was no way I going to take any.  Besides, I had a drug test for a good job just two days later.My brother knows I'm in recovery and wouldn't allow me to use anything.  But my addiction can manipulate anyone and eventually I convinced him to give me a beer. I felt comfortable that I would be okay with just one. My using buddy was obviously on coke but I had no to desire to use any.Later that night I noticed my buddy trying to get my attention without my brother noticing.  In a side conversation he let me know that he had aquired some valiums earlier that day.  I said no and watched them go to the back room to get high.  After seeing this a few times I finally gave in. I told him to put ONE in my change box for later.  He said he dropped TWO for me.  When they returned from the back room again I told him I had taken them which was a lie. I lied so I could feel a part of the group. It was a futile attempt to save my quickly fleeting recovery. When they returned from the back room again I told him I had taken them which was a lie. I lied so I could feel a part of the group. It was a futile attempt to save my quickly fleeting recovery.  Eventually I decided what the fuck and I chewed them to make sure that they hit me hard and fast.  At first I was okay and told myself that I could lie to everyone and continue to stay clean.  But when the drugs hit me my addiction took over. I told my buddy I needed another one because I wasn't feeling it. This was definitely a lie beacuse after about six beers mixed with two chewed 10mg valiums I could feel it.  So I got another and then another and then one more.  He told me I had taken all his pills but I still wanted more. At this point I had taken 5 10mg valiums and drank about 6 or more beers.   By this time I was completely gone, the rest of the story was told to me by my brother, girlfriend and mom. My brother told me that at that point that I told him I was going home.  My using buddy invited me to a party, my brother concerned for my safety said no I couldn't go with him. He couldn't figure out why I was acting so weird after drinking only a few beers. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]I remember fighting him for a while to get to my truck and he said he finally let me go and I fell down five stairs onto my face.  Somehow I made it to my truck and managed to drive 15 mins. back to my house which I have no memory of.  My girlfriend told me she heard me pull up to the house and was wondering why I was sitting in the truck so long.  Apparently I blacked out, and then came to.     I stumbled to the door and fell through it with my girl screaming that I was drunk and she told me that I was swearing I wasn't.  She called my mother thinking that I was going to hurt her and she said she was on her way along with my brother.  At this point she said I was so mad that I picked up the christmas tree and threw it across the room.  After more yelling I got even worse and start jumping on the tree and crushing all the decorations.   Finally, I said fuck you, I hate you, and I'm leaving and headed for the back door.  She told me that she ran out the front door and got my keys out of my truck and came back in just as I was falling out the back door.  Apparently I made it to the truck and blacked out again.  A little later I found myself on the living room floor with my whole family standing around me.  And I was out again.  They didn't know whether to call the cops or the hospital.  A little later I found myself on the living room floor with my whole family standing around me.  And I was out again.  They didn't know whether to call the cops or the hospital.  Lucky for me they did neither.   The first thing I remember is getting up in the morning with my girlfriend and walking in the living in total shock.  I asked what the fuck happened to the christmas tree??? She told me to come back to bed and we could talk about it later.   The next day I was so upset, she told me that last night you were screaming and looking for your gun to kill yourself. And I had destroyed the tree and said some really fucked up things. I realize now that if I would have found my gun I could have really hurt someone and I would have had to live with that for the rest of my life.   It's been two days since this happened and it is a miracle that I'm alive.  I realize that I AM A ADDICT and like they say ONE IS TOO MANY A THOUSAND IS NEVER ENOUGH.  I hope that I never have to use drugs again.  The truth is that I make the choice to pick up and god willing I never will again.  The next day after this experience I prayed with all my heart that god would let me die before I use again.  Drugs as much as I love them, enslave me and destroy my life and I hope that any addict that suffers will know that there is a better way of life. It all started pretty normally, an average christmas at my uncle's house, family around getting pretty drunk, including me. I probably drank 4 or 5 beers and 5 or 6 glasses of red and white wine over dinner. During this time I asked my uncle if he was coming for a cigarette he said that he would wait until after dinner and probably smoke a fat spliff instead. So I waited for him to skin up, in the end I had to do it myself in his bathroom. I rolled 2 pretty average sized joints and we went out to smoke them. After I had had a few tokes my head felt ready to explode, but I stupidly ignored this and continued to chuff away at the next joint. When we returned into the house I felt pretty stoned but nothing out of the ordinary, however after about 10 minutes I felt really fucked up and at this point pretty much lost all contact with reality and decided to go to sleep in the sitting room. While sitting there I began to feel really nauseated so I decided to go puke up in the toilet, I proceeded to puke violently for 10 minutes. I looked around the room and I realized that I was in a seriously bad state, I had fat red eye, I was shaking and my heart was going at 130 bpm. Worst of all I knew that I had to travel across London in about 40 minutes, so I went downstairs an sat under a cover for half an hour, during this time I felt like I was physically disintegrating and my brain seemed to be smashing around my head. After this time I suddenly felt fine and started to have detailed and articulate conversations with all of my family, which is almost unheard of when I'm stoned. This whole experience really shocked me.I am a regular user of many drugs and have done some very dangerous combos before, e.g.Valium, alcohol and cannabis, all in high doses, and have never really been sick before, then to get really fucked up off just one joint really scares me, it makes me see how incredibly powerful cannabis can be. So everyone out there be careful when smoking dope, you really never know what could happen. I'm writing this after having come back from the hospital only 1 hour ago. I was with a friend having a few beers and she suggested we take some Kratom. I had never tried it, and after looking up some reviews online, I decided it seemed harmless and chose to take 3 grams with her. We then went to a friend's house where I was feeling fine, although maybe a bit tipsy from the beers and then all of a sudden I started feeling bad. I was sweating and needed to go to the bathroom. When I went to the bathroom, I stopped in the middle of peeing because I knew I was about to faint. I then decided to go outside and ask my friend to lie down in her bed. I never made it past the front door. I woke up to paramedics and went to the ER for an electrocardiogram among other tests. I'll be going back tomorrow, but until proven otherwise, I'm quite sure this was a result of either the Kratom itself or the mixing of Alcohol and Kratom. Although my friend also had roughly the same amounts of Alcohol and Kratom but didn't experience the fainting. I'm not sure what to make of it, but all I would say is be careful with this stuff.[Reported Dose: 3 grams Maeng Da Kratom capsules plus 3 beers] Me:63kg white male. 30 years old. Generally, my reactions to psychoactives are idiosyncratic; for instance, I loathe cannabis and MDMA makes me feel sad and antisocial. So take this report with a grain of salt-your mileage may vary. I probably have tolerance due to abortive low-dose mescaline trip 16 hrs earlier, several days light changa and bufotenine use, 5-MeO-MiPT seven days prior, and a light dose of MAL roughly two weeks back. It would be surprising wasn't some receptor down-regulation.Background:Positive or neutral experiences with: BZP (with and without TFMPP), salvia, mescaline, 5:MeO-DMT, DMT, NMT, ketamine, DXM, kratom, adrafanil, psilocybin, amphetamine, amanita muscaria, LSD, bufotenine, ayahuasca, nitrous oxide, hawaiian baby woodrose extract, ephedrine, mesembrine, sulbutiamine, miprocin, moxy, MAL, bk-2C-BNegative experiences with: cannabis, 2C-C, hawaiian baby woodrose whole, MDMA, phenibut(excepting mescaline and MAL, phenethylamines have never really proven very psychedelic or visual for me, and MDMA makes me miserable. I respond favourably to tryptamines).Mood: Neutral, uninvestedSetting: Home aloneTimeline:12:45PM Weighed, measured, and swallowed 45mg 6-APDB +/-2mg.1:11 Been noticing typical serotonergic spacy alert for a while now. Suggestion of nausea hasn't manifested yet.1:13 Really alerting now. Slight agitation. Heart a little racy.1:21 Mild tingling scalp. Some mild chest pressure. Just a suggestion of jaw tension.1:40 Colors are mildly brighter. Slight increase in jaw tension. Some hesitancy about eating, although I'm hungry. Vaguely toxic phenethylamine/speedy feel, like the 2c-xs. Have wanted to poop for a while now, but have been ignoring it. I'm not especially impressed with this space. I feel noticeably altered, but it's not particularly positively or negatively. There's no positive mood push. I'm guessing that higher doses might intensify the euphoria, the fogginess, and perhaps prove psychedelic. Zero music enhancement. Did get some insight on my life outlook and how it is shaped by societal expectations of work and leisure, how I am disenchanted by the absence of a space in my professional life for exploration and new experiences, that it's unlikely to change for decades, bringing me to a place where I will be less able to exploit the opportunity. My body is warming up nicely. My mindset is marked by a growing nonspecific sense of peace and cotentment.1:50 It's starting in earnest. I took the time to lay back, meditate, and listen to music, which sounds immersive. No mood lift can push through my body's sedentary lifestyle-induced endorphin deficit. Some OEV activity suggested, but not manifested-just a pleasant, plasticy high gloss and color enhancement that can't push through at this dosage. It's as though my vision wants to resolve into the aesthetic of Tim Burton's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.2:00 Had decided to work out to raise endorphins, then recalled that increased body temperature was the main cause of neurotoxicty, so I stopped my calisthenics. Kind of want some caffeine.2:06 Think I've reached plateau. Things are smooth and light reflections glossy, nice to look at. Scalp tingles slightly when touched. Other touch not much enhanced.Legs feel a bit restless, like on MAL. I have energy to do something, but nothing to do, which is not unpleasant. I just wish I had something to do that suited this space, as it is not psychedelic enough on its own to demand my attention. I would not drive like this, obviously, but a walk or gentle bike ride would be pleasant were it not brutally cold outside. Eating crackers and water over the last half hour produced no discomfort-I think I'm good to eat. Incidentally, this space is much nicer than MDMA for me, but that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. The visuals are similar but better than at 110mg bk-2c-b, music enhancement a little better. Some similarity to mescaline in terms of mental clarity, positive body, and sense of gentle peace. I think a dose of 125mg would be quite a bit more interesting.2:25 Seriously considered adding another 25-50mg either orally or through insufflation. Insufflation due to rapid onset and shorter duration, orally because of preference of agonism (psychedelia) over releasing (euphoria). Really would like more psychedelia. It's right on the cusp of being visually interesting in its own right, but too engrossing to do other things that might be entertaining.2:40 Dosed another 20mg +/-2mg orally.3:27 Might be feeling the second dose come on. Had the same toxic feeling as before when coming on, now has heavy serotonergic feeling and same subtle hint of nausea4:00 Serotonergic effects may be somewhat stronger, but subjectively don't feel like much has changed in the experience. Mood stable, more entactogenesis. More desireand inability to defecate. No change in visuals, body temperature. Ever so slightly more jaw tension. Didn't really add anything so far. Know I should eat food, butnothing sounds appealing. Appetite suppression then, I guess. Pretty clear headed for a serotonin releaser. I feel languid, so stressful video games are not appealing.Watching a movie or reading doesn't sound entertaining, though. Music is great. Shivers tingle across my bare torso when I scratch my nails across myself. Colours are more warm and the light in the room feels like it just got turned up. Some pupil dilation.4:20 Looking up from the book I'm reading, I note some dry mouth, more jaw tension, more compulsive swallowing. More OEV activity, plasticy glistening surfaces.4:30 I've been struggling to think of what this space reminds me of. I have compared it quite closely to bk-2C-B and loosely to mescaline. It lacks the dreaminess of LSA. So, synthetic gloss, mild but everpresent stimulation, and relatively clear head. It is much like a low-dose LSD experience with added entactogenesis and fewer (so far) side effects. That also explains my indifference to it, as my LSD experiences have never been all that profound or visually rich.5:00 Noting the start, ever so slowly, of the decline I believe.5:36 Noting some trippiness again. Now more like mescaline than lsd. I wonder if this is what MDA is like. There is absolutely zero empathogenisis with this material. The character is pretty neutral, although leaning towards the antisocial. Given that MDMA makes me want to flee other people's company and be miserable and solitary, that's a definite plus side to this substance. Eating is easy. So is not eating.7:15 Part of me thinks that I prefer a cup of tea to this: clean mood lift, clear head, calm, and a short duration. I recognize, though, that this could be quite nice in a situation where I was already enjoying myself thoroughly, such as an art walk or arboretum trip or outdoor concert perhaps. It's neutral tone could and long duration be an asset then. I think this is what Sasha and Ann would call a 'museum level' trip.7:45 Dropping off more proounced now; drinking a 10% beer now. Partner came home. Realized that, although I felt fairly lucid, I had some trouble with word finding in conversation. It was also a little hard to keep my mind on track while I was talking, and I struggled to speak at my usual fast pace. I'd place it somewhere between the serotoin releaser monginess and mushroomy linguistic center trouble.8:00 Drank three strong beers total and a weak cider. I recognize that mixing anything, particularly alcohol, with new RCs is stupid. I did, however, feel like the effects were almost entirely diminished bar residual stimulation, and was dreading a long night of drug-induced insomnia.Next day: A benzo may have been a better option over beer, as I woke several times in the middle of the night with a splitting headache. Drank a glass of water and took some baby aspirin each time, but still had a splitting headache in the morning after a very poor night's sleep. Ibuprofen and caffeine sorted me out tolerably well, although I was still pretty monged out (likely from alcohol and sleep deprivation.) Typing up this report at late in the following evening, I'm making bizarre and totally uncharacteristic spelling mistakes, but feel otherwise fine. There was no mid-week mood dip, but I've never had any post-MDMA or post-BZP+TFMPP mood issues before.Overview: Low level of side effects and easy, steady, long-lasting headspace make me think this would be great for a mellow day of strolling around a park or museum, maybe a sit-down outdoor concert. Doesn't offer a lot on its own to me at this dosage. Surprisingly unerotic. Let me set the scene for what must be my first place and second place most mind blowing experience ever - first place because it happened on AL-LAD, second because it wasn't quite as deep as an LSD experience (just). My previous 'hard' experience is as follows: LSA, LSD, AL-LAD, DOC, BK-2CB, aMT, Shrooms, Ketamine, MXP, Cannabis, MDMA, Mephedrone, Methylone, Speed, 3-FPM (I think that's all). We say the spontaneous/surprising nights are more often than not better than planned ones and, well, in this instance I must agree. Caveat - I don't endorse mixing alcohol and psychedelics as me and a best friend had pretty intensely difficult experiences after sharing a bottle of rum and dropping AL-LAD previously. But what happened this time BLEW ME AWAY, and I wish to let others know about the potential depths of what is considered quite a light, candy, surface drug. 8:40pm - 2:00am (Three ciders at 7.4%, one Heineken at 5%, two Stella Artois at 4.8%, tiny amount of 40% vodka - less than 20ml and about the same amount of 60% Absinthe.) I finished work at 8PM, went back to my house to sink a few ciders (two) before meeting up with workmates and going to a party. At 11pm, just before I left, I was feeling lethargic and wasn't sure If I would last the night through, so as a precautionary measure I took 30mg of 3-FPM in a gel cap.11:00pm - 30mg 3-FPM.Over the course of 3 hours, at varying locales, I drank one more cider, three beers and some spirits. Eventually getting turfed out of the house we were at, around 1:45am, me and a workmate decided we weren't ready to call it a night just yet. At this point, I must have been pretty drunk but the 3-FPM was keeping me from experiencing all the physical effects of the alcohol. I suggested we go back to his and smoke some cannabis - he lived too far away to walk, 40 minutes. Okay then, back to mine for some AL-LAD. ( FYI, he had drank less than me - he hadn't had three 7.4% ciders, but more or less the same amount of everything else.) We walked back to mine from Stratford which took about 20-25 minutes. I opened up about my life dividing LSD experience and he opens up about a very influential MDMA experience. He happens to be Italian and his English isn't the most intelligible - but nevertheless I was understanding everything he was saying perfectly, potentially due to the 3-FPM (although I imagine most of the effects would have worn off by this point). 2:25am - 300µg AL-LAD.We arrive at mine about 2:25 and we each drop 300ugs each of AL-LAD almost instantly. I play him some music I produced on the come up; he loves it and tells me its very emotional. Good vibes. He asks for some tobacco to roll with, but I haven't got enough to share all night - WAIT, HAVE THESE CIGARS! I give him two full boxes of shitty cheap Berlin cigars flavoured cherry and chocolate (that I wouldn't ever have smoked). He loves it. We lie on my bed waiting for the drugs to kick in, smoking. For my birthday my Mum got me a plastic pint glass with three LED lights in the base that flash at different iterations - very suited, very trippy. I put it on a constant setting, so it isn't intrusive, and it casts a green/red/purple/orange/yellow/blue swirl that sprawls over my wall and ceiling. Perfect.And eventually……. …...I BECAME THE UNIVERSE. About an hour after dropping I started looping pretty intensely, so much that I wasn't aware of it happening until I'd recognise that I'd experienced this mental/visual loop previously. The next sign of diving into the depths was music. I became the music - as in I forgot music was even playing. It was as if songs were arguing with themselves. For example, the bass line would be putting forward X hypothesis, the drums Y, the vocals Z and the treble A. And I'd flit from each distinct song element vibration exploring all the different points of view. This occurred until the song ended and I snapped out of it and realised what the fuck had happened - WHAT?!?! WHAT?!!?!?!?. This happened for every single song I listened to. Visual+physical+mental representation/perception of the sonic stimuli (potentially synthesis). At some point, my Italian friend asks for pen and paper and writes something down telling me to read it tomorrow. I oblige. After I'd become aware of this process repeating for every song, I let go and joined in. This is the part where things went deeper than I imagine ally from ever going. I decided to put on my favourite album of all time, Neutral Milk Hotel's 'In the Aeroplane over the Sea' and belt it out as loud as I could whilst I melted on my bed. Slowly but surely as I sung it, I became less and less aware of anything but the music and my 'self' - except all that 'I' was at this point was a vibration. The only thing that told me that I existed was that I could feel myself vibrating. I was a literal vibration in what was the entire universe - the primal energy, the initial vibration in the mid of God which is all of us and all of existence. I reverted back to the most base 'form', a constant that exists everywhere in reality - vibration (insert Bill Hicks quote about all matter being energy reduced to a slow vibration etc etc.) Needless to say, this was absolute ineffable ecstasy etc etc. After becoming aware of my existence as just a vibration at that moment I embraced it even more and allowed myself to join the 'vibratory conversation' that the songs were having. I sung even louder. As I sung I realised that I was singing almost too perfectly in time. I was not dragging or rushing. I slowly realised that I was creating the song - as I was singing it into existence. BUT HOW COULD I KNOW THE WORDS IF I WAS SINGING IT INTO EXISTENCE?!?! ETC ETC. This sent me into more fits on ineffable ecstasy. Perceiving/creating being the selfsame process etc etc. As if that wasn't enough, I started thinking about vibrations and which potential Hz-Khz vibration I was resonating at. This led me to contemplate numbers, then binary, then coding. All of a sudden I was being shown a vision of our earthly reality and behind its initial form (what we see and feel etc) there lied a sort of computer code (I don't know if it was similar to the matrix code, or if it was indeed computer code - I only made the connection afterwards). The code became more and more prominent until everything was embossed and had this code projected over it. Suddenly it all broke apart, dissipated, was erased. I experienced the perception that everyone and everything I love and are ever going to love is fleeting and potentially code in a cosmic fucking computer that we agreed to build and experience. My mum, my best friend, my fucking phone (the phone being both literal code and cosmic code). Every thought that my mum was ever going to have was just code. (I am aware that this i not a new or novel theory- I discovered the idea many moons ago. This is different as I ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED IT AS REALITY, not just as an idea.) MY MUM IS JUST CODE?! BUT THAT MEANS ME TOO. GOT I LOVE THAT FUCKING PIECE OF CODE. GOD I LOVE LIFE. GOD THIS CODE IS FUCKING AMAZING. I'M GONNA USE THIS PIECE OF CODE (my phone) TO TELL ANOTHER PIECE OF CODE (my best friend) THAT I (code) LOVE (code) HER (code). GOD (code). INEFFABLE FLEETING CODED FUCKING ECSTASY. I was still creating/singing the song as I experienced all this. As the last few bars of 'Two headed boy part two' sounded I snapped out of whatever that fucking was and turned off the music when it finished…WHAT THE FUCK JUST HAPPENED. Woah wait,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,, that was ALLYLYSERGAMIDE????!!!Boyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy.I sit up, turn to my mate and he utters:'Wow. W-O-W.''What the fuck just happened, mate?''I don't know.I've never experienced something like that before.'I asked him if he could explain what he experienced in Italian, instead of English as it would be easier for him, but he couldn't (not that I can speak Italian, but just to see if he was as flabbergasted as I was). I sit on my bed attempting to wrap my head around what was left of my integrating mind at that point, stunned, glowing. We chill on my bed a bit longer, listening to some Pavement as the drugs wind down. He leaves around 7:30am. Now that he was gone I find what he had written down: (his written English was about as intelligible as his spoken, bless him, this is what he wrote with my interpretations)'Foy, (meant 'Boy'?), never stop in the parrk (meant 'dark'?) get the flame and jump on!! ;). From Pappo(l). Singnal (meant 'signal'?) coincidenes (meant 'coincedences') good, great vibes. 'GOOD, GREAT VIBES.I eventually sleep, and wake up about 11:00am. Receive an email from my Mum - I burst into tears reading it. Nothing overly emotional about what she said, just love. Alcohol, you fucking beast. AL-LAD; your hidden depths are more fun, and as deep, than any other depths I've experienced through psychedelics.Funnest coded combination ever. Those of you familiar with benzo/thienzodiazepines may have chuckled at the title of this report – after all, amnesia is a common effect of this class of drugs.  However, the important factor in this experience is that I used a quantity of etizolam which I’ve used before (although I don't use it frequently enough to have much of a tolerance), and in a fashion that I’ve used it before, and it still blindsided me.  Here’s what happened:I spent most of my “day off” working overtime, and decided to drive 50 miles back to my hometown to spend the evening with my parents.  Since I intended to spend the whole night there, in safe circumstances, I thought it would be fun to take some etizolam.  I typically take it mixed in alcohol – NOTE, this is NOT recommended, but I have a high tolerance for alcohol and had combined it with etizolam a number of times before with no ill effects.  On this occasion I mixed approximately 5 milligrams of etizolam powder (using a microscoop rather than a scale, also not recommended) into approximately 2.5 ounces of 21 proof gin.  I drank half of the etiz-spiked gin, on an empty stomach, immediately upon parking in front of my parents’ house.  I shortly began to feel very mellow, and spent the next two hours watching a movie with Mom and Dad.  When it was over I still felt in control of myself, and decided to make a short trip to a nearby grocery store.  Announcing that I was going to the store is the last clear memory I have of that evening.  I have vague recollections of being at the store, of returning to find my Mom cooking a turkey breast, and, some time later, making up a plate of said turkey and some stuffing for myself.  The next thing I knew, I woke up on my parents’ couch at 6:30 in the morning.  I do not remember drinking the rest of the etizolam-gin, but I must have because I later found the bottle it was in empty.  The fact that I was asleep on the couch wasn’t strange – both of my parents were getting over a cold, and I’d told them in advance that I was going to sleep on the couch so one of them could have the spare bedroom so they wouldn’t keep each other awake coughing.  However, I had no recollection of actually going to sleep – or of putting on my pajamas, which I was wearing.  I did remember making up my dinner plate and realized that I hadn’t eaten it, so I quickly disposed of the food – which awakened one of my parents' three dogs, who came downstairs to join me - and went back to sleep until about 9 a.m., when my parents woke up.    I didn’t become particularly concerned about the blank spot in my memory until a bit later, when I pointed out an article in the previous day’s paper to my Mom, and she told me that I’d noticed it the night before and discoursed on it at some length.  As the day went on, Mom mentioned more and more things that I had no memory of, and I realized that I had utterly, completely lost about six hours of the night before.  My Mom - bless her a thousand-thousand times – didn’t seem overly concerned, and simply told me not to take “whatever it was” I’d taken again.  I, however, was nothing short of terrified – I had previously used at least twice that quantity of this same batch of etizolam in one evening, and I’d not experienced anything like this sort of blackout.  I’m writing this 32 hours after that first dose of etizolam, and as far as I know, there were no ill consequences (other than spending more money than I meant to at the store, and my Mom knowing I was on something).  However, I’m literally shaking in fear of what could have happened – in particular, I’m worried about their dogs, which I love more than any other living creatures aside from my parents – those dogs will eat just about anything, and I’m horrified at the idea that I might have left something dangerous lying around.  Assuming that nothing bad comes of this experience, I’m supremely grateful that this happened when I was in safe  circumstances.  From now on I will never use etizolam for anything other than therapeutic purposes (I do have occasional insomnia and anxiety attacks) – its recreational value is nowhere near worth the potential dangers. I have recently been experimenting with research chemicals and am pleased to say that I have found an online vendor who supplies pure chemicals in discreet packaging. Recently I have tried MPA, ethylphenidate and isopropylphenidate, which are all stimulants similar in effects to amphetamine. I also take prescription medication including sertraline which is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.[Erowid Note: Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.See this article on The Importance of Measured Doses.]THE EXPERIENCEI started my IPPD experiment by carding out a thin line and then dividing that in two. Sorry, I cannot tell you the exact quantity, but it was what most regular stimulant-users would describe as a 'bump'. I used a roll of paper to snort it then started a stopwatch. There was some burning/itchiness and a faint odour but not as much as with ethylphenidate. 15 minutes later there was no noticeable effect. My nose felt fine, no more itchiness and just a little drip at the back of my nose/throat. It didn't taste bad unlike other RCs I have tried (eg nitracaine).30 minutes after dosing, still no noticeable effect.45 minutes - I felt something. A slight amphetamine-type buzz and the urge to re-dose. So, I snorted the other half of the line.1 hour - I felt more lively and chatty and in a sociable mood. I visited my housemate, taking a bottle of Bolivian coca-leaf liqueur with me. I shared the IPPD with my friend.Over the next 8 hours, we shared the gram of IPPD, dosing approximately every 45 minutes, single lines. The lines were fairly thin lines approximately 3 or 4 inches in length.2 hours - I felt a very noticeable rush, elevation in mood, and increased sociability. I did not feel on edge. In fact, my restless leg syndrome had stopped completely (probably due to an increase in dopamine) and i felt energetic but relaxed and confident. So, at this point I was very much enjoying the experience. My friend remarked that it was like taking amphetamine and I agreed. By this point my friend was clearly 'high' and 'chewing' but there was no pupil dilation nor any other physical signs other than tension in the jaw. Personally, I have learned to resist the urge to chew, so apart from my enthusiasm you probably would not suspect I had taken a stimulant.Over the next few hours, I drank the entire bottle of Bolivian Agwa de Coca with tonic water and lime. My friend preferred to drink Belgian beer (aren't we decadent?!).The rest of the night is unclear in my memory except to say that we were both surprised at 3 in the morning that time had passed so quickly. Our conversation had been interesting and ranged over many topics. We were able to discuss contentious topics intelligently and amicably without once becoming irritated or defensive. There was no paranoia. In fact, by the end of the evening we both agreed that we felt closer as friends and hugged each other. This was not really due to any noticeable entactogenic effects of the IPPD but rather a consequence of the sparkling conversation and happy mood.I would say this is probably going to become a popular substance in universities, both as a social/club drug and as a nootropic study aid. I should mention that my friend was able to work throughout the evening on an illustrator project. So, in summary, I would describe isopropylphenidate as an amphetamine-type substance with all of the mood-enhancing and concentration benefits. A social drug and a nootropic. THE COMEDOWNNeither my friend nor I slept a wink that night. My friend went to work as usual and had a productive day despite feeling 'tired and wired'.I had a terrible hangover (probably due to drinking a bottle of liqueur rather than the IPPD). I felt restless and tense. I had a slight stomach ache and didn't want to eat. I felt dehydrated so sipped water throughout the day. In the evening, my housemate brought some fast food and I was able to enjoy the meal, although I didn't feel like finishing it and immediately afterwards rushed to the loo.That night I went to bed early, feeling exhausted. I slept fitfully, waking every few hours drenched in perspiration, my quilt and pillows soaked through. My friend had the same symptoms.More disturbingly, today I have had difficulty urinating and, when I do squeeze some out, it is painful and contains blood. This has never happened to me before, even during my years of ketamine addiction. It is slightly better after a relaxing bath but still painful.So, if you had asked me when I was taking the IPPD whether I would recommend it, I would have certainly recommended it enthusiastically. However, after the comedown, I would not. I preferred the IPPD high to other research chemicals but taking the physical comedown into account, I would have to recommend caution. MPA is probably my favourite of the current crop of 'legal' research chemicals. When I was a child, I swore that I would never use drugs in my life. I was against them and I never wanted to have anything to do with them. Why? Because I respected the adults that surrounded me. I heard the message that drugs that were deemed illegal by the government were dangerous and bad for your health. I believed every word of it. I was around kids my own age that received the same message from their parents and I maintained a drug-free life for many years.I had first been offered to smoke marijuana when I was in the beginning of my 8th grade year. It was my first opportunity and I rejected it due to being indoctrinated by the adults that my friends and I were always around. After that opportunity, I didn't come across another opportunity to do any type of controlled substance for several more years; however, in my 9th grade year, I had turned 15 and was being surrounded by friends of mine more frequently. My friends were very much your average adolescent teenagers who lashed out against their parents and did things against their wishes regarding drugs. This began my turn in my perspective of drug use. My friends had started drinking alcohol, and I was very much against it due to it being illegal for minors. One day, I decided I wanted to party with my best friend Alex who was a year older and far into the scene far before I knew about it. I drank for the first time in my life, outside of those sips of alcohol my parents offered me, and I was drunk for the first time in my life. It was an experience that I took for granted and would open up my life to inhibition of my mind.After my first night being drunk and my first hangover I was open to drinking alcohol because I liked the feeling of being drunk. It was something I hadn't experienced for the first 15 years of my life and I nearly fell in love with it right away. I wasn't addicted to alcohol nor was I addicted to being drunk. I was addicted to slowing down my mind. The sensation was something I hadn't experienced before and I liked it.By the time I had turned 16 I drank occasionally with friends but since I didn't have any friends old enough to buy alcohol, I didn't get drunk often. I did have friends that occasionally smoked weed, but I was still against it due to it being illegal. In retrospect I appreciate the irony however I don't know if I would be writing this if it weren't for my opinion back then. My opinion kept me out of trouble in school (regarding drugs). I continued to drink, until my worst experience with alcohol: alcohol poisoning. It happened when I was 16 and I had drank many times before at this point. I drank so much that I blacked out while at the mall and my friends ended up calling my best friend Matt to come pick me up. He showed up and so did his mom. She was incredibly pissed at me as I vaguely remember, however she took me to my house where I was handed off to my parents. I later woke up on the floor in only my boxers, laying on a towel. I later learned that my parents took care of me and I was absolutely shit housed. My punishment by my parents for drinking underage was very fair and I didn't drink again for several months. It was then that I learned alcoholism ran in my mom's side of the family and they weren't upset at me, more so worried that I had an alcohol problem at the age of 16. This was not the case however, and it is this reason that sparked my hypothesis on drug dependency and ADHD. My Papa doesn't have ADHD nor does my uncle or Mamoo (grandma). Both of which were alcoholics earlier in their life. Even now, my Mamoo and Papa drink nearly every night and are what are considered functional alcoholics. Alcohol doesn't cause a problem in their life but their body is dependent of the chemical. My body, when I drank alcohol did not feel a dependence no matter how often I drank, or even when I stopped drinking after a binge.Skipping ahead to my first time smoking weed, I was 17 (3 months from turning 18). The details of why I decided to try it are unimportant but it was along the lines of knowing I was joining the Army and didn't think I was going to have an opportunity to try it until I was out of the Army. This was an obviously uninformed rationalization on my part but I wouldn't take it back for the world. I fell in love with being high instantly. I had been around people who got high all the time and from a sober perspective being high doesn't look like that much fun at all. From a high perspective, it is easily one of the most enjoyable things I have ever introduced to my brain. From there on out, I smoked weed at every given opportunity that I could. The opportunities increased with the more friends I made that smoked weed. It was essentially a self-perpetuating cycle. I smoked weed with new people and later I would smoke with them again while new people came and smoked with us and I would then smoke with those new people later, etc.I was definitely considered a stoner by the end of my senior year. I wouldn't touch any other drug, due to the successful indoctrination of the adults in my life of how dangerous drugs were. I didn't do any research for myself so I believed everything that was told to me. I would have been able to do ecstasy nearly any day of the week, however that didn't appeal to me. I liked my marijuana and I was not looking for anything different. It was then that I accepted that I had an addictive personality. Prior to weed, the only thing I admit to being addicted to is video games. I spent countless hours on video games. Essentially years of life after adding up all the hours spent in front of the computer or TV were used playing video games. I say used, not wasted, because I do not regret any of those moments. However, I can honestly say that I have never had a physical addiction, only mental. This is the worse of the two, because your mind is powerful and is nearly impossible to separate from your body, whereas someone who is physically addicted to something can physically be restrained from doing something until the physical dependence subsides.I would consider myself addicted to the state of being stoned. My whole life, my brain worked faster than many of the 'normal' type people who surrounded me. I have always been much more impulsive, easily distracted, and I had ridiculously large amounts of additional energy. Getting stoned put my mind and body in a state of relaxation and I would appear much calmer than my usual self. While I was stoned, I could still think rationally, and I could still have brilliant epiphanies that I had when I was sober.Now, skipping ahead to the point where I had been in the Army for 9 months. I met another one of my best friends while in Alaska, named Devon. He told me about the 'legal' marijuana substitute called 'spice'. I decided to check this out for myself and I did a little bit of research online. I was skeptical of course because I didn't believe that I was going to be able to get high as if I was smoking weed, without being able to piss hot on a drug test. However, I took his advice and I ordered some.My first time trying it, I was instantly high. I was equally as high as I was when I was smoking weed. It acted exactly as though THC was in my body. This was something I started to abuse right away. I was back to my old weed-smoking self. I would get high as soon as I got off work. One bowl got me stoned and lasted hours. This however was my recreational use. Recreational in the sense of the amount I would smoke and frequency.About 6-7 months later, Devon did some more research and found out how to make spice. I jumped on this as soon as I found out. He found that the active ingredient in spice that actually got you high was the chemical JWH-018. This chemical acts as a cannabinoid agonist against the CB2 receptor in your brain. THC is a cannabinoid agonist against the CB1 receptor, and gets you high in a slightly different way. Regardless of the type of high it gives you, it still gets you high. I was suddenly able spend $100 to make 50g of spice where before I would be spending $75 for 3 grams. My pockets started to bulge with money because I no longer had to spend so much money to get high. I was getting stoned like never before. I would smoke around 10 grams a day after work and around 2 ounces between my friends every weekend. Life was good and I felt like I was a pioneer in the drug industry. I would sell small amounts here and there to people who were also as interested in the drug as I was. I wouldn't get greedy by any means but the operation to make the spice would pay for itself and I was then able to save my Army paycheck every month.I then began to experiment with other types of JWH and the amount I would use when making the spice which all acted in a similar fashion to 018, but some would trigger the cannabinoid receptors at different frequencies, so the high would be more intense. The beautiful thing behind the JWH series is that none of them are physically addictive and to those with normal type brains (those without ADHD/ADD) wouldn't even become mentally addicted. Several of my friends have ADHD/ADD like myself and we all had our love of spice in common. The friends that didn't have ADHD/ADD didn't like the stuff as much as us and were able to take frequent breaks in their use of the spice, compared to those of us that had ADHD/ADD. The problem with those of us that have ADHD/ADD is that our tolerance to the drug increased at a very rapid pace. Originally when we were buying 3 gram bags they would last us nearly all week. By the time we were making it in such large quantities, we could smoke ounces at a time and not get nearly as high as when we first started. Our friends with normal type brains did not experience their tolerance go up as much as us as fast. They eventually got to our level but it took a much longer time and all they'd have to do was to take a short break from smoking and they'd be back to their old tolerance. We weren't that lucky.This is where this article becomes very applicable to the title. We found yet another research chemical (JWH is a research chemical), a drug that was made in laboratories and very little testing has been done on it and is not recognized to be illegal, called 2C-E. This was something on a completely different level. In short, it was Super Acid.I had never had experience using any other drug in my life outside of the cannabinoid type drugs and was trying something completely outside my normal realm of drug use. 2C-E is best described as a combination of Acid and Ecstasy combined into one little pill. The amount for an average dose is around 20 milligrams. Since I didn't have prior experience and I knew this was a research chemical I was prepared to take a light dose. I split the pill between 2 other friends and it sent us tripping balls for 9 hours. It was an incredibly strong drug and I threw up due to the body overload I received. I was able to watch walls melt, paintings dance, toilets talk, small cracks in the ground became canyons that I could scale, etc. I had no experience with this and it was the greatest thing I have ever taken. My senses (touch, sight, and sound) were multiplied by 3. The amount of happiness I felt was completely unsurpassed in anything I've done in my life before. Imagine the carefree joyous experience you felt when you were a kid who woke up on Saturday morning after school and Saturday morning cartoons were ready to be watched and then you'd go outside and play with your friends and have no cares in the entire world. Nothing could possibly go wrong to ruin your day. Now multiply that by 3 and you'll know what that happiness felt like when I was on 2C-E. My other friends who were also tripping with me all felt the exact same way and they all had ADHD/ADD. Our brainwaves were completely synchronized. We were able to see what the other saw in our hallucinations and we could affect the world to each other and see the exact same thing. It was absolutely phenomenal. Keep in mind, this was all of us on 2C-E and all with ADHD/ADD. The next day we all felt mentally drained, but that was due to the power of the drug, and we did not have any sign of dependencies.Another time, we had another friend who did not have ADHD/ADD try it with us. She started out the exact same way as us. She felt very happy, saw the amazing visuals, and even threw up from the body overload. It was during this time I realized that not everyone responds to drugs the same way. Yeah, no shit I heard it before, I just never experienced anyone having a bad trip and to this day I still have never had one despite the negative things that have happened to me during my trip. We were all enjoying the trip and then she started having a bad trip. She saw something in the mirror that she didn't like which was her distorted self image and she punched the mirror. It broke and she started freaking out. She felt the extreme emotions of anger and sadness which I did not think was possible because I was literally incapable of feeling those emotions while on the drug.I've talked with all my friends regarding it and even after that bad trip she tried it again and had a blasty blast. But it was the fact she was able to have a bad trip that raised my questions in the differences between those of us that took it. The difference was that she did not have ADHD. This was only a hypothesis and one 'test' is not something you can base your final result off of.Later on I found out some of my friends dappled into using cocaine. I did not partake in this due to the fact that I just am not interested in trying something that doesn't make me trip. I personally love to see hallucinations and trippy stuff and I am well aware that cocaine is not something that will do that for you. What I heard regarding this was that since cocaine is a party drug it amps you up and all that good stuff and I already knew that cocaine is definitely associated to addiction. Our same 'normal type' friend was part of the group that did it and after her first few lines she was experiencing symptoms that my friends recognized as fiending (the bodies craving for more to feed it's physical addiction). The friends of mine that have ADHD/ADD did not feel any of the physical dependencies with coke.Their experimentation with the coke didn't last long enough for the mental addiction to set in, but the instant physical addiction associated with coke was not present in those with ADHD, compared to the one who did get the near instant addiction.After a period of time I met more people and separated myself from others but maintained my friendship with my friends that have ADHD/ADD and we decided to start trying more hallucinogens. This was where we discovered 2C-I.I describe 2C-I as a mushroom and ecstasy sandwich. I have not personally taken ecstasy but when I was on 2C-E everyone was telling me that the body buzz feeling is associated with ecstasy so I know that if I were to take ecstasy I know exactly what to expect. The active ingredient in Mushrooms that cause you to trip is psilocybin. 2C-I causes the body buzz in conjunction with the trip of psilocybin (which I have taken straight). I would consider 2C-I a mild form of 2C-E. It's more of a party drug than 2C-E because not everything is nearly as intense to deal with. I consider it a 'energy' drug. It's magical because I can pull myself out of a trip if I want to. 2C-E is far more difficult to control however it is still possible if you have a strong mind which is something I strongly associate with ADHD/ADD. When I say energy drug, I mean that if the people around me are partying and the energy is high, I'll feel like I'm rolling. If the energy is low and people around me are tripping out to colors and visuals, I will to. If nobody is doing either and I am just talking and having an intelligent conversation my mind will be incredibly open and I'll have amazing intelligent thoughts that just fall into place as well. If I am around someone else who has been drinking but not on 2C-I I'll actually start to get a little drunk without having any alcohol in your system. It's a very mind expanding drug similar to mushrooms. One of the glories of the drug is that it over rides all previous body inhibiting drugs. For example, I can smoke a shit ton of weed/spice and I won't get high and I can drink a nearly endless amount of alcohol and I won't get drunk. In my opinion it's best to take by itself and just enjoy the ride wherever you want to take yourself to.My friend Devon had a brilliant idea of putting 2C-I into an absinthe bottle. He measured out the amounts so that 1 shot of the absinthe will equate to 1 dose of 2C-I (about 20-25 milligrams). He brought this bottle to a party in which many people took a shot or several if they were already drunk and didn't realize the potency of the drug. Since the drug doesn't actually start to kick in until around 45 minutes to an hour after oral consumption (30-35 minutes if consumed nasally) many people started freaking out when the 2C-I kicked in. Not everyone had a bad trip but the people that did were people who did not have ADHD/ADD.I have later discovered in my research that those with ADHD (not associated with ADD) actually have a naturally high production of serotonin. This allows us to feel happier and overcome other natural emotions such as sadness, fear, and anger, which are emotions that cause for a bad trip. So from the above experiences with the various drugs and hours of additional research from various scientific websites regarding ADHD/ADD I have come to the conclusion that many drugs are indeed affected by ADHD/ADD in a positive fashion. It allows for users to have an overall positive experience when taking drugs of different sorts without the potential of the negative side affects associated with the drug being used.I am in no way a scientist with a degree, nor do I have credentials for being considered an 'expert' in the field. I have written this article through my experiences and read articles of scientific research done by professionals for hours to come to my conclusion.I hope my article will lead to more research in the scientific community on this very topic. I have abstained from all psychoactives for 30 days. I've done this routine plenty of times, so I thought I would finally contribute to the community and document it for the record. I'm listening to my favorite upbeat music throughout. I ate some cheeseburgers 4 hours ago. Looking forward to the mild experiment that follows:[t+0h:00m] Ingest 40mg ephedrine hcl in the form of 4x 10mg broken in half pills, with a cup of lemonade (organic, not from concentrate). Lemonade is alkaline, and that will supposedly improve the bioavailability of ephedrine, but who knows. From my experience, the ephedrine will reach peak effects at exactly T+1:00.[T+0:15] Heart is beating harder. I feel like boxing or jogging, or playing an online first-person shooter, mainly in anticipation of the imminent stimulation.[T+0:30] Ingest 3oz (2 shots) of whiskey. This will negate all the negative non-psychological stimulant effects of the ephedrine (hard heart beat, shakiness). Not that they're very intense, so more importantly it will add a euphoric effect that ephedrine alone lacks. Since I don't have a tolerance to alcohol at this point (abstained for a month), the way two shots will hit is just right. The alcohol will also reach peak effect at T+1:00.[T+0:45] Since T:0:30 I've been playing a first person shooter online (cod4). I'm in first place with a 4:1 ratio. For anyone who knows about FPS games, that's very desirable :). I'm normally very good, and I attribute the enhanced reflexes and cognitive improvements to the ephedrine and the way alcohol suppresses the second-guessing mechanism in my brain. I'm effortlessly landing shots that I legitimately didn't expect to land, and I'm noticing myself moving frantically yet with a calculated flow.[T+1:00] As planned, the effects of both the ephedrine and alcohol have peaked. I've been told by friends with stimulant experience who have tried this that the feeling right now is comparable to a low dose of amphetamines. In my own words, it feels like I'm at a really good party with lots of friends, or I'm boxing someone and wrecking them. Basically, the feeling is that of unquestioned confidence, unnecessary happiness, slightly numb, and I feel like doing something productive. The effect is perfect for parties or social times, particularly because ephedrine lacks a 'comedown'. At this point I masturbate for 15 minutes in an effort to release even more happy chemicals in the brain. My thoughts throughout are aggressive, and the orgasm is powerful and lasts longer than usual, but within seconds my dick is flacid again and I've all but forgotten about it.[T+1:15] With the rush of serotonin or dopamine or whatever orgasms release, I'm feeling quite awesome for a completely legal experience. I wish I could feel like this x10, for several hours, but I suppose that's what amphetamines feel like. I feel perfectly content, and I'm smiling at the thought of effortless joy. I have an urge to do something that would benefit from my enhanced mental state. I also feel as though excelling at something would further increase the mild blissfulness. Now I blast the music and finish writing this report. Feels good man.[T+1:15+] From my experience (been doing this for more than 2 years), this is how the rest of the experience will unfold: I will feel great like this for another hour. Starting at T+:2:00 the feelings will begin to fade away over the next 2 hours. At T+4:00 I will be essentially sober. The afterglow feels like being very mildly 'out of it'. Throughout the entire experience and afterward, achieving sleep is not at all difficult.For reference, I don't do any (other) drugs. I eat organic and abstain from caffeine and nicotine. I use the ephedrine no more than once a month, and not always that often. The best times are at parties or unusually fun times with the girlfriend. She also likes ephedrine, as do all of our friends. The general consensus in my circle is that it's a great pick-me-up, particularly because it lacks a significant comedown. It's most enjoyable when accompanied by the rush from drinking a medium amount of alcohol all at once (i.e. 2 or 3 shots at once), specifically when there's absolutely no tolerance to alcohol (alcohol produces a much more euphoric feeling when there's NO tolerance), on an empty stomach. This is the first time I have ever had a whitey. For those of you unfamiliar with the term 'whitey' it basically means you have a bad reaction to weed (or any other drug) and become very cold, drowsy, nauseous and feel distant from reality.I have been smoking weed regularly for about 5 months now. Usually 4 times a week, sometimes more, sometimes less. Since I have started I have not been without weed for more than 8 days.Now, I will explain the story.It's a Thursday night, and I have arrived at the after party of the school formal ready to get baked. I meet up with some guys and we go to the back of the house to construct a bong. We each have 2 cones then move away from the house as not to get caught.After 15 minutes or so we walk down to the back of the yard behind a large tree and each pack more cones. At this point I have had 4 cones and decide to stop. Also, prior to the weed I have consumed 1 beer and 1 can of Jim Beam and Coke and about 3 cigarettes.So, I head back up to the house and make my way outside to where the majority of people are. I light another cigarette and start talking to people. At this time, it would be about 5 minutes since I've had the weed.10 minutes after I've finished with the weed I start to feel a bit light headed so I sit down on a ledge. I guess my skin was starting to go pale, because one guy stopped in front of me and said 'Fuck man, you're chucking a whitey. You're gonna pass out and start spewing soon.' This gets me worried and I move to a chair about 1 metre away from me.It's now 15, maybe 20 minutes since I smoked the weed. This feels completely different to my normal highs. I am cold, very, very cold. Similar to the cold sweats I get after taking tramadol and falling asleep. I have a huge headspin which I do not usually get from weed, but I guess the cigarettes added to this. My friend gives me his jumper and I put it on and rest my head in my hands. I'm feeling sick and tired and still very cold.30 minutes after the weed. Sitting on the same chair, just staring blankly at the ground. People are starting to come over and ask if I'm alright. I do my best to tell them I'm ok and I just need to sit down and be on my own. Now, people have started pulling up chairs and sitting in front of me. This is not fun at all because they keep moving my head to look at my eyes which apparently were very red and bloodshot, more so than usual after I've smoked weed. People keep constantly poking at me and saying things like 'Let's put his hand in water so he pissed himself' or 'Let's draw a penis on his face.' This was frustrating because at this time I could hardly move or open my mouth. All I wanted to do was sit on the chair and close my eyes.50 minutes into it and the crowd is still big. Different people coming and going. Most of them are telling me how bad it is to have a whitey and all the things I can expect to happen. For a minute I start to feel better and open my eyes to look around. Then the nausea comes back and I close my eyes again.Shortly after this two girls come over to me and check my pulse, but they push a bit too hard and I have trouble breathing. This makes me even more nauseous and I aim my head over the side of the chair. Then, someone grabs me by the shoulders and shakes me. This is what caused me to vomit. But this is good, I feel much better now. Not great, but better.I am given a glass of water and some paper towel to wipe my mouth.Now it is maybe an hour and ten minutes since I have smoked the weed. I can feel the come down happening. My mouth is starting to get saliva in it, but still very slowly. I get up from the chair and walk over to the big fire and sit down. This brings my temperature back up and I start to feel good. At this time it is about 1:30 in the morning. Other people come and sit by the fire with me and I am able to communicate a little bit with them. I spend the most of the remaining time at the party sitting in front of the fire. At about 2:40 I get up and meet with my friends and tell them that we are getting picked up at 3. I am feeling normal again now. No sickness and I am able to talk. I almost feel like smashing a few more cones or having some more drinks but decide against it.It's 3:00 and we leave. We arrive back at my house and go to bed at about 3:30. I remember sometime in the morning waking up with an incredibly bad cramp in my left leg which lasts about 5 minutes. It reminds me of the cramps I get after I've taken Hawaiian baby woodrose seeds, except a lot more painful.I awake about 12:00 and notice my left leg is still very sore and tight.Although this experience was bad, I think it is good that it happened (although it would have been better if it was not at a party) because now I know what to expect and do in the future if this happens - just sit down away from people, keep my eyes still or closed and just wait to vomit.This has not put me off weed, alcohol or cigarettes, but in future I will only smoke weed once I have finished drinking and not worry about cigarettes at all seeing as they give me huge headspins and lower blood pressure. About a week ago, I experienced what is probably the craziest, most hectic night I've ever had.  It was my friend, Mary's, 18th birthday, so my friend, Dave, and I decided to throw a party for her. I picked up Mary around 4pm and took her to get her navel pierced. After Mary got her piercing, when went to the mall to get food, and then to Dave's apartment.We arrive at Dave's apartment to find about eight of our friends there hanging out. It was about 8pm when the party really began.T + 0:00We start the night off by smoking some DMT. I had a half a gram of DMT, which came out to about ten doses. I purchased a glass ball freebase pipe to use with the DMT so I could properly vaporize it. I dumped 50mg into the pipe. I intended to take three hits but as soon as I exhaled the first hit, I decided one was enough for my first time. I handed the pipe to one of my friends and laid back on my friend's bed. I instantly felt the most euphoric I've ever felt. My body felt completely blissful, this was the best physical sensation I've ever felt. There was about seven of my friends standing around me watching me and laughing. The walls and doors behind them began to bend and breathe. Colors became extremely vibrant, almost to the point it was overwhelming. I close my eyes and saw a huge striped wall. In front of the wall were two giant blobs of goo that were morphing and spinning around each other. Eventually I opened my eyes and gradually returned to reality.T + 0:07Five other people at the party tried the DMT as well, but Mary said she wanted to wait until later in the night. Mary wanted to start the night off with a roll. I weighed out 0.3g of methylone for Mary, gave it to her, and she swallowed it. I then also ate 0.3g of methylone. After the others finished with the DMT, they also ate some methylone.For the next two hours, we listened to music, played beer pong, and hung out together.T + 2:00I just remembered I had a sheet of blotters with 1000 micrograms of 25c-NBOMe on each tab. Jokingly, I said to Mary, 'So are you trying to eat some NBOMe or what?' Surprisingly she was eager to eat some, and it was her birthday, so I wasn't going to stop her from doing what she wanted to do. When everyone else realized what she was taking, about six other people wanted to take some too. Mary took two tabs, and everyone else took one, including me. T + 3:00I'm rolling pretty hard, but not tripping very hard. I take three shots of Patron. Mary and another one of my friends each roll a blunt. We go outside and smoke the blunts. When I come back in, I'm pretty fucked up but still not tripping very hard. Mary tells me she's seeing trails and tripping very hard. She asks me to take more NBOMe so I will be on the same level as her. Wanting to please the birthday girl, I agree. I take one more tab. Then I eat another 0.3 grams of methylone. Mary snorts a few lines of methylone.T + 4:00Now I'm tripping hard. I am really fucked up. I can barely function normally. I start to notice Mary is saying some slightly weird things and acting a little strange. I figured she was just really fucked up and didn't think much of it.T + 5:00Mary's behavior is gradually becoming stranger and more erratic. She is very hyper and can't seem to stay in one room for more than five minutes. Everyone was wondering why she was acting a little weird, but her behavior wasn't crazy enough for anyone to speak up about it.T + 6:00There is now clearly something wrong with Mary. She is running around the apartment, room to room, being very loud and hyper. Her behavior gradually becomes even more erratic. She took off her shirt and was running through the apartment in her bra. She is yelling, laughing, and making sex noises. All the movement caused her navel piercing to bleed several times. Each time she would notice it was bleeding, she'd start crying but kept running around. In hindsight, I realize how terrible of an idea this was but I then asked Mary if she wanted to smoke her DMT yet. She agreed and smoked 50mg. It only made her act crazier. I tried to explain to Dave that I had never seen her like this before. I was embarrassed because Dave didn't know Mary before the party. I asked to have the party at Dave's and he agreed even though he didn't know Mary.T + 7:30Mary is running up to guys and making sex noises, latching on to them and humping. A couple who lives in the apartment comes out of their room after being woken up by all the commotion. At this point, Mary loses her bra too and is running around topless. The owners of the apartment then told me we had to leave. They said they were sorry but couldn't have her making so much noise and commotion so late at night in their apartment complex. One of the guys who was at the apartment took Mary and told me to come over to his place across the street. He left with Mary and I soon followed in my car with his girlfriend. I get to his apartment, which is empty because he's about to move. Mary is still freaking out and demands we take her back to the other apartment.T + 8:00Mary asks me for some water, so I pour her a glass. As soon as I give it to her, she throws it across the room at the wall. She's now making me very angry. I try very hard to not yell at her angrily. I ask her why she threw the water and she punches me in the chest and runs out of the room. She tries to run outside but I stop her. She then runs up to me, grabs me, and begins making out with me. As soon as she starts she stops and runs out of the room. She runs out of the apartment and up the stairs outside. She tries getting into an apartment, thinking it was the one we were in earlier but it actually belonged to someone we did not know. I get her back inside and try to keep her calm.T + 9:00Dave gets her to lay down on his bed and watch TV. She still appears agitated but has finally calmed down.T + 10:00She begins asking me about certain things she did during the night. She seems confused as to why she did what she did. Gradually, she remembers bit by bit what occurred that night. She becomes extremely embarrassed and apologetic when she remembers how she was acting. Neither of us knew exactly what caused her to act that way. I did the same amount of drugs she did, but I suppose with a drug cocktail like we had, it wouldn't be too hard to become psychotic.This is by far the craziest night I've ever had and I'll never forget it. So at this time I was 19. It was in December (spice products became illegal in January) and I just got a new batch of NBOMe blotters. I've been experienced with these before, I had tripped approximately 12 times before this experience. I always took 2 mg (2 blotters) of 25i-NBOMe. Well, I told my buddy that these weren't doing it for me and it was getting kinda expensive and to kick it up a notch. Little did I know, that I was about to have the trip of my life with the new batch.Now, he said these were stronger and there was a larger dose to each blotter (2mg/blotter). What he didn't tell me is he changed the type of NBOMe. I am used to 25i; he gave me 25c. 25c is far more visual, and 25i is more of a high an euphoric feeling.+0:00. I put the blotters in to test around 6pm after work, careful to keep on the upper gums for max results. I only do 2 since I know I'll be taking about 4 mg. This is a high dose since they are active at 500 μg.+0:30. I kept sucking on them through my upper gums to completely absorb the chemical, and was careful to not swallow my spit. At this point I can definitely feel the effects, and the come-up was a bit rapid for the next half an hour.+1:00. I am almost at the peak already, at least the peak of what I'm used to. I started to smoke some ultra strength spice product to better enjoy my high. The moment I hit my water pipe, my roommate (A) came home with a couple of her friends. She doesn't know I do acid, so I had to blame my pupil dilation on the spice.+2:00. After chatting for an hour with her friends that I just met, a couple of her other friends came over and brought alcohol. (A) asked me to plug in her wall fan cause (I) was over heating. I found it difficult to move since my heart rate was up, and I was over heating myself. I plugged the fan in, and looked like a complete moron, cause I couldn't figure out how to turn the damn thing on.+2:30. Around this time, we start playing beer pong. I've smoked a few bowls of spice now and I am tripping out of my mind. The alcohol wasn't helping much either. Somehow, even as the cups get father away, then close up again, I was able to make a few, and ended up winning 3/3 games.+3:00. After a few rounds of beer pong, which felt like forever, I decided to go to the bathroom. I looked at myself, and my eyes are black. Hardly any color is showing anymore and I have full blown visuals. The carpet was swirling and as I looked at the wall behind the toilet, I saw a face in the wall. It creeped me out a little, yet at the same time I was fascinated by this. I drink and talk for a few more hours.Time seems to drag on, only a few hours has gone by, and it feels like an entire day has gone by. I am in a slight bit of pain in my legs, it only happens when I move too much. I laugh way too much, everything seems to be funny to me. I am having the time of my life.+5:00. Things start to wind down a bit. I decide to smoke from my glass bowl. I hadn't smoked from it in a long time and forgot just how good it hits. I ended up smoking way too much and discover that spice products increase visuals. I was way too high, and had to sit with my face in my hands until I came down a little bit. Every time I looked up, I saw faces in the wall, or I saw people doing things they weren't really doing. I was a little panicky at this moment. My roommate (A) was beside me and I was sure she could tell I was a little out of it.After all of that, things started to wind down and a couple people had to leave. Everyone who stayed ended up going to bed. I couldn't sleep till about 3 in the morning because of the NBOMe. Overall, I had a blast. Even though it is a research chemical, it is one of my favorite substances to take. I would recommend anyone to try it. I felt fully rested the next morning, and filled with energy. But usually after that after effect, my body is completely exhausted. Wondering about the psychopharmacology of a substance with little known about it, I obtained a sample of 5-Methoxy-Tryptamine from a chemical supplier. The only scientifically known use for this material is as a radiation protectant.With all trials, there was some body discomfort, specifically in the lower intestine and heart (increased blood pressure and heart rate). Most discomfort disappeared after 30 minutes.The setting was at various apartments and also 2 hours on a train observing the sky and trees and buildings.(with 5mg, oral) No observed effect.(with 15mg, insufflated) Just above baseline. I observed a very slight increase in my base mood and found conversations to be more entertaining. Appreciation of color and detail also slightly enhanced. After consumption of Cannabis, the mood elevation was marked.(with 40mg, insufflated) Similar to 15mg dose. However, the effects lasted about 8 hours, with sudden rushes of euphoria and slight visuals. There seems to be a synergy between this substance and Cannabis, acts as a subtle enhancer for other chemicals. Like tea compared to Arabian coffee in strength. Very gentle. The 'drunk' feeling of Alcohol was also enhanced.(with 150mg, insufflated) Possibly up to a plus 1 (+) or higher. Lasts a VERY long time. Become slightly tired at this dosage level. Sleep at 12 hours was very easy. At this dosage, comparable to Melatonin in drowsiness. Enhanced the effects of Cannabis to the point where 8 hours after smoking 2 bowls, I still perceived a 'stoned' feeling. Had several friends assay 10mg doses, but only minimal observed effects. A female remarked that the sky was very beautiful and it was strange that she was noticing that fact.In summary, this appears to be a chemical with no known human experimentation that is producing above baseline effects. Future reports will follow... Background: I am an 18 year old male college freshman. I am 5'7' and about 165 lbs. I have dysthymia (chronic, moderate depression) and am on 75 mg of Zoloft. This took place in a small house with about 8 other people. I knew one very well and two moderately well. The others I had never met before, but I trusted them and had no misgivings.I had smoked marijuana 5 or 6 times before this instance, but had felt mild (if any) effects. The first two times, I felt nothing at all. The next few times I did so, I would feel mildly giddy and a bit 'looser', some 'munchies', and some weird physical sensations like heightened awareness of my teeth, increased sense of smell, mild headache, bodily tingling. During these experiences, my friends were all much more affected than I was, even though we had smoked the same amount (or I had smoked more, even). I thought that I knew what it was like to be high, that marijuana just didn't affect me as it did others, but I was apparently wrong.My friend told me that he wanted to finally get me properly high, and I agreed, though skeptical that it would actually happen. Around 10:30 P.M., the two of us and another acquaintance smoked from my friend's pocket vaporizer as we walked to another acquaintance's house. It was probably a bit under 30 degrees, so we were all very cold. As we walked, I could tell that the two of them were getting high, but I couldn't tell about myself. In total, I think that I took 4 hits. Around 15 minutes after I had taken my final hit, I began to feel slightly different. I felt 'looser', especially in my shoulders and back. I also felt a bit clumsy.When we stepped into the warmth of the house, things started feeling surreal for me. I figured that the cold weather had halted my experience of the high. I felt quite odd as I shook hands with my friend's housemates, and yet also at ease. After some amount of time, we walked down the hall into the kitchen. We were there for a while, but I have no idea for how long. I only know that that was when I started to really, really feel things. I felt unsteady and as though I were in a dream. Time began to be extremely distorted; what was really ten minutes felt like two hours. Things also almost felt as if they were wobbling or moving. I had completely forgotten what the rest of the house looked like, even though I had probably just seen it. I just felt very, very strange and dissociated. At one point, I felt as if I were in an anti-drug PSA. Even at the time, this was funny to me, but for some reason I had the intense feeling of this. I also had the feeling of being an absolutely stereotypical college student, and kept fixating on that. Around this time, I also had 3 jello shots which supposedly each contained 1/3 of a shot of Everclear. I was feeling weird. I'm not sure if I would say that I was feeling 'good', just weird. 4 or 5 friends came in to the apartment, talked for a while (again, I have no idea for how long), and then left. Eventually, we all went upstairs. My mouth was feeling very dry, so I got a glass of tap water. That tap water tasted so fucking amazing! It was like liquid gold. I also started nursing a beer around this point. My movements felt somewhat slowed. I started playing a (bad) game of Beer Pong with a friend. My hand-eye coordination did not seem that impaired, but then again it's not normally spectacular. Someone came out and started playing his electric guitar on a tiny amp, and it sounded absolutely awesome to me. The music just seemed to flow.I shotgunned a beer with two people and then went into someone's room. The two people I came with took a couple more hits, but I abstained. I was still nursing my first beer. The interesting flavor was wearing off and it was once again beginning to taste unpleasant. I took a few sips of someone's Pepsi/Bacardi concoction.We went back downstairs and played a game of Super Smash Bros on N64. I was playing, but I completely lost track of my character and wasn't playing correctly; I died very quickly. I went and sat in another chair; I don't really remember anything specific happening after this. I just sat there for a while and people may have been talking. After a while, someone announced that pizza was being ordered. I was told that I needed to experience this stuffed breadstick thing, and that it would be amazing. It probably took an hour or so to be delivered, but it felt like an eternity. It arrived, I ate it, and it was quite good. The cheese and grease was spectacular. I was starting to feel tired and knew that I should head back to my dorm and go to bed. At this point, it was about 2 A.M. The two people that I came with headed back to our dorms. I don't really remember the walk back, except that my acquaintance and I both said that we'd felt we had been in an anti-drug PSA. I got back to my room and climbed into bed after brushing my teeth and changing. I put on my iPod and listened to two songs by the band Foals, which sounded quite nice. It was like sound was alternating nicely between my ears. I went to sleep around 3 A.M., and woke up at noon feeling fine. A previous time I'd smoked, I had woken up the next morning and had felt like complete shit. I was groggy and had a headache for the entire day. I was glad that I didn't experience that again.Being high like this was not what I expected. I had thought that I'd get more positive, 'fuzzy', warm feelings. I had expected to be giddy and euphoric, maybe contemplative. I didn't get any of that, and instead felt very detached and dissociated. The time warp was weird and unexpected. I'd call my experience weird, but not good or pleasant, exactly. I will probably do it again. Precursor to the events that took place on February 6th, 2009, I had been grounded for a drug related issue. Although at high school, I had happened to obtain some Zolpidem tartrate, commonly know as Ambien in the United States. I had been interested in pharmaceuticals for quite some time, and three 10mg pills were only $6 so I took advantage of such a generous offer. I had to wait until Friday to initiate the inebriation, but I already had some friends ready to come and whisk me away from my unlawful punishment.T+0:15 - After taking two Ambien 10mg, I began to have a very heavy feeling developing in my head and chest, and became subject to some odd movements of inebriety. I decided to lay my head down on my bed and appreciate the physical benefits of Ambien. After gazing at my closet for a while, I noticed its squarely decorated front begin to shift and sway, even breathe in a slow, uniform way. I looked around only to recognize that everything had become so much more immersive, walking on the carpet was like traversing soft flowing sand. For an arbitrary reason, I began to think about plants. After closing my eyes for a short period, I opened them only to see a bright green bushel of vegetation emerging from my carpet. I then received an AIM message from my friends notifying me of the chance of them swinging by my house later in the evening. I accepted their offer to peak me up and visit a friend’s house for a little “party”, and decided to meet up with them at 11:30 outside my house.T+1:00 - I had one extra pill with me, and decided I would insufflate it when we got to my friends house to increase the peak of the experience. On the car ride there, I was tripping fairly hard. I gradually grew annoyed of my sober friends, and felt a little jealous of the clarity that they possessed. As we got to my friends house, I had to hold a girls hand to get through various obstacles safely. Everything was feeling numb, but in a warm, soothing way. The same way one would feel after having a hot shower. I insufflated the third pill and suffered a bombastic burning sensation. After the task was complete my friends and I dove into voluptuous discussion dealing with everything from inside jokes to personal epiphanies. An analytical game we always loved to play, was the dissection of certain words to expose their connotations, and how each individual has different feelings about different words. T+1:25 - Feeling intensely euphoric and empathogeneous, I embraced my friends several times. We then agreed to slink over to the garage area of her house and smoke some cannabis.  After completing this activity, the hallucinations became fairly intense. I remember feeling very magnetic and having pillars of support surround me. Wanting to lean on one of these pillars, I attempted to lean back, only to fall through a vivid hallucination and embarrass myself. I was in a very comfortable environment, talking to some of my closest friends intelligently about drugs, philosophy and life in general. A bottle of pomegranate peach schnapps was being passed around, and against my better judgment, I enjoyed about a glass of it. Lights were becoming softer, and the extrovert in general was becoming easier to understand. The thoughts I experienced seemed to melt from the concrete into the abstract.T+2:00 - Now things were starting to get a bit weird. Although I was having a good time, my mind was exploding into thought of arbitrary memories, almost like my life was flashing before my eyes. I did my best to sit down on the couch, inhabited partially by my friend. I fell asleep on her for what must have been about 20 minutes, and woke up feeling mellow and centered. Wanting to prolong this feeling, I purchased a single pill of Oxycodone (5mg) and attempted to divide it up equally. I took one-half orally, and insufflated the other half a short time afterward. This brought on a familiar feeling of warmth and lucidity, which I felt could resemble hydrocodone, which I was hoping to come into contact with. At this time, another bowl was enjoyed with my friends, and even some others who I had befriended that evening. We talked cordially about the chemistry of common life, and I found my ability to produce statements of logical structure even better than I am able to while sober.  Didn't really expect to take 4-HO-MET the night I did, but a good situation came up and I figured it would be a good time to try it.I'm not exactly sure on the dosage, my scales a little iffy. It could have been anywhere between 18mg and 10mg.  Well, here it goes.9:30 PM: Arrive at house party.  Meet up with a few people, enjoy a beer and a mixer.  I mixed a gatorade with about tequila and vodka, enough to get me a bit more than just 'tipsy'.11:15 PM:  We leave the party, it's starting to get huge and might get busted soon.  I originally drove to the party but passed off my keys to a friend who only smoked a little weed.11:30 PM:  Get back to friends place, figure why not test our 4-HO-MET. There's 4 of us, and since I was the one who bought it I figured I'd take the biggest dose measuered out.  I hand them all 9-11mg pills, and I take the 14mg baggy (I ran out of pill caps, so I just poured it into a baggy with powdered suger).  I down what's in the baggy, making sure I get it all by mixing it with water and drinking it.  One of my friends takes a pill, and the other 2 wait to see what effects are shown first.11:40 PM: I'm starting to feel it.  Colors are starting to intensify and the ground appears to be 'bubbled'.  I feel nausious and sit down.11:45 PM: Oh boy.  I think I might have overdosed.  I start to freak out when it gets kind of heavy to breathe.  I warn my friends of this, and I attempt to purge my system by puking unsuccessfully.  I just want to go to bed and not be drunk/high anymore.  I put on my music and hope for the best.11:55 PM: It's only been 25 minutes? Holy hell. My friend who took the pill still isn't feeling anything, although he is a bit high from the weed.12:05 AM: I'm starting to see a lot of visuals.  I'm not nausious anymore at all.  I tell my 3rd friend this and he takes his cap.  We go on facebook and talk to a girl.  I don't remember any of this, I'm too busy lying on the seemed-to-be comfortable cement floor, laughing my ass off at a can of peace tea.  12:1? AM: My friends start to feel the MET.  We go into the bedroom, where my friend has a blacklight and glow-in-the-dark stars on the ceiling.  Woo-hoo!12:20 AM: We convince my 4th friend to take his pill.  The shapes of the stars can't keep a constant size.  The blacklight is amazing.  Regular light seeping into the room appears orange, beautiful.12:40 AM: I am in complete and utter awe.  I'm amazed at my body features.  I've been laughing so hard and been in so much awe that tears have started to form.  For some reason I rub them all around my face and exclaim about all the fluids falling out of my eyes.  I feel my teeth and start making out with my fingers.  The shirt I was wearing that was a size too small felt like it couldn't contain me.  The plain white towel hangning on the door looked as though Yoshi was printed on it.  I walked up to the Soviet flag hanging on the wall and entered the USSR, while my friends explored the galaxy.12:50 AM: Effects still going strong.  It feels like it's been days since I washed down the metocin.  Parents are upstairs asleep, so we have to contain our laughter.1:30 AM: Start feel tired, but how could I ever sleep on this awesome drug.  I don't feel a bit drunk anymore.2:30 AM: I'm starting to come down.  I go to the bathroom, which has wooden panels for walls.  In one of the knots, I see a dwarf with a long nose.  He winks at me and I continue to piss.  I look in the mirror and I look like starecat.  My pupils are dilated beyond belief.3:30 AM: Visuals are gone.  Friends coming down, I'm left with a mental high feeling, like weed.  Friends are down in a matter of minutes, we decide to go to bed.4:00 AM: Can't sleep, so we talk a bit.5:00 AM: Finally catch some sleep.5:50 AM: Friend #4 (took it last) finally falls asleep.11:00 AM:  My God, I look like a train wreck.  I slept in my contacts, eyes deprived of fluids and feel sticky.  Don't know how I'll go home looking like this.12:30 PM:  Drive home, pupils are small now, eyes a bit better.  Mom asks if I'm really hungover, I play it off all cool and just say I slept in my contacts.  Whew.1:30 PM: Still really tired. Go take a nap.4:00 PM: Get up for a bit, well rested.  Finish the day relaxing.Well, that was the extent of my trip.  Hopefully next time we'll do it during the day, and now I know not to mix tryptamines with alcohol.  I regret doing that, feels like I could have had way more out of it.  Next trip we'll do it in a light, relaxing room, maybe outside, and enjoy the trip to its full extent. Today I'll be consuming 1.5mg of lorazepam with a method I've never tried. I'm going to crush up the entire 1.5mg, and put it onto a single-ply (small) square of toilet paper. I of course cut out this small square, roughly 1 inch x 1 inch or so. Then I'll put it in my mouth, and swallow with some orange juice.Around my area, I don't know about others, but this method is often done with ecstasy pills and methadone. It's referred to as “parachuting”. (Northern California)(9:51) T+0:00 – Parachuted 1.5mg of lorazepam. I'm just sitting behind my computer, reading and listening to The Brian Jonestown Massacre. At this point (before the drug has taken effect) I'm having a few knots in my stomach, just anxious to do something, but can't. Today was an interesting day, had to comfort a crying friend, etc. So overall my mood/setting is just, slightly anxious, and bored. Nothing major going on in my mind.(10:15) T+0:24 – Starting to feel a cool feeling along my body, the small knots in my stomach are gone, my muscles are relaxed and I'm enjoying this music.(10:24) T+0:33 – Parachuted .5mg more.(10:51) T+1:00 – A really nice chilled feeling on my skin, kind of like euphoria. Really relaxed. My usual psychomotor agitation has gone down dramatically, if its even there. For me its usually chewing my tongue and moving around my leg. This is a very gentle drug.(11:06) T+1:15 – Very relaxed, I've heard that nicotine may diminish the effect of lorazepam. I'm going to go find out. I was on my way out but noticed some effects that I should report, in case I forget them. Walking is nice, every step feels soft. It's not that I'm unbalanced, it's just a fluid motion. My eyes are starting to become slightly lazy, and in the mirror I look very satisfied. Effects are good. But, my dog needs walking.(11:39) T+1:33 – Whilst walking my dog I felt that I should also experiment with a few other things. I took 6-7 hits from my pipe, no cannabis, I was hitting the resin. I have a moderate tolerance to cannabis (4-5 bowls a day, high quality). From there I felt the cannabis high was enhanced from the lorazepam. Best way to describe it is the feeling you get in your mouth from a mint, I feel that on my arms and legs. When I got back into the house, I figured that if I drink a small glass of wine, that too can enhance the experience. I know alcohol + benzos usually equal death, but those are severe cases. I'll now slowly consume my wine. (11:51) T+2:00 – I just noticed a sense of warmth and euphoria going over me. The lorazepam still has effects (they don't seem to be diminished by nicotine, although pharmacologically they are, subjectively they aren't (for me). My body is a lot more loose and music is really nice. My balance isn't in good shape. I think I'll wait a few more minutes to make sure I'm in an okay state, then I'll go drink another glass of wine. (12:23) T+2:32 – I measured out 80ml of my wine which is 13.5%. So that means I have 10.8 ml of alcohol in my glass. I finished it in one sip. Currently my cannabis-resin-high has gone down a tad. The psychological effects of lorazepam (relaxtion, no OCD, no anxiety!) are very strong. The minty feeling has gone down a bit. My balance is a little poor, but I can walk a straight line. I'm having very slight vertigo. So far on the Shulgin scale this could be a +2, though I really hate using the Shulgin scale on substances which aren't psychedelic. The effects are definitely here, I can act normal and be fine in front of authority if I needed to, or I could sit here moving my limbs to music and close my eyes to enjoy this euphoria at midnight. My stomach is showing slight disturbance, I have a slight headache that is quickly being killed with the alcohol. My eyes are a tiny bit blood shot and eye lids are droopy.(12:34) T+2:43 – I'm going out for another cigarette, more cannabis resin.(1:00) T+3:09 – I took 6 cannabis resin hits, I drank 10.8ml more of alcohol, smoked one cigarette, and its been 3 hours since I took the lorazepam. The cannabis high has definitely risen, although my euhproia is a very good mix of lorazepam, alcohol, and cannabis. The lorazepam is by no means overpowered by any of the other substances. Each is providing a very unique high. Music is great, I can feel it. My back and sides have a very warm euphoric feeling, yet the top of my head, arms and legs seem to be liking the lorazepam euphoria more. The alcohol is making my stomach feel nice, and head a tad fuzzy. The alcohol is affecting me more than I thought it should (I have a low tolerance, but one nonetheless). As much as I've drank would usually have me at a low buzz. My body is numb. So currently:I think that the interaction of the lorazepam and cannabis provide a very good feel to music, and an extremely pleasant body high. It even feels good to move. My skin has that mint feeling, but slightly. The interaction of the lorazepam with alcohol provide an interesting mix, my balance is definitely off, I can walk a straight line though. My movements are very fluid. The only negative thing I feel is that the fuzziness of alcohol is fucking with the mental effects of lorazepam. I still feel care-free, no worry/anxiety/no OCD, but my thinking is definitely as not as clear as it was with lorazepam.The interaction of lorazepam and nicotine was nice. I enjoyed sitting under the moon at midnight, feeling a fair breeze. I do not think that the nicotine has detracted from the lorazepam. At least not enough to make sure I don't smoke. If that makes sense.All together: I have slight vertigo, no headache, low breathing rate, my pulse is 103/min, my eyes are droopy, bloodshot. My mouth is wet, and everything else on my body is fine.  It's now 1:14, so I'm going to wait a bit and later take more wine, more cannabis.(1:38) T3:47 – The peak of the benzo should be ending soon, then the come down. I at this time drank 1 tablespoon of Nyquil, which is 15mg of dextromethorphan, and 6.5mg of doxylamine. This is a low dosage, I know, but considering I've drank more than 20 ml of alcohol, and 2mg of lorazepam, I'm hoping it'll have some synergy effect, and if its at a low enough intensity I'll take another dose.Right now my blood pressure is 117/70, pulse 84. So my pulse lowered along with everything else. I think its safe to consume 2 more doses of DXM/Doxylamine. And 5 mL of alcohol. I'll also go smoke a cigarette.(2:58) T+5:07 – I did those 2 doses of DXM/Doxylamine. At 1:38, with 5ML of alcohol at the same time. I went out for a walk, I smoked a cigarette while watching the city from a nearby hill. Then I went to the local store to get a pack of cigarettes. I got back just now at 2:58 and took 2 doses of DXM/doxylamine. Now I'm sitting behind my computer again, typing.Well... very strong body high. It's kind of like the DXM high, but minty and my balance is completely off thrown. I saw some blue lights flying around, and I'm have moderate vertigo. I smoked like 3 cigarettes before I got back. (3:08) T+5:17 – Lorazepam is wearing off, I can barely feel it. The resin cannabis finally overpowered it. The alcohol effects are there minus the euphoria, which currently is a mix of lorazepam, cannabis, and DXM/doxylamine. I'm getting a tad drowsy, my stomach isn't feeling that good, (its fine, but small gurgles in there). I'm starting to feel a tad weak, I'm experiencing ataxia too.(3:22) T+5:29 – It hit me fast. I'm really tired right now, I might go to bed or I might lay here for awhile, regardless, farewell reader. I'll finish this tomorrow. Horrible dry mouth.The next day I was slightly tired, and my stomach hurt a bit. This experience wasn't one to repeat, it was accidental. I started out wanting to just see if smoking cigarettes lowers the effects of benzos, but ended up doing a lot more than I originally planned. But, in the end, I learned that....they don't lower the subjective effects. (I did it so you don't have to)Drugs: 1.5mg Lorazepam  at  T+0:00.5mg Lorazepam  at  T+0:336 hits of Cannabis Resin  at  T+1:332 cigarettes  at  T+1:33small glass of wine (13.5%)  at  T+1:3310.8mL of Alcohol  at  T+2:326 hits of Cannabis Resin  at  T+3:09 10.8mL of Alcohol  at  T+3:091 cigarette  at  T+3:09 15mg of Dextromethorpan  at  T+3:476.5mg of Doxylamine  at  T+3:475mL of Alcohol  at  T+3:4730mg of Dextromethorphan at T+5:0713mg of Doxylamine at T+5:07 Around the start of the sixteenth century the Swiss physician Paracelsus wrote 'I possess a secret remedy which I call laudanum and which is superior to all other heroic remedies'.According to an article by Sir William Osler, 'A significant advance in opium-processing occurred in the sixteenth century. In freebase form, the alkaloids found in opium are significantly less soluble in water than in alcohol.'Laudunum [literally: 'something to be praised')is simply a tincture of Morphine in alcohol.Obviously not many have a chemistry set to make a true batch of laudanum but this simple kitchen recipe comes pretty close. Now, since I am a chronic pain sufferer who used to be hooked on oxy's and norcos I have to say that this has been a very good alternative to ordering pills online and/or copping dope on the street. I even used this stuff to detox from methadone once. Albeit a small habit, (20 mls a day)It can make me nauseus and will give me withdrawal symptoms if I suddenly stop but its nothing taking some valerian and/or kava won't help. If you are in pain and either cannot or will not take meds, or do dope, this recipe works fairly well. If you are trying to detox this stuff helps. If you're just trying to get high between fixes....good luck.Anyway here it is: Keep in mind this recipe is for poppy SEEDS ONLY as I have no experience with the pods.1. 1.5 lbs of bulk poppy seeds. (Papaver somniferum)2. 1 lemon or lime.3. 2 12oz bottles of some kind of pale ale 4. quart size or larger french coffee press(it really doesn't matter what kind of alcohol I use. I like pale ale because it blends nicely with the poppy seed and lime plus has enough alcohol content to get the job done. Also, the colder the mixture the better as warm fluid seems to only extract the oil making my stomach hurt. Adding any alcohol stronger than sake just makes the nausea more apparent.)So here's what I do:1. add seeds to french press to 1 inch from top2. slowly add alcohol and one lime using a chop stick or butterknife to mix it well. You will need just over one beer or 14 ozs for the standard press.3. cover seeds with liquid and let sit for 10 minutes stirring frequently.4. put top on press just to hold the seeds back, then pour into a clear glass. It's barely going to drain but just be patient and it should fill a tall glass. It should look yellow/brown.Experience will vary according to strength and quality of the seeds as well as however big one's dope/pill habit is.  Start with that first batch, wait at least an hour and if you need to, resoak and drink the original seed batch before the next. There will still be a significant amount of good stuff in there. Obviously the more I drink the more I'll feel it. Alternatively, the more I drink, the more likely I am to spin out and puke. Go slowly and work up. Take your time and be patient. PEOPLE HAVE DIED FROM THIS STUFF!!!This is no super awesome buzz but the point is to help with pain and/or withdrawal symptoms. It will definitely warm me up and release some joint tension. It may make me slightly nausea but its a happy trade for WD symptoms. Just lie down and be still. Nausea will pass.Serenity I was at a party with my girlfriend and I did not have any bud, so I bought some synthetics called 'Diamond Dove'. I arrived at the party and I started to drink some vodka. I was drunk and had ran out of alcohol. I wasnt satisfied of how fucked up I was so I took out my Diamond Dove and packed a bowl. I had only taken 2 hits and about 10 seconds later I had felt the following: -my heart beat was 3 beats per second, at 180bpm, 2nd degree hypertension. -I was leaning sideways when walking and all sounds echoed strongly-my vision would pulse everytime my heart beated-my vision was extremely swirly like a horizontal S and moved not stop like a wave.-my reaction time a about 5 seconds -I collapsed on the balcony against the railing and was in aw when looking at        everyone staring at me -many people tried to help me but I kicked them away because I thought they were going to kill me-I was screaming at the top of my lungs 'go away!' -my speech was slurred to where it would only be mumbles and grunts (I was actually trying to say a full sentence)-I had sat on the railing for about 15 to 30 mins-when my girlfriend tried for 15 mins to get me up and to the car so she could help-when I had gotten up I fell again-eventually she got me up and literally was holding my whole body up-I punched her in the face leaving her with a black eye (she told me that the next morning because I did not remember)-I passed out in the car-woke up in the car near my house with my best friend in the drivers seat-I tried with all I had to just move my arm and when I did I threw up from the movement -I got the bed spins in the car and passed out again. - 2hrs had passed and my heart rate had not decreased- I had a seizure (yes a real seizure) and my friend had to help me -they had spent 30 mins to get me out of the car but I would refuse.-stumbled inside and luckily no one was home- passed out on my bed -woke up and I did not remember a single thing (not exaggerating, and my memory had come to me weeks later)The day after that night I had gone out with my friends and smoked more, geeking about what had happened. You can never stop a true stoner from smoking. I am feeling really good right now. Day off, a good afternoon nap, and a really cool infusion I made this morning.The local food co-op sells this wonderful herbal tea with damiana, chamomile, and other natural relaxants and tasties. I put about an ounce of it into my remaining half a liter of bourbon. I heated up a pan of water almost to boiling and placed the bottle (ALWAYS with the lid off to prevent pressure build up in a glass bottle) into the water AFTER turning off the heat. Let it sit there about a half an hour, then took it out as the water was almost cool anyway. Put the lid on once completely cool and shook vigorously. Let sit for 8 hours.About an hour ago, I poured me a man-sized drink (about 100 ml). It tasted pretty good. Next time I will use a smooth vodka so I could taste the tea Better. Still, it made for better bourbon.Right now, I feel GREAT!. No stress, sitting here at the computer, all mellow and relaxed. Feel like nothing in the world could bother me. Not fucked up, not hallucinating, still in a normal reasoning state, but very nice and mellow. SOOOOO much more than my usual 100 ml of bourbon can do for me. This recipe is very highly recommended for anyone who just wants to chill out without getting messed up. July 2009 - 400mg Tramadol, 200/1300mg Propoxyphen 100-650, 1500ml. Cabernet Sauvignon Red Wine / Alcohol41 year old male.  215 pounds.  Exercise / swim once or twice a week.  Drink beer or wine 4-5 days of the week, smoke only on those 4-5 days of drinking.  Past drug use - Marijuana daily from age 17 until 38.  Quite cold turkey three years ago (only after meeting my wife who doesn't smoke).  While she didn't ask that I quit I decided it would be better that I did to better align with her lifestyle.   Have dropped LSD 4 or 5 times, yet 20 years ago.  Enjoyed mushrooms about a dozen times (again, 20 years ago and then grew and used some of my own 10 years ago for just a few trips before having enough.)   Used crank a few times (again 20 years ago) that was fun.  Used cocaine for a few months (about 8 years ago) and quit cold turkey.   Pharms - None ever really.   So in truth drug free for three years plus and if you don't include MJ, 8 years and no opiates for 20 years.So why the hell did I decide to take Tramadol?  Just for fun and two days of hell later I wish I never had. Here's my report in hopes that it will help someone else prevent whatever happened to me.  So I get a wart on my foot from a public pool, have to have it removed so the foot Doctor gives me some Cephalxin (antibiotic) to start taking a few days before the minor surgery.   Then he asked if I am feeling pain which I was and still am, but not so bad that I would take a pain killer for it.   Yet when asked that question the drug enjoyer inside me woke up and realized, I can get some legal pain killers.  Why not, sounds like fun and I don't recall taking any pain killers in years, don't even remember the last time, if ever for that matter.   5 am Monday.  Start out with some red wine while doing email.  I am not supposed to be drinking alcohol with pain relievers as they make them stronger, and I know that.   This could have very possibly been what caused my reaction which we are getting to.   Total wine consumed over 15 hours was (2) 750ml bottles or about 8 large glasses.  Not quite enough to become legally intoxicated.  Introduce the narcotics;1 PM - (4) 50mg (200mg) Tramadol Tablets, (2) Propoxyphen 100-650 capsules (200mg Propoxyphen - 1300mg Acetomenophen)8 PM - (4) 50mg (200mg) Tramadol TabletsThat was Monday.  At the time of this writing it is 11am Wed and it is the first time I can get out of bed and stand up for any length of time, eat without vomiting or be able to sit up at the laptop and stay awake without getting massively dizzy.  I don't know if this was an allergic reaction, near overdose or too much with alcohol but I suspect the alcohol played a strong role.   Here's the timeline; 01:00 pm Monday - Feeling pretty good after having a few glasses of red wine during the morning, securing a bottle of Tramadol (and an accidental prescription to Propoxyphen 100-650 which I returned after taking 2).   Looking forward to enjoying some Tramadol, a legal high at home (or so I thought).  Took 200mg with water and another glass of wine.  02:00 Starting to feel dizzy, certainly no pain as the stoned feeling made me forget that my foot hurt.  Even if my foot hurt I think I could just grin and bear it at this point.  Very heavy sweating. I was pouring sweat so badly that my hair was stuck to my head, shirt soaked, sweat getting in my eyes.   Had to keep a towel handy.  Also started to notice problems urinating as when I needed to go it was just very slow.  While I had not eaten anything yet that day, I was suddenly not hungry, also lost interest in the wine I was sipping and cigarettes became less enjoyable.  All I wanted to do was stare at the computer screen and read something interesting, so I web surfed for about 5 hours.  I was most certainly not feeling any pain at all, do recall laughing a bit in the wonderment of the power of drugs that I can get for such a trivial reason, as stated, I really didn't need these at all. Somehow I totally forgot that I had not eaten breakfast, lunch or dinner.   My wife came home, I showed her what I was taking and she said I should eat and then go to bed in a while.  She also noted how much I was sweating.  08:00pm Looking at the clock I realized that I could take another dose so popped (4) more 50mg tablets, washed these down with a glass of wine, went to the kitchen looking for food and I don't remember much else about the evening other than that. I never did make anything to eat, but my wife tells me I went back into the computer and listened to some of my old ZZ Top, Def Leppard and Pink Floyd music on Youtube.  I do know that around 10pm I was getting some massively clear color and graphic hallucinations with my eyes closed.  I was in complete control over three items on a black void background palate and I could morph the items into any shape or color I wanted to instantly.   I sat the right two items aside as not to complicate matters and to focus all creativity on the primary item.  I then broke it down into basic colors of red, blue, yellow and green coloring the 4 sides of a triangular crystal pyramid, replicated hundreds of thousands of these and piece by piece constructed a model palace (which I had recently seen in real life at Presidential library, which was a gift from the President of Saudi Arabia that I had been impressed with). In addition to the visual hallucinations I also had a feeling of floating, time standing still, great heat (and sweating) and unfortunately the entire time, nausea. 11:00 pm (est) Finally laid down when my wife came to bed.  Still could barely urinate fully.  While I do normally sweat when sleeping, I've never sweated that much in my life.  Soaked the entire bed and pillows.  The main things I can remember was being so glad that my wife was there watching me, because I knew something was wrong, and that nothing felt better to just lay there and sleep, as my legs felt more relaxed than they had ever been in my life.  For much of the night I could feel and hear every breath I took.  While it was not labored or stressful I was worried that I was breathing too loud and might be waking up my wife. I was extremely dehydrated with a throat so dry that it was hard to swallow the constantly needed water.   Tuesday09:00am - Got up to take my wife to work real quick.  Ate a small piece of beef roast (with glass of water) on the way out the door (1st thing I had eaten since Sunday)... Had to use sunglasses to go outside, had to hold the railings on the stairs very hard to keep from falling and I felt dizzy like I was stumbling.  Drove her the two miles to work, came home, went to kitchen to get more breakfast then felt ill and tried to make it to the restroom.  I violently projectile vomited the meat I had eaten 20 minutes earlier, as well as the water.  Could not stand up as I was too dizzy so went back to bed and slept (still sweating) for another 8 hours or so.  05:00pm Woke up still feeling extremely weak, tired, depressed, dizzy and sick to my stomach.   Made a small bowl of pasta at 6pm and ate half of it without vomiting.  When being awake this time, the pain relievers had worn off so much that I could feel the whole full extent of how badly my body felt.  It was worse than the flu, with that overall hurting, weak feeling and I do remember coming down from meth about 22 years ago, and this was worse or as bad as that.   All I could do was go back to sleep.  I was paranoid that maybe I had damaged my liver, I felt agitated and angry at myself, very let down that I was not smart enough to avoid doing something so stupid and I felt I may have scared my wife. But since I could not stand up there wasn't much more to do than go back to sleep.  I didn't understand how I could still be feeling this bad over 20 hours after the last dose, most of those hours all being sleep.  But I went back to sleep.   Wed02:00am.  Realized my wife had come home from work, put a glass of water by me, put away my half eaten food and was laying by me.  Realizing that I was not going to get better if I didn't start eating again, I managed to crawl to the kitchen and eat the rest of my pasta while sitting on the floor.  Extremely dehydrated still I brought a gallon of water back to bed with me and drank as much as I could.  Some luck, the food and water was staying down and I actually started to feel a little better. I felt a little constipated and was unable to pass a bowel.  While soaking in a hot tub of water I discovered that it was not constipation exactly yet the Tramadol seemed to have caused my rectal muscles to tighten up. Relaxing in the hot bath did make it to where I could pass a bowel later.  This seemed to be the same as making it difficult to urinate as if my bladder muscles were too tight, but after soaking in the hot water with Epsom Salt I was able to urinate a little better as well.  3:15 am went back to sleep.08:00 am - When my wife's alarm clock went off she asked how I was doing and I was pleased to report, 'I feel better'.  I can hold food down now, the dizzyness is not entirely gone but I can stand up longer now.  She needs to go to the grocery store tonight and I think I can take her in the car. This will be my first time trying to drive after getting 'better'.   But I still feel really, really bad.   Aside from the trips to the store I don't see getting out of bed much except to eat for the rest of this week. I've cancelled everything I had planned, including the foot surgery, to allow for nothing but bed rest for the next 3-4 days.   09:00 am - I ate a first full meal since Sunday night!   Breaded fish, rice and broccoli with cheese, iced tea and a lot of water.  Two hours later so far so good.   Digestion is working, still too tired to stand up more than 10-15 minutes but the nausea and dizziness are almost gone.  11:00 am.  Start writing report before going back to sleep.  11:53 am.  Finish report.Note - Have noticed an interesting side effect, at least on me.   While I normally have beer or wine and a cigarette after dinner, or larger amounts of beer or wine several times a week, I have not drank alcohol, or smoked, nor wanted any alcohol or cigarettes since this happened Monday.   I just have no desire for either.   Summary - People, this was not worth it at all for a free legal high. If I had any idea at all that I was going to lose a week of my life laying around in bed feeling horrible I would have never taken it. I've been taking paroxetine for about 2 months now. I was diagnosed a few months ago with moderate depression and bipolar type 2. At first, it was great. I felt invincible, manic, energetic. The feeling was awesome. But, like any drug, my body became tolerant, and I went back to being my old self again. The difference this time was, I noticed that I felt continuasly stoned, and lost a part of me, the part that actually enjoyed the few things in life that I once enjoyed. It was like I had lost feeling to my soul. So, I started drinking more, and smoking more marijuana, and would notice myself fall deeper in the whole. My relationship with my girlfriend started to deteriorate. I stopped seeing my friends. I lost the ambition and drive at work. I lost the desire for intamcy, and any activities I once enjoyed.But I think the worst thing that happened was this recent weekend. My girlfriend and I had gotten in a fight on a Saturday. I was extremely rude and mean to her (something that I never was to anyone, especially her). So, I went to a party, had a few beers and came home. I had taken my dose later in the day (I usually take it in the morning) and felt a little out of it. So, it was around 10:00 pm. and we got into a fight. All of a sudden, I'm on the floor, in my bedroom, on my knees, crying uncontrollably. She was comforting me. Apparently, what had happened was, I was sitting on my stairs, and started to bang my head real hard on the wall. At this point I started to walk upstairs, mumbling incoherent words, and when my girl tried to walk in the bedroom where I was, I was slamming the door trying to keep her out. I had some sort of mental breakdown and I blacked out!!! I've had a headache for a few days now, and a huge bump on the side of my head. Well, I'm continuing to take the paroxetine, and I feel okay now... I've been having re-occurring thoughts of suicide, followed by major depression in the past few weeks. I don't know what's wrong with me, but I'm beginning to think it's the paroxetine. I began taking Naltrexone 5 weeks ago to enable me to moderate my consumption of alcohol. I have been a 2 bottle of wine a day drinker for the past three years. I am trying method whereby an alcoholic takes naltrexone one hour prior to drinking. The drinker still gets a ‘buzz,’ but over a period of time – generally 3-5 months – the opiate receptors in the brain become ‘unwired’ from addiction. This is supposed to result in the drinker being able to moderate, or halt, their drinking. My own experience has been: For the first week or two, I was more fatigued than usual. Shortly after taking the Naltrexone I experience prickling of my lower extremities. On occasion, within the first half hour of ingestion, I get what feels like a low sugar experience – weak, sweating, somewhat dizzy and disoriented. This is relatively mild and passes in 15-20 minutes. Within a short time I’m back to normal. I intend to eat a high protein meal before taking the med to see if that helps.So far I have not experienced the flat, listless or depressed feelings reported elsewhere. In fact, the opposite is true. I’m already drinking significantly less than I did when I started, down to an average of 6 glasses of wine per day, as opposed to my previous 10-12 glasses. I wake up feeling more alert and ready for the day. I’ve had one day with no drinking at all – and didn’t miss it. On the days of no drinking, naltrexone is not taken. So while I do have some negative side effects, they are nothing in comparison with the side effects of heavy, persistent abuse of alcohol.

I tried taking half a tablet the first night, as instructed. They worked extremely well but I awoke the next morning feeling extremely hung over. So I decided to stop taking them. I had the bottle sitting in my bedside table until one night in the early summer when I was out drinking and partying. I had drinking quite a bit, about 3/4 a liter throughout the night. Finally at about 1:30 am I decided to go home and go to bed. I got home brushed my teeth and changed into my pajamas and went to bed. Unfortunately I had forgotten that I took one of my brothers Ritalin (60 mg's) for work earlier that day. I lay awake for about 30 minutes trying to fall asleep until I had a 'great idea'. I remembered that I had a few remeron in my bedside table. Since I was decently intoxicated I didn't have very good judgment so I decided to take the whole bottle. That's where my story begins:(2:30) Decently intoxicated, just took 215 mg's of remeron tablets.(2:45) Feel a bit drowsy, don't know if its from the booze or remeron.(3:00) I tried to go upstairs to get something to eat. I only made it to the couch before falling over and getting extremely confused.(3:15) Stumble back in bed not really caring about anything. Suddenly I get this extreme euphoric feeling. Similar to xanax except more physically exhausted.(3:20) I can't move. I'm frozen solid in a dream like state similar to ambien except way more intense. My lamp is appearing to melt and the walls of the room sway with each blink of my eyes. I feel on the enclosed in this frozen world forever. I close my eyes, and suddenly feel connected to my mattress. There is a kaleidoscope of colors. This is where my memory fades.(5:00 p.m. the next day) I finally awake dead state and feel physically and mentally exhausted. I suddenly realize that I work at 5:30 and 'scramble' out of bed. I stumble upstairs and into the shower. I feel like I am straining every muscle in my body just to stay standing. Suddenly I fall over. I finish my shower with much difficulty and realize that there is no way I could go make pizzas at my work. I decided to call in sick. Good thing I did because I was in no state to do anything. I ended up watching TV on the couch until about 10:00 then fell asleep. I awoke the next day at about 10:00 a.m. feeling fine. In conclusion I realize how stupid taking a bottle of sleeping meds and drinking was. I researched their drug interactions with one another and found out I was lucky that I didn't die. In Sweden we all celebrate midsummer's eve, summer solstice, the longest day of the year. Usually we celebrate it by drinking ourselves silly. Personally I dislike binge drinking. I don't get sick very easily, but drinking myself into a stupor is not something I enjoy. But there was this one night when everything went a bit out of hand.I was down in the south of Sweden with my now ex-girlfriend, whom I'll refer to as B, and her brother, F. We were just hanging out in the countryside doing nothing, so when midsummer's eve came around and we were invited to a party in a nearby town we became real eager to go. F is a habitual hash smoker, and had brought with him his entire stash of really high-grade hash and a few nice buds of skunk weed. A few nights before midsummer's eve we had shared a joint of his most powerful gear. This might have influenced the events which follow.At midsummer's eve we brought with us one bottle of white wine for me, a bottle of vodka for us three (me, B and F) to share, and F brought a lot of hash and some buds. I can't really remember the night in any kind of chronological order, which is normal for me when drunk, but I think we started off just drinking wine and relaxing to some good music. Smoking a joint in the house where the party was at was out of the question, so we just kicked back and waited for an opportunity to present itself. Me and B finished the wine and started mixing our vodka with 7Up and lime.F disappeared upstairs with some girl, which made me a bit disappointed since I had been looking forward to smoking a joint soon. I thought he'd be gone for the rest of the night. Maybe an hour later I popped outside for a cigarette and sat down to watch some people practice fire spinning (poi) in the back yard. Suddenly F materialised by my side.'You wanna smoke a cocktail?' he asked with a goofy smile.I went inside and got B, and we ran across the street to the parking lot behind a hostel there. F mixed us a cocktail, a combination of weed and hash, and we started smoking. I had never done something so potent before. I choked constantly on the thick grey smoke. After two puffs my lungs started to feel like two bars of molten lead. Then it hit me. In an instant my mouth turned bone-dry, I lost every semblance of depth perception and my head started spinning. I had brought with me a huge cup of 7Up and vodka, and it tasted so good. It was the most amazing thing I'd ever tasted.I drank all of it as fast as I could. Mistake number one. There was a lot of vodka in there. F roached the joint (he had smoked maybe two thirds of it by himself) and we headed back to the party. By then everybody in there was blind drunk, so we fit in perfectly.This is where stuff really went wrong. I mixed up another drink, severely misjudging the amount of vodka I put in it. I drank it down in one big, thirsty gulp and proceeded to seek out some munchies. Meanwhile, F was chilling in the back yard watching the fire spinners, and B was lying on her back in a walk-in closet, tripping off the cocktail. After a couple of handfuls of tasty peanuts the alcohol hit me like a freight train. My head spun like some crazed gyroscope. It was hard even to stand up. My legs just wanted to fold themselves, my arms were out of control. Strangely enough I was completely unafraid. My body was messed up beyond recognition but my mind felt clear and sober.I staggered to the bathroom and slumped down over the toilet bowl. However I willed myself I couldn't throw up. Since I rarely need to I've never learned how to induce vomiting by sticking your fingers down your throat. But in the fugue state the cocktail had put me in I could visualize it, a clear vision of my mouth and my throat from the side, and where my fingers should go.It worked like a charm. After cleaning myself up and drinking maybe a litre of water I left the bathroom and met B and F who had been looking for me. Together we staggered to a bus station to catch a bus home. Along the way I threw up several times. Normally I hate doing that, but in the state I was in I didn't care. It didn't feel good or bad, it just happened. The bus ride home was completely uneventful. I think I must have fallen asleep. Getting off the bus and walking home left me feeling almost sober. When I woke up the next day I wasn't even that hung over. Just a little lethargic and clumsy.I wouldn't consider it irresponsible that I drank so much alcohol that night. It was more of a mistake. I didn't stop to think at all, I just kept on rolling. Not meaning to sound like a cliché, but marijuana is an introspective tool for me. After this night I realised that something that some people party on might be something that I'd rather meditate on. I think I'm wired like that. And this midsummer's eve last year really taught me a lesson about how my body works. [Erowid Note: The author reports individual doses summing to 7 shots but submitted with a total dose listing of 200ml, or approximately 4.5 standard shots.] Introduction: I'd like to share with you a story of my first time being intoxicated. No, I did not find intoxication in lysergic acid, or even by smoking weed. I found it in everyday legal alcohol. Vodka to be exact. I feel this experience will open me to a whole new world of chemically altered states of consciences.Set & Setting:It was a raining Saturday night I planned to spend home alone on the computer, possibly talking with friends on MSN. I am 17 at the time. My sister is 23 and fully able to purchase drinks. My mother is planning on heading to my sister's house later to drink and have a good time. I am in a good mood, as my life has recently took a turn for the best in the social department (despite the fact I'm home alone on a Saturday night). I ponder the idea of getting my mother to give me money for some vodka so I too could have an interesting night. I approach her, and she accepts my plea. Soon after, I take my sister to the LC and she buys me 275 Ml of Potter's PP Vodka. I am extremely happy indeed to get intoxicated on this particular night, as I have only gotten tipsy once before.Time of ingestion: I'm in my room with the bottle of vodka, a shot glass, and a picther of orange juice I had just mixed from concentrate that was in the freezer. I am watching celebrity poker, and I am generally entertained. I take 3 large shots of vodka and mix them in with a medium sized glass of OJ. I quickly down it. It tastes like regular OJ that was mixed with shoe polish or perfume. I wanted to get more messed up than I had gotten before. So I mixed another 3 large shots with the same amount of OJ and down it. I wait a few minutes, wandering around my room waiting for something to happen. I had drinken more whiskey before on another occasion and not much had happened. When I drank the whiskey it was over the period of an hour. When I was drinking the vodka, I had little idea that how fast I ingested it had an influence on the effects. Time of ingestion + 20 Minutes:I am now downstaires on my computer talking to some of my friends. I start to realize that my head is spinning, and I could be in for a ride. As I talk aloud to my friend out loud, I tell them what I feel. Soon I am having the time of my life just bobbing my head to the sound of the music I have playing (dj tiesto). Time of ingestion + 30 Minutes:I try to walk around my house. I walk by my living room and notice there are at least 4 people sitting on the couches watching TV. By this time, I feel as if I can't remember what happened 3 seconds earlier. As if I was some sort of fighting fish. I walk by my living room a few more times trying to figure out who is watching TV. Soon I realize it's my neighbours Evan & Danielle. I am happy because these neighbours are generally nice to us. I figure they are probably waiting for my mother, so they could head out to my sister's house for a fun evening. Time of ingestion + 35 Minutes:I am now having a blast walking around in circles in my house. My sister interceptes me in the kitchen and asks me if I am drunk. I can't hide it. I am indeed intoxicated. For the next few minutes I ramble to my mom and my neighbours that I would be fine if they went out, and that I'm almost 18 anyway. My mother doesn't want to leave me alone. My mother's boyfriend soon brings McDonalds home, and I have a wonderful time with my brother trying to eat it. I remember rubbing french fries on my face at one point. I also vaguely remember my friend Courtney calling me on the phone asking if she could come over, and me yelling at her not to (I bet I would have had intercourse). Time of ingestion + 60 Minutes: By this time my mother had left, and now Evan, Danielle, and my brother are home with me taking care of me and we are watching Americas most wanted. I remember having a blast just talking and letting myself be completely unmoderated. My neighbour Evan is the cool type of guy, and I consider myself to be slightly antisocial. I remember he kept asking me question about life, girl, drugs, and so on. And I kept answering them with ease. I was having a great time just sitting there watching them play PS2, and talking to Evan and his attractive girlfriend. I felt as if I was unmoderated. If there were girls my age there, I would have been a pimp. I felt I could say anything. Make fun of people, talk about having sex with celebrities, ANYTHING. I also take one more shot at this time, but I end up spilling my OJ all over the floor. It made my tummy hurt too.Time of ingestion + 2 Hours:The buzz has for the most part left my body. I am writing this at the 2 hour point. I am making few typing errors by I do still feel as if I have a slightly altered memory and personality. Conclusion:I have underestimated the strength of alcohol. I now have respect for the effects of it. Although I am embarrassed that it took such a little amount to get me wasted. I am excited on getting drunk again and eventually exploring other altered states with other drugs. Have fun. Dear Alcohol,  We've known each other for quite some time now. I first met you when I was 13, but we didn't hang out that much and I didn't think you were as cool as people said you were. I definently liked my friend pot better. My friend pot got me sent away to boarding school, and I thought that that was bad, but I didn't know how shitty shit could get. You are such an asshole. Everybody thinks that we shouldn't be friends and I dont think so either, but I just can't let you go. In the past 6 months you have gotten me kicked out of an apartment, a hostel, a hotel, and my own home. I have lost friends,am about to lose my family, all for you. You just wont leave me alone. When I'm not hanging out with you, all I think about is hanging out with you even though I hate you so much. I went to New Jersey twice to get away from you and I just came back. Next time I went farther. I went to Memphis, Tennessee just to get away from you, but I missed you so much I just came back. I went to Colorado thinking my life would change, but the problem with you is that you're everywhere. When I watch TV, I see people hanging out with you and I get jealous. When I talk to my friends, they all say how cool you are and I get mad. When I read a magazine, I see pages saying how EVERYBODY should be your friend. But I'm sick of you now. I know I said that before but I cant take it any longer. Tonight, I have to look for a place to stay because of you- because not only have you terrorized me, you've terrorized my father and his father at the same time and they cant stand me being friends with you. Im sorry, friend, enemy, but its time for me to move on. I want you to know that you're the worst thing thats ever, EVER, happened to me and I'm finally letting you go. If I never see you again in my life, I will be a happy man, but I know I will. And when that day comes, dont bother to come talk to me, dont even fucking look at me because I will not look back and I will not even acknowledge you. The worst thing is that I know you'll always be around. You've been around long before I was born and you'll be around long after I die. I'm done, good bye. I woke up in the hospital this morning, after taking approximately 15mg of 5 MeO DMT and drinking quite a few beers (like 9 ish). We'd been drinking for about 4 hours, just back from the bars and the topic of drugs came up. All of us have a fondness for psychedelics, and one of my friends mentioned he had 5 MeO DMT. My other friend is a chemist, and has produced other drugs in the past, so he immediately became curious. I'd never heard of it, but they described it as being like salvia but stronger and slightly longer lasting. M really advised us against trying it while we were so hammered, but G was pretty persuasive. They weighed out about 45mg, and I divided it up into two lines on a piece of paper. One was about a third of the dose, and I took that one. The other 30mg, G snuffed up. The onset was quick, and we went out to the front porch (why I don't know). G laid down on the front stoop and started moaning. I was enjoying the interesting glow about the shadow cast from a lattice, but when I tried speaking to him, nothing came back. I knew things were going wrong when I asked him if he was ok, and he told me 'No.'From there things happened exceptionally fast. I ran around to check him out and his eyes were rolling into the back of his head. For some reason, I ran into the house (to get help from our other passed-out friend), and when I came back out, G was seizuring on the ground. I immediately got down and tried to hold him still and put his head on my lap. I was yelling, 'HEY. HEY!! Stay with us man! HEY! Look at me, talk to me buddy!'Then he stopped seizuring, his eyes rolled into the back of his head, and his neck went limp. I couldn't find a pulse. As far as I knew, my friend just died in my arms. Even completely sober, this would be a terrifying experience, but in the middle of a powerful dose of 5 MeO DMT, it was absolutely horrifying. I stood up. M was already on the phone with 911. I felt completely drained. All I could think about was about how sad this was. His life over, my life completely destroyed. I started walking up the street, in a haze of the most profound sorrow I'd ever experienced. I kept thinking about all the decisions that had led to this point, how every one of them contributed to my arrival here and now. I really wanted to talk to my mom, and I was calling her furiously (but having a lot of trouble operating the touch screen on my phone).That's when the fear set in. Suddenly I thought I needed to run and hide, that the police were coming for me. I ran into a neighbors side yard, and stooped behind a bush. As I waited to hear what people were doing, I lost any awareness of what was going on and where I was. I was having trouble remembering what was happening, what I was supposed to be doing. I thought I saw a cop car drive by (which may be true, they arrived around that time), and I thought they were looking for me. I sat, waited, and forgot.When I walked out, I heard someone say 'Hey, are you ok? Do you need help?' It was one of my neighbors. His voice, soft and calm, made all the difference in the world.'Yeah. I do. I think I just saw my friend die. He was in my arms on the patio. We took some bad drugs, and he had a seizure. This is the worst night of my entire life.''Oh my god. That's horrible.' I could feel his empathy. He was very reassuring. 'You should go be with him. He would want you there. You'll regret it your entire life if you don't. You really need to go back to him.'He was right and I knew it. I started walking back down to my house, maybe 100 yards away. There were tons of emergency responders, and a fire truck was pulling off. I walked in to find two police officers and a couple paramedics talking to my friends in the living room. They were waiting for me, and I sat down and talked to them on the couch. G hadn't died. He was stable and they'd taken him to the hospital. They were concerned about me, and I was clearly pretty shaken up. I told them I didn't think I needed to go to the hospital, so they packed up and told us to keep our cell phones on. Almost as soon as they left, I felt nauseous and ran outside to throw up. For some reason I went around to the apartment that's attached to the house, and started yelling for my friend that lived in there. 'We took bad drugs. G died, and I'm not doing so well,' I told her. Of course she flipped out, while I started throwing up all over the yard. I started yelling for the paramedics.'HEY! I need help! HEY!' brought a flashlight from the front of the house.'Are you ok? Do you want to go to the hospital?''YES. I'm not ok.' I told them. They helped get me to the front of the house while another paramedic was dispatched. They started checking me out. I was throwing up and mostly unresponsive, but I was able to climb into the ambulance. My friends watched as I drove off.Once we got there, I calmed down significantly. I was sobering up and feeling really stupid for everything. They still gave me a shot of Ativan to calm me down (I kept asking them for thorazine, don't know why...). Not long after that, I passed out.When I woke up, I could see the contempt on the faces of the staff. They thought I was pretty dumb, and they were right. About the only thing I did right was hold my buddy's head up while he was seizuring. G was in a room around the corner, and he was fine. We both were discharged about the same time, and we walked back to my house a few blocks away. We did a lot of dumb things that night, not the least of which was taking a really powerful compound while we were drunk. Someone easily could have died or had serious, permanent complications. Some lessons (notes to myself):-Know what you're taking. I had no idea how serious this drug was, so I was completely unprepared for its effects. -Don't mix drugs and alcohol. I'm usually so good about this rule, but this one time really cost me. (To the tune of the $600 medical/amblance bill I get to pay). -Have someone that can help if things go wrong. My friends being mostly sober and not on the drug I was on were critical to making this a story with a happy ending.-BE CAREFUL WITH DOSAGE!!! I can't stress that enough. My roommate has a good scale that measures very small weights pretty damn accurately, but if you don't know how much you're supposed to be taking, it won't do you much good. Be sure, start small, and be extra cautious the first time you take something.-Just because it's legal doesn't mean it won't get you really messed up. -Be prepared. Take precautions. It's important.  DOSE: 5 glasses oral Alcohol - Beer/Wine \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0  smoked Amanitas - A. muscaria (dried) \\xa0 \\xa0  smoked Products - Other Cannabis-Like Smoking Blends \\xa0 \\xa0 \\xa0  oral Amanitas - A. muscaria (dried)            BODY WEIGHT:   280 lb         I had purchased an ounce of Amanita muscaria at a local headshop about a month ago.  I had just been waiting for the right time and place to experience them as I know the importance of set and setting.  However, upon reading a few reports of smoking the skin, I decided that it would be a good way to test them out.  So a few hours after MSU lost the Final Four game to Butler, I gave it a shot.  I was already pretty buzzed at this point; having drank about 5 beers over the course of the game.  I know this contributed to me having the balls to smoke mushrooms just a few hours before my wife would be home but I knew I could just go lay in bed and enjoy my trip if need be.  The process was as follows:  I peeled a 2cm x 2cm piece of the red skin off the cap.  I rolled it up into little balls and filled my pipe.  I smoked it all gone and felt no major effects, other than increased salivation.  I then decided to smoke a little K2 (that I had around to avoid dropping dirty on drug tests) hoping that it would calm my stomach in case of nausea.  I used a different pipe for this but for some reason the smoke tasted just like cinnamon sugar.  I still felt nothing after that so I decided to go ahead and eat the small piece of Amanita that I had peeled the skin off of.  About an hour later I found myself defecating and constantly reminding myself that I wasn't going to die.  For some reason I had a nervous thought in the back of my mind that I was going to die.  So I decided to drink some water and lay down for a while and try to go to sleep.  The negative vibe continued and although I had no nausea whatsoever, I had the urgent sensation of vomit pulsing up my throat and lots of mucus collecting in my sinuses.  The water helped stop the vomit sensation and I rode the trip out successfully without purging.  The trip was very very weird though.  Unlike nothing I've experienced.  I saw a few scary faces on my ceiling but decided to close my eyes and try to sleep instead because of the negativity.  I must have fell asleep soon because the next thing I remember was waking up to my wife coming to bed and when I opened my eyes everything was fine. I was an honor student all throughout high school, and even made Dean's several times in college.  I would someday love to try ibogaine, mushrooms, or lsd less for euphoria and more for personal transcendence.  I have always been a fan of pills; I think they're amazing.  After reading Daniel Pinchbeck's Book, '2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl' my ideas about consciousness have changed from a quantum physics view to a view that it trying to tie all these things together.  It's possible to take a tablet and feel completely different emotions and sensations than the dull tedium of daily life?  I'm in.  Please note, this is something I partake in rarely, I have a great life and I do not ever drive under the influence of any substances.T=0  Early in the day, at about 9:30, I had a half pint of clear Bacardi (just under 8 shots) with organic juice.  This was before I had taken any pills.  I am prescribed Wellbutrin, but I did NOT take my dose this morning due to interactions with alcohol causing seizures and blackouts.  I also had a 'Function' brand soft drink called 'Vacation,' their coconut/island flavor containing 5-htp, L-theanine, Magnesium, and Zinc. I also took a multivitamin.T+2:00I chose to take 1mg of Clonazepam to heighten the experience.T+2:30 I'm feeling pretty silly but a bit too mellow.  I decide to take 3mg of Ativan (Lorazepam) and 1200mg of Provigil (Modafinil) because I had read on some forums that this may cause euphoria at such a high dosage.T+2:50: Definitely a little light headed as I walk to the bathroom, but no dizziness or discomfort.  It's a floaty, cloudy, confident feeling. T+3:00: My head is fuzzy, but so far no unpleasant affects whatsoever.  I'm totally comfortable just hanging out on the couch and watching some daytime TV.  This is most likely a reflection of the benzos and alcohol, although I can feel the Bacardi had less of an influence than before: fine by me, I like the pills.T+4:30I'm currently focusing very hard on this report, tweaking details in case some of our readers may be seeing this and in need of more explanation.  I'm currently spell and grammar checking, almost obsessively.  That isn't how I wanted this to go.  I blame the Provigil (Modafinil) that causes inspiration to work.  Modafinil (Provigil) seems to motivate me more at this level than at the 200mg dose.  My Blood Alcohol Reading is 0.10. I decide to take a shower.T+5:00Out of the shower and styling my hair, putting on makeup. I'm feeling a little more pleasantness with a no real clumsiness, but a small lack of coordination felt.  This combo is not some thing I would try while at the family reunion.T+5:30I feel quite mellow, calm, and content.  My brain seems to have developed a short-term memory difficulty in such that I've been wandering around in my room looking for a set of jewelry I had wanted to wear... and then forgot, so I walked out of my room half naked, and now am sitting on my couch.  I live alone, no worries.  I checked my blood alcohol level and it's down to .07, since that BAL reading is considered sober enough to drive a NASA spacecraft (teehee) I'm pretty sure most of the rest of the report, I expect, will be due mostly to Ativan (Lorazepam), Klonopin (Clonazepam), and Provigil (Modafinil).At this point I had decided to visit a local jewelers store and walk around the park.  It was cold but I was feeling good.  When I got back home, boyfriend had found this trip report saved on my computer, so there was a little fight, but I still probably feel more optimistic about the mild argument, I was honest with him and he eventually wasn't mad anymoreT+ 5.50 Still calm after the fight, but feeling pretty down because of the argument, through no fault of the substances. We ended up going to the grocery store, where I was sick.  After coming home, I’ll I wanted to do was to lie down. I’m still feeling a bit slow and floppy from the benzos, and have not experienced and euphoria due to the large Modafinil dose.At this point, I believe the recreational effects have ended. A story about how my mind went on a vaction to Fairyland. Well me and some friends of mine decided out of nowhere to take a trip up to Vancouver from Boise Idaho (9 hour drive), we left Friday night and had to come back Sunday, it was a stupid Idea. I was recently put on Adderall for ADD, so I made the drive in one night. I was taking about 1 pill (20 mg) every six hours or so.After my friends all went to sleep, and I was still speeding, wandering around the neighborhood and watching tv, we decided to start drinking. It should have been real fun, since we were all 19, it would have been our first time legally drinking. I popped 2 of my Adderall, 2 ibuprophen because my knee was really hurt cuz of an accident I had a week ago, drank .5L of a 40 proof coconut flavored rum I bought, and .375L of southern Comforts 80 proof. [Erowid Note: 23 shots of hard liquor is considered an extremely high dose.  I'm no light weight so I figured this would be enough to get me pretty drunk but not too drunk.We were trying to figure out where we were gonna go, then suddenly we were in a cab going to see some fire works.  I didn't think much of the rapid change in locations at the time.  I was feeling pretty odd watching the fireworks but didn't notice anything unusual.  Then we went to a club, I ordered a couple mix drinks while we were there, a double 151 and cokend a double long Island Ice tea in the course of like 20min.We left the club because it sucked, and then the scariest thing of my life, I came too in a holding cell. I didn't know where I was, and was sitting in my boxers with my pants on the floor.  It was about 9am, my friends eventually showed up and got me. My friends filled in the details of the night.Before we went to the fireworks, we went to a very fine restaurant, I drove and was not acting drunk at all [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] , in the restaurant I flipped over my plate of food, with everything still on it and said somebody told me to do it. I was rambling on about elves being real and described a scenario of a world based on a book I just read a couple days before, insisting that it was all true and I was from there, but still not acting drunk besides my crazy talk. Then around the time of the fireworks I was acting normal.After the club we went back to the hotel room, and I was asking the cabby all sorts of crazy questions, about his religion and stuff.  Then at the hotel room I kept rambling on about this imaginary world of elves and magic as if it was real, and I was from there.  They also said I was acting kinda paranoid, hiding the liquer botles so sombody wouldn't find them and get us in trouble.  They gave me some more liquer hoping that I would get drunker and pass out.  One of my friends, decided to through water on me and all I did was stare him down and put my cigerette out on my shirt.  Then I wanted to leave and go somewhere, after trying to stop me with words and force, they finally let me leave.  I don't know what happened from there on, but a cop picked me up and brought me in for my own good.  They said I was puking and pissing everywhere and asking about the room, and acting like somebody slipped me something.Besides the crazy talk and the puking at the end of the night, I never acted drunk.  Never stumbled, my speech while crazy wasn't slurred or anything.  I may have taken more Adderall or ibuprophen, I don't remember.  As it is I can't find my bottle of Adderall so I'm gonna have to go another couple weeks w/ out any.I've never acted like that before, so I have to beleive that it was something of a combination between the drugs I took and the lack of sleep.  I've mixed Adderall and alcohol before and nothing like that happened, and I've stayed up for a week straight on Adderall before and while I got a little paranoid nothing like this happened.It actual seems kind of interesting, I might try to duplicate the experience under more controlled circumstances and get a video tape of myself.  It seems like the alcohol was a catalyst for something in the Ibuprof and addy mixture, the blank spots in my memory and the psychosis all come on at the same time about half an hour after I drank something.It wasn't fun, and I wouldn't suggest this to anyone. I’d like to briefly recount an experience I had with combining kava kava and alcohol one night last weekend, because I had an unusual and kind of frightening reaction.  I have used kava kava many times in the past, and had used it every evening for the past two weeks prior to this experience.  My normal dosage is between one and two compacted tablespoons of dry kava root powder that I buy at a local grocery store.  My preparation is very simple: I put the powder in about ¾ of a bottle of regular tap water, shake vigorously for a few seconds, and chug it while the sediment has not yet settled.  This is very effective for me at inducing relaxation, anxiolysis, and sometimes a bit of euphoria.  On the night in question I used between 3 and 4 tablespoons because I was going to a party and wanted to be very loose.  About 90 minutes after ingestion of the kava, I started drinking beers.  I had 4 beers over about another 90 minutes, and was hanging out, talking with some friends, when G told me that my face was red.  I didn’t really take notice, because that happens sometimes when I have alcohol by itself.  When I looked in the mirror, it was indeed VERY red, but in small patches.  The “rash” was not itchy or raised, but splotchy and pretty disgusting looking.  I asked the host of the party for some benadryl and I took them and got a ride home.  When I got home about 45 minutes later, I took off my shirt and the red, irregularly shaped splotches were on my face, neck, shoulders, chest, and upper back.  I felt fine (though quite sleepy from the benadryl and alcohol) and when I woke in the morning, the rash was gone.  I repeated this combination once (a week later) but with less alcohol and less kava.  When the rash reoccurred (though less severely) I felt confident in attributing it to the combination of the two. The scattered information I found about yarrow piqued my curiosity: not only is it a very useful medicinal herb, but it allegedly changes the inebriety of alcohol... As I somewhat dislike the ordinary inebriety from alcohol, I decided that I had to see for myself.I sadly cannot come up with neither measurements nor a timeline for my experiment... I prepared my extract by filling a mason jar to the 3/4ths with dried yarrow flowers (bought from an herborist), and I then added vodka to the same height. I kept the jar in my closet for three days, shaking it occasionnaly. When I finally filtered the liquid and transferred it into my flask, I noticed the vodka had become golden and that it had a very strong flowery smell. I would have liked to experiment first by myself, but Halloween was coming up and I was invited to a party. I chose to try the yarrow preparation there and prepared myself, dressed as a droog from Clockwork Orange, with combat boots, white pants and shirt, suspenders, a hat and a cane, and last but not least my special flask by my side and a joint of good cannabis by my heart. I met with another droog (a friend of mine, dressed too in Clockwork fashion; let's call him D) and we went to the party, which was at someone's house (and not at a bar, as it was supposed to). When we got there, I took my first swig of yarrow, and found the taste to be unpleasant but far from unbearable; I wished I had some spearmint-flavoured chewing gum, though. Me and D then each bought a beer and sipped it slowly, visiting the place and meeting some people. After a while, we met another droog, but this one we didn't know! He was very obviously baked, and the conversation we had was quite interesting, as it revolved around Kubrick, Burgess and their work. Our newfound droog handed me the glass of milk he had as part of his costume, saying he did not want it anymore. I simply couldn't resist to the tentation of spiking the milk with my yarrow preparation, making a 'moloko-velocet' of sorts. The milk did nothing to hide the taste, though, and I found myself drinking faster that I would have from my flask to be done with the task of holding a glass earlier. My glass of milk about 3/4ths empty, it took me a while to realise I was drunk, because yarrow lived up to its reputation: I was indeed feeling only the 'lighter' effects of inebriation, and I was still much less exuberant than my friend D, who probably didn't drink as much plain alcohol as I did. I am slightly bigger than he is, but that alone could not make up the difference, I think. I finished my glass of milk after that, and thought nothing more of it.At some point later, D and I went outside to smoke the joint. Strangely, only one person, who we knew from a long time, came to smoke with us, and reluctantly at best. And so we smoked the joint, D and I taking many more hits that the other guy, and as we came back inside it hit me full force. It felt as powerful (but not quite the same) as a third-plateau DXM trip, but was much more functional: I didn't feel as if every muscle of my face was twitching, and I still could walk around. I chose to crash on a couch in a quieter room for a while though, as it was extremely pleasant to just let my drunken-yet-lucid thoughts roll images in front of my eyes. People were starting to mind the weird-guy-nodding-on-and-off I was, so I got up and changed room, but it all gets a bit blurry from that point on. I remember feeling very psychotic, as the physical effects of both alcohol and marijuana were much weaker than usual, making the mental effects seem stronger and sharper; I could spend full minutes staring at people with a Jack Nicholson grin, leaning on a wall, before joining a conversation with random people, including most notably an oddly flask-shaped robot from The Wizard of Oz. I kept moving around and getting back to the couch, but I remember following my friend D to the dance floor at some point. It was quite funny to watch him dance, very out of it, but I decided after a few minutes that he made enough of a fool of himself, and dragged him back to the room with the couches. There, we held conversations with random people again, but I really started to feel tired; I simply closed my eyes and listened to the conversation, placing a comment here and there, for about half an hour. Then, suddenly, I felt the effects of the marijuana tapering off unusually sharply, and got up and running again. At about that point, I realised D was not in any state to be around people, and suggested we called it a night and went back to his place. It took maybe half an hour to convince him to get up and look for his coat, and the moment he got up marked the end of any fun. We searched for his belongings for at least an hour, him unable to remember how they looked like and me not knowing but trying my best, my mind seemingly more lucid than ever. I had to drag him around and suggest to him every thought one would normally have by himself in such a situation, and I had to stop him more than once from buying another beer. He ended up puking, and we got kicked out; we then had no choice but to walk back to his place, without coats (I just didn't bring any) in the quite cold night.D had a very hard time recognizing his neighbourhood, and by chance we met two of his friends on the way back, who directed us to larger streets, from where we could find our way to D's house. I encouraged him all the way by making him sing folk songs with me, and we finally arrived maybe half an hour later. We snuck into his house as quietly as possible (which was, admittedly, not that quietly at all) and went to bed. I am now at home and it is 5:00 P.M. the next day (well, the same day; you get the idea), and I feel quite fine, and I hope D does too, because we're going to the Rocky Horror Picture Show tonight. Oh, how I love the time of Halloween!In short, I found yarrow to be a very interesting plant, and the experience was well worth it. I have found more interest in the alcohol inebriation thanks to this plant, and I will probably further experiment with it, perhaps in a more 'controlled' context though. This is something I noticed more than an actual experience.I was recently put on Celexa for anxiety. Despite the new medication, I wasn't really worried about continuing to smoke marijuana, drink alcohol, or use any other drug. I've always had a pretty average tolerance for alcohol. I'm not a lightweight, but I don't drink so often that I need a ton of booze either.But after my body adjusted to the Celexa (this was only after being on it for a week), I noticed my alcohol tolerance go waaaay down. I had a great buzz on just 3 Mike's Hard Lemonades (5% alc/volume). It probably wouldn't have taken many more before I was really drunk. Some might see this as a bad thing, but who wouldn't wanna get drunk faster if they could? So I recently came down with a temporary (but quite painful) medical condition and got a prescription for Vicodin.  Vicodin never really did it for me so I asked my Mom if she had any other painkillers that would help.  She came over like 30 mins later with a whole bag of goodies.  She brought me one container half full of liquid Dilaudid, 10 2mg Dilaudid pills, 10 10mg Flexeril pills, and 5 20mg Percocet.  During the next couple days, I tried each one (for the pain) and found the flexeril to be the most calming and euphoria-enducing.  The other pills all made me trip more than relax, and I liked that about the flexeril. Anyway, this weekend I decided I was gonna try some flexeril mixed with some other drugs at a party.  My mindset at the time was excited about the graduation party I was going to and energetic.  I also drank an energy drink about an hour before the party.  I got to the party at 9:30 so I'll begin there.I immediately popped two flexeril and chased it down with a beer.  I waited 'till about 10:15 and, still not feeling the effects of the first two pills or the beer, took two more flexeril and drank my third beer.  At this time me and two friends went into one of the houses bedrooms and rolled a joint.  The three of us split it and played video games for a while.  This is when I felt the flexeril hit.  It came on slow at first, as I started feeling very relaxed and comfortable on the edge of the bed.  The colors on the T.V. screen were blurring together and sort of melting into each other.We finished the joint at about 11:00 and got up to get back to the party.  It was so hard for me to stand up, as I was so freaking comfortable sitting there.  I felt very heavy and it was kinda hard to move, but not impossible by any means.  My whole body was kinda tingling numb.  We walked into the kitchen, where we stood and I drank maybe 3 more beers.At this point, it was about 11:50 and the room was starting to move around me.  I knew I was well on my way to drunk, so I contribute that feeling to the beer mostly.  There was, however, another feeling that I can't contribute to the alcohol.  I was standing there with a friend on either side of me in the dining room, facing toward the kitchen.  All at once, the kitchen and all the people and stuff in it seemed to increase in elevation by about 4 feet.  It was like someone had lifted up one side of the house and tilted it to a 5% grade.  It was very hard to stand up straight and I found myself holding onto my friends to stand up straight.We went outside to get some fresh air.  My friends started asking me if I was o.k. and they said I looked weird.  I told them I had taken some pills and they were kinda mad, but then started asking me if they could have some too lol.  I gave a friend 2 of my Oxy's and gave another friend two of my prescribed vicodin's.  I took one more flexeril with them and drank 2 more beers.We went back inside around 1:00 and almost everyone was already asleep (there were about 20-25 people there).  There were still a few people watching T.V. in the living room so I made my way over there.  It was then that I realized how hard the pills had hit me.  It was so hard to walk from the front door through the front room and the hallway and into the living room.  It was maybe 40 feet but it felt like 40 miles.  Visually, everything was a little blurry.  I kept thinking like my eyes were like a video camera and I was taping the party, only I was recording everything like a half a frame slow.  Like if someone moved really fast, I could see like a half a frame of their arm, like a trail.  Wow this is harder to explain than I thought it would be!  Anyway, I sat on the couch and drank another beer and just enjoyed the high.  I was very relaxed but not tired, very happy but not energetic, and overall just felt like all my friends were so cool and everything was just perfect.  I sat there on the couch for maybe an hour or so and then fell asleep.  I woke up the next morning at about 9:30 hangover free.  After returning home, however, I became very very tired.  I slept for a solid 8 hours and awoke feeling refreshed.  I guess thats the flexeril hangover people talk about.Overall it was a very good experience.  I would definitely do it again if I could convince my Mom to give me some more of her pills hehe.  I've heard people say (my Mom included) that flexeril makes them prone to being excited or scared or agitated from small disturbances.  Like one time my Mom was sleeping in her bed, doped up on about 4 flexeril, and I opened the door and entered her room quickly and without warning.  She practically hit the ceiling.  The jumped up out of bed and started cussing at me and her heart was beating like crazy.  Well, I didn't feel any of those disturbing feelings when I was on it.  At one point during this night a fight went down between two guys I didn't really know.  Not only did I not get extra-excited, as you would think, I didn't even get as exicted as I would have if I was sober.  I kinda just stood there and enjoyed the fight hehe.  At first I was worried about mixing the pills with alcohol, but I saw no ill effects from this combination at all. A couple days ago, I arrived at a Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers concert extremely early.  The reason being is that my friend and I were supposed to meet a group of people and throw a nice tailgait party.  Since I arrived before them (and they weren't answering their cell phone), I decided to start the party a little early.  I had plans on trying wormwood without it being in Absinthe (in which I one day aspire to try), so I figured I'd give it a whirl before the others come and condemn me for trying the unknown.  They have always scolded me for trying things they've never heard of.  Anyway, I opened up my bag of wormwood and rolled a decent sized joint.  I was surprised with the first hit because I knew it would be harsh on my throat...but not that harsh.  I passed it on to my friend, and he wossed out after 2 hits.  I continued smoking while he watched and complained that it was so dry.  When I was done, I took a little walk around my car and the other tailgait party that were going on.  My friend and I were offered a beer (I'm 17 and he's 18), so we drank and stayed with the neighboring party until my group decided to show up. This all happened within a half-hour.  I was beginning to feel the effects of the wormwood.  It was extremely pleasant...it has the total body relaxation of weed except it doesn't have the slowness, the paranoia, the stupidity, etc.  I was enjoying it.The rest of the group set up their grill and began cooking food and drank beers, so I went to my car and pulled out a new bottle of Southern Comfort.  I took 2 or 3 big sips, and my friend barely tried it...but acted like it was the best stuff on earth.  A few moments later, I had a nice buzz going on. I had another beer with my food, and then hit the bottle, taking numerous monster-sized sips.  I admit, I am a lightweight drinker because I don't drink too often (I try to keep it that way).  I was confortably drunk and carefree.  As more cars filled the parking lot in, we broke out the joints.  Within those few hours, we passed around 2 or 3 of them.  I was absolutely out of it, I loved it.  It felt like I was numbed both inside and outside.  We walked to the venue and watched Tom Petty perform.  We passed around 2 or 3 more joints, to keep our intoxication going.  I kept my attention span until he played 'You Don't Know How It Feels' (my favorite Petty song), then I just drifted away.  I don't remember the setlist, but I know I had a fun time.  I've prior warnings and knowledge about wormwood, and how it can make the mind hallucinate/trip.  I was waiting for it before the show began, but it didn't happen.  I guess the trip comes in the final stage of intoxication, just before the body sobers up, because at some point in the concert, I noticed that colors were becoming more vibrant, Petty's background was becoming more intense and seemed to pop out and move towards me.  The moon was glowing like a blacklight over everybody.  Everybody around me seemed to have a neon-bluish-purplish glow.  I looked at the ground and the grass was now all shamrocks, bright green shamrocks.  All I was able to hear was flange from the guitars and I was able to see the soundwave frequencies rise and fall.I didn't expect any of this since I figured that it wasn't going to happen, so I panicked a little.  I had to calm myself down because I realized that the trip was turning into a bad trip because I couldn't get myself out of that shock being suprised creates.  A high-pitched ringing overpowered all sounds and inflicted my ears because everything seemed so loud, and then a low drone came just as loudly underneath the ringing.  Everything that moved had trails behind them, and everybody in my group were as green as the shamrocks that we stood on.  The sky was still purple, but the vibrant energy coming from the guitars, keyboards, background, etc. were cascading into the sky by vanishing as it came closer to the blacklight moon.  The whole world became one big strobe light, the trip became a violent...it had peaked.  For some reason, there was a big shamrock strobing above the stage.  I've done acid numerous times before and I have robo-tripped once before, but none of those were hard as this before.  I had to sit down and close my eyes for a moment.  I must've blacked out because it all ended.As soon as it began, it was over...and I was sober.  I was still in a curled up sitting position, and I look up at my sister (who was part of the group I was with).  She told me that I was sitting down for quite a while, and that I had to take out my lighter and hold it up because Tom Petty just finished and the encore is coming up, in which I did.  The last song he played was 'American Girl'.  It was a great concert.All in all, the trip was pleasurable.  I'd like to try wormwood and alcohol in the incorporated state of Absinthe.  I can only assume that the trip became so violent because there was more alcohol and marijuana than my body was able to handle (I was smashed for most of the afternoon).  I'd like to do it again.  And for those who are afraid to trip, there is really nothing to worry about.  Once it begins, don't try and stop it, just let it happen, go with the flow, and you'll be ok. This experience lasted about a month long. I acquired the pills (a lot of them) from a friend who had found them. I wasn’t sure what they were so I looked them up and it didn’t sound too bad so I figured what the hell? I took two. Felt great! Took some more. Felt better! Woke up the next morning and didn’t remember a thing. I did the same thing for about a month every night. Then I started to mix alcohol with them. By the time I was doing that I’m pretty sure I was addicted.One night I took about six. I’m not all that sure what the dosage of them was. They looked exactly like the ones in the pictures in this vault. Anyway I took about six and polished off about half a bottle of tequila. I played guitar for a while then BAM! That’s all I remember. I woke up the next morning and there was a knife next to my bed and my arms and body were bloody as hell and cut to shit. I apparently tried to kill my self that night. I swear I can’t remember a thing.Apparently I called my ex-girl friend to tell her I loved her and the next day when I told her about the experience she said I called her at three in the morning crying and carrying on about this and that and I freaked the shit out of her. I don’t remember doing that. I flushed the remainder of the pills down the toilet that day and went though what I considered mild withdrawals that night at work. I was sweaty, irritable, nauseous, and such. Kind of like if I am just about to get the flu or something. Lotus is an old friend, I have had many experiences with the flower of the Nile.  I started with joints mixed with weed or alone, then the tea, both were very relaxing and some visuals with higher doses. But every time I soak the lotus in wine for up to 2 days and consume, I get a stimulant effect.  I could drink a glass or 2 of the lotus wine and continue to drink the rest of the night without getting too drunk and little hangover.  I wanted to see how a larger dose felt so I soaked 10g lotus in 1/2 bottle resling wine (2 glasses), for five days.  On the night of the fifth day I drank the two glasses with some of the plant matter.  The mix was extreamly bitter compaired to the usual 2day soaking.  It had a dry aftertaste that the wine alone dosn't have.  The first effects were felt within ten minuets, the usual warm head (wine), and clearness of thought and a feeling of wanting to converse with everyone (lotus).  I am normaly introverted and like to sit quietly. Normaly it stops there and I have a great night.  But I kept going higher and feeling more energized.  It had only been a half hour since ingestion, and I was higher than I've ever been on lotus.  It felt like I had taken a rail of coke.  I had to walk around and couldn't stay in one place long.  I found myself pacing around my house and yard incredably jacked up.  My heart was pounding and my body felt like every cell was vibrating, strong CEVs and visuals 1 1/2 hours.  Then I droped down to a normal feeling of lotus and wine.  I can’t stress how uncomfortable I was and I will not let it soak so long ever again. Ever since I was about fourteen I have been known to drink a little more than I need to. It was no different this time. I am seventeen now and drink almost on a daily basis. But anyway, here is how it started. My sister was turning nineteen and she was having a huge party at the hilton hotel. I was told there would be lots of alcohol. Well this party seemed appetizing to me seeing that there would be an untold amount of alcohol present. So I went.Soon as I got to the party I started slamming down shot after shot of hennesy and hypnotic. I must have drank around ten shots when my brother in law saw that I was drinking up all of his hennesy and so he took it from me and pointed me in the direction of the beer. So the night went on and I was happy with my drunkeness at this point. We were playing quarters, and pong, and other various drinking games. At this point sipping the beer was no good, I felt as though I had to chug. So I did. Somewhere between my fifthtenth and twentieth beer I decided to confront my brother in law about how he hits my sister when they are at home. This started a fight, and he is much bigger than me. I got beat on for a little bit until my sister noticed us fighting and stopped it. So the night ended and everyone went home except a few of us.I woke up the next morning feeling fine, so I opened up another beer and started drinking. When I had woke up I noticed that I must have got so drunk the night before that I still couldnt see straight. We finally left to go to my sisters house, bringing the untouched alcohol with us. I continued for about a week of drinking beer all day long from the time I woke up until the time I passed out.Alot of things I cannot remember about that week. I remember nearly drowning in a hot tub and almost crashing my sisters car into a stop sign. That week was the best week I will never remember. Best thing about it, I didn't have the slightest bit of hang over, and I only threw up a few times. But for some reason I had a sharp pain in my side for about a month and the next two or three bowel movements I had were insanely painful. I am a very uncertain person, and yesturday it just showed through so much. I was depressed, and I have a bit of a problem distinguishing the truth on how I feel about someone/something, especially when it came to love.So I went over to my ex's house and drunk 1 and a half shots or so of 70 proof, and between 3 or 4 beers. I was pretty fucked up, I felt fantastic, it feels like DXM but without the dreamy feel of DXM, and not AS empatheogenic, but still empatheoginic. I was extremely minded at the time, and was hanging out with my ex, and just got a desire to tell her the truth, something I can not do when I’m sober. I felt that I made up my mind of how I felt about my ex, so I told her how I felt instead of what she wanted to hear, I was completely straightforward, honest, and blunt(though not rude). I find that I sugar coat things way too much when I’m sober, and when I’m drunk I see things as they really are and the curtains covering the truth are completely released. It's pretty amazing.Somehow I wake up the next day, and I feel so much more understanding and I feel like I can take closure from her. I don't feel as dependent for her, and I just feel more independent, and very optimistic and enlightened to think of another road. A day before this experience I was terrified to think of no Tiff and was extremely clung to her, when I got drunk I saw all the flaws the way they ARE, I was not in denial of them, and I saw just how irresponsible it would have been to go out with her, etc. I have  for quite a while had a problem with anxiety. Namely social anxiety. I have realized that the most logical cause of this is GABA deficiency. I have a history of using Xanax considering it is the only thing that wipes out the anxiety for me. Even alcohol has only had minimum effects.So being no longer able to find Xanax I searched for a more accessible substitute. I have found many reports praising Phenibut as being a great supplement for anxiety so I tried it. By it's self it does very little for me. I used as much as 2000 mg at a time with no noticeable results. I tried taking it with Theanine, the amino acid found in Tea, and it helped some but not enough.Then I mixed it with alcohol without even thinking about it because the Phenibut wasn't all that noticeable in the first place. I generally have a moderate tolerance for alcohol. It takes about 4 beers for me to get a buzz and 7 to get drunk. But after taking Phenibut and Theanine and drinking just one beer I felt a nice buzz like I had already had 3 beers. I drank 3 beers and I felt drunk. But not just drunk, relaxed, calm, talkative and euphoric, all feelings I don't normally get even with alcohol. And I still felt a relative amount of awareness and concentration unlike with just alcohol. It felt as good as a 2mg bar of Xanax. So in conclusion Phenibut by itself does very little (in my opinion) but mixed with alcohol it produces a feeling that I rarely get and a feeling comparable to my favorite drug, Xanax. A few years ago I decided to try brewing some Pilsenkraut using the recipe available at this site.The only ingredient I wasn't willing to pay for was the henbane plant matter its self, so I grew some from seeds I acquired from a now defunct ethnobotanical supplier. I managed to grow the plants rather successfully and come harvest day I reaped, separated the flowers and leaves and left the seed pods to open on their own. Unfortunately once the flower and leaf matter had dried, I was only left with around 30g of material, of which the recipe required 40g, so I decided to add a handful of seeds when the pods opened (I remember reading somewhere that some monks used to add a handful of henbane seeds to their regular beer batches for `extra effect`).After a week I syphoned off the brew into bottles with a spoonful of honey added to each, and left those for a further two weeks. The resultant pilsenkraut tasted much like traditional flat cider but with a touch of fizz. I was so excited at successfully producing my first batch of tasty pilsenkraut that most of it was given away to friends or taken down to the pub I worked in at the time for people to sample. It was when I was down to my last 2 or 3 litres that I decided to consume the rest on my own to try the pilsenkraut `experience`At the time I used to smoke a lot of weed (cannabis, in this case resin) and so was probably fair stoned before beginning the endevour. I didn't particularly have too many worries at the time and was fairly contented with life (well as much as a skint student with child can be). I drunk the remaining brew over the space of around 3 hours (I had one 1 litre bottle and three 750ml bottles each 3/4 filled with pilsenkraut) in my home with my then partner not taking part. I think I also had a few bowls of weed during the experience.After the first bottle (the litre one) I started to feel a little bit drunk, as though I had just drunk a litre of 5% beer. After the second bottle the regular drunk feeling started to abate and a sort of `drunk on shrooms` feeling begun to take over. After the remaining two bottles I no longer felt drunk like on alcohol but a sort of wired drunk, like that from mushrooms. Colours were a little more vivid and everything started to take on a surreal quality. Unfortunately this is where I ran out of the beer and although the surreality intensified a little more after half an hour or so after my last bottle, no other effects seemed to.The next day saw me with just a little groggy feeling but no other untoward side effects, although I do remember wishing that I hadn't had any weed so that I could have properly discerned the effects of the pilsenkraut more clearly.My circumstances changed soon after that experience and I wasn't able to brew any more of the loverly beer (I did have another batch on the go about a year later from the seeds I grew, but that spoiled1:<, and my circumstances changed yet again). Overall, I associated that experience as being similar to what I experienced (well from what I remember of it anyway) of when a friend and my self demolished a bottle of absinthe each, except the absinthe was a hell of a lot more intense (and a good 10 hours disappeared from our lives forever!).I have recently though purchased some henbane seeds and will soon be growing again with a view to brew! Last summer, I have been prescribed 1 mg hydromorphone because of my severe back pain. As you probably know, one milligram is the weakest dose therefore I often used more than recommanded.It was a normal friday night : me being alone at home. The events took place around 8 pm. I was about to take my 8 pm dose when I noticed a precaution note on the label : ''Never take with alcohol''. And of course, I wondered what it'd be like to do so. That's how stupid I am. Though I went on the web to have an idea of what I should be expecting. After reading tons of warnings about hydromorphone combined with alcohol, I finally decided to do it. I popped four milligrams and swallowed them with half a glass of vodka.I was all excited and happy with the thoughts of the high I was about to feel. But the joy didn't last too long : the more I was waiting for a rush, the more I felt down. Opiates usually give me a soothing feeling but it wasn't soothing at all. 35 minutes after the ingestion, I was so down that I wasn't even able to think or feel anything. Seriously, I felt tired at the point where I wasn't even able to end my cigarette. This was scary. I immediately went to bed, knowing that my mind could turn off by any moment. I probably got asleep instantly because I don't remember anything from that moment.I'm glad I only took 4 mg! In conclusion, not fun at all, and very dangerous because of respiratory depression. Please follow the notes on your script.  DOSE: \\xa0  oral Alcohol (liquid) \\xa0 1 tsp smoked Syrian Rue (ground / crushed)            BODY WEIGHT:   175 lb         I picked up some Paganum Harmala at the local international market and planned taking it with my next shroom experience. One night I came home moderately drunk and decided to smoke about a teaspoon of ground Harmala seeds with out follow the fasting regulations for MAO's. After about 5-10 minutes I started to spin and passed out. I woke up the next day with and extreme headache and I felt very nauseous.Now it has been nearly two months since the experience and I am still experiencing headaches. It probably doesn't help that I am extremely stressed out with school, but I am pretty sure this experience has cause me to have on and off headaches every day for almost two months. I am a little scared, but I can not conclude my diagnosis until the school year is over, and my stress levels subside. I was considering taking a mild dose of LSD. I have read all about the magic it has worked with migraine sufferers. Experience starts now: Setting: After school, at my father's house, in the basement, alone on a friday afternoon, bored out of my mind. I had just scored some dope earlier that morning (just Valium and Cannibus) and had planned to 'relax' after my classes were over. My mindset was positive going into the experience because I had just finished my first week of college and felt proud of myself, though my body was quite exhausted.Step one: Ingestion of two 5mg Diazepam pills (lowest strength)Step two: Consumption of 5.5 ounces of fine MerlotStep three: Sit and wait for effects, delay the cannibusT + 0:30: To the already full effect of the alcohol, comes the first wave of effects of the Valium. The first thing I notice is a slight distortion in my visual focus, but only when I turn my head to look to either side, not when I'm just looking ahead. My anxiety about the onset has diminished and I'm feeling confident and looking forward to the experience.T + 1:00: The Diazepam has nearly doubled in strength, and has comfortably mixed with the effects of the alcohol. My muscles feel extremely 'warm' from the inside out. As if there is physical energy moving in and out of every pore on my body. Every time I move my back, my spine sends tingly sensations throughout the rest of my body. There is absolutely no nausea. On the other hand my mind feels extremely clear, almost too clear. It seems as though I can only focus on one thing at a time (no multi-tasking) and when I do so I do it very well. Every care and worry of mine seems to be forgotten.T + 1:30: I have just finished smoking two relatively large sized bowls of some Canadian beaster (I was hoping for that funk, but none was available). Overall, I can say that smoking cannibus after injesting 10mgs of Valium and drinking a large glass of wine is not a wise idea. My vision is absolutely horrible. It is about equivalent to drinking a pint or more of hard liquor, while my body feels more like a DXM high (very numbing, intensly slurred speech, and very poor motor skills), there is a very slight nausea but not in vomitose form. I am able to function and walk around but I feel very uncomfortable and disoriented. At this point, I cannot write anymore. It is hard to focus on the computer screen. But overall I can say that this combination is intense but not completely terrible. I haven't felt too sick to this point, just very very 'out of it' if you may call it. I do wish to repeat this experience again at some point. I am now a senior in high school and thought I was done with my sophmore/junior drunk self who would reach up girls shirts and touch their backs when I was really drunk. This had not happened in a very very long time so when I began drinking this night I was not worried.It began with a 12 pack of some brew that I had and was giving my friend j some until the keg arrived for the party he was throwing. When j's keg got there I played a few games of beer pong. Thinking I was pacing myself good at the time. Where I messed up was when I began to chug every beer that the other team made which made me in a pure state of inebriation. One of the things I hate most in life had occured again, I was reaching up girls shirts yet once again. My memory is hazy but I remember the girl saying STOP TOUCHING ME and I simply replied with a 'I'm not' even though I obviously was. Well moral of the story is alcohol is very powerful and can make you act a damn fool. As of now I am extremely embarrassed and am leaving you with these words to be careful and know your limits because I defianently did not last night. T=0:00 :- Started drinking alcohol: 7 - 12 standard drinks were consumed over the night.T=6:00 :- Ingested orally: 4mL of Clonazapam (2.5mg/mL)T=6:20 :- 5 standard drinks were consumed by this timeT=6:20 :- 200mg of Tramadol was ingested intra-nasally, by this point the Clonazapam had started to take effect. It felt similar to being effected by approximately an extra 5 standard drinks of alcohol.T=6:20-6:40 :- The Clonazapam was now having a significant effect and seemed to really increase the effects of the alcohol. I usually get quite drunk from 15 standard drinks.  On this occasion I felt the same but felt no obvious nausea. This is abnormal for me. I also started feeling very drowsy.T=6:40 := 1/2 of a relatively high strength ecstasy tablet was ingested orally, a 'white turtle' that was around in the autumn of 2006 in Melbourne, Victoria for those playing at home. I laid back on the couch and from this point I remember nothing and when I say nothing I mean exactly that. To me, as soon as my head hit that couch, I woke up at approximately T = 14:00 in another room. The following recount is complied from the recollections, photos and video taken on the night by my close friends: T=6:40 := I was disorientated, incoherent, uncoordinated, obnoxious, rude and arrogant. My friends likened the latter three symptoms to the type of person I become on cocaine. I was stumbling around and obsessively adamant on going out for a walk to buy cigarettes. A friend of mine affectingly called my state 'fishbowling'*, where my memory was no longer than 3 seconds long.  *Definition of 'Fishbowling' (verb): Metaphorical term comparing an individual suffering extreme short term memory loss (<10 seconds) to that of a goldfish with short a short memory hitting the side of a fishbowl :). I was keen to take some magic mushrooms that were available on this particular night.  Importantly to me, this is one drug that I adamantly refuse to consume and have NO intention of ever taking. Luckily I have very good friends and the offer was just in jest. This again proved how my steadfast inhibitions were EASILY lifted. Later I was stunned to learn of this fact, and how far from myself I had actually traveled. T=7:20 := Orally ingested the second 1/2 of the ecstasy tablet. I now entered a state of intermittent consciousness. I would converse normally for a 2-3 minutes, which was immediately followed by a 10-15 second catatonic episode.  Following this, I would resume the preceding conversation I had so elegantly left. I should also mention that I do not remember any of the last 40 minutes so I cannot tell you if I felt any of the ecstasy and Tramadol which is the CRUX of this report: to highlight the strength of Clonazapam and its overpowering effects over the other drugs consumed. I should also mention. I continued in this state for another 60-80 minutes after which I fell into a deep sleep from which I could not be woken. My friends carried me on the couch that I passed out on into another room so I could just sleep it off at which point I vomited (no memory of this occurrence). By far my most proudest hour. T=14:00 := I awoke and had absolutely no recollection of what happened between T=6:40-8:40. This was a completely surreal feeling, especially considering the fact that after seeing the videos/photos from that time period, my memories were not revived, even to this day two months later. To me those 2 hours didn't happen. The person I saw in the photos and videos was not me, it was my body, but it wasn't my conscious mind controlling it. This may be a difficult concept for someone to understand who hasn't experienced it. When I did wake I was still mildly confused and disorientated, but I had regained conscious control of my mind (thank god!!). When I finally got home a couple hours later I slept for 17 hours.  The point of this report is to highlight the frightening power of the drug Clonazapam. Bart's final thought after listening to taped sessions: 'Does my voice really sound like that?'  First off, I'm very experienced with many psychoavtives, including cannabis, LSA, diazepam, oxazempam, amphetamines, cocaine, nitrous, DXM, alprazolam, codeine, hydrocodone, nicotine, sertreline, dextroamphetamine, zolpidem tartrate, oxycodone, salvia, etc. I awoke one Saturday morning and decided that my house work would be more enjoyable if intoxication came into the picture. Within rapid succession of each other I consumed three 450mg Valerian capsules, smoked a huge bowl in my water pipe, swallowed only 35mg DXM, 3mg melatonin, and 5 beers, all on a totally empty stomach, as I dosed before breakfast. I couldn't have much DXM because the only syrup I had also contained guafenisin. T=+1.00:00- Put on some ambient tunes and lounged on the couch. I have begun to get heavy audio hallucinations. I hear a marble rolling down a track, a bird singing right behind my ear. When I close my eyes my body seems to swim forward at incredibly high speeds. My linear memory is smashed to pieces as all of the other substances amplify and are amplified by the cannabis. An intense feeling of peace and tranquility has now taken over me, and I'm off to listen to more music.T+1.20:02- I just had something to type, and then I promptly forgot what it was. The high is still coming up, so I imagine the peak will be intense.T=+2.25:03- My high has peaked. I have now achieved tacticle and visual hallucinations. For example, a red car keeps appearing in my driveway. As I double take back to get a better look, the car is gone. [The squemish be warned] Unfortuanately I have had one major problem. Drinking and taking valerian capsules on a completely empty stomach apparently isn't good for you, as I just deficated what I could swear was urine. But coming out of the wrong place. Hopefully I'll be okay on my come down.Conclusion: Wow, I was pretty incoherent during my writing, so I must apologize. Overall, the experience was very long (6 to 6 and a half hours), and had the same characteristics as drinking and smoking weed together, only more amplified and relaxed, with more frequent and realistic hallucinations. I would recommend this combination to any responsible person who is well experienced with psychoactives. Also note that there is a slight hangover the next day. Nothing a tylenol and a shower can't fix, however :) When I was 17 me and my friends started drinking regularly. I don’t mean just drinking, we got smashed everynight of the week. This lasted for about a month until most of my friends started getting tired of it everynight so they cut back to once or twice a week, but that wasn’t the case for me and my friend Joe.We both loved drinking and when we didn’t, we'd sit there and just keep saying back-and-forth, 'why didn’t we drink tonite'. Just made the night horrible, bUt this was a rare occasion since we loved it so much and couldn’t get enough. We'd binge (like drink from wake to sleep) for like 3-4 days, then stick to only at nights for a week, then binge again. This wasn’t a problem during summer since parents are at work and we didn’t have to get up early, but then school started and we couldn’t stop.First 3 days of school we didn't drink, but it was so unnerving to not be drunk at night that I couldnt even sleep without sneaking downstairs for a rum and coke, or atleast a few shots. If I didn't have a drink I'd either not sleep at all or wake up every ten minutes in a cold sweat.I imagine it was the same for him cause he called me after the third day back to school and said something like, 'hows about we go pick up a 12 pack for old times sake?' (old times sake, like it had been years since our last drink) I picked him up and it turned into two 12packs. The next day we realized it wasnt that bad going to school hungover so we did the same thing the next night, and the next night, etc.It started getting real bad though when I’d drive him to school (he went to a different school) and we'd kill a 12 on the way. That's when the parents started taking notice. I got grounded for a month for getting caught drunk in school. Didn’t really make a difference, instead of going to drink with Joe, I’d sit at home and watch tv and drink myself. When I got out, it started right back up.My dad kicked me out two days after my 18th birthday. I lived with Joe for about 7 weeks, then he turned 18 and his dad kicked us out. Living on our own we didn’t even go home at night, we'd just drink and drink and drink, until we passed out. Then the cops would find us sleeping on someone's lawn or in the park and we'd sit in jail for the night. We were arrested for underage drinking/drunk in public four times in the same month, not to mention a number of other times.I'm only 18 and I've been attending court ordered AA meetings everyday for the past month and a half and take all sorts of meds to help with the cravings. (same for joe) My parents are letting us live at their house now that we're in the program, Joe's dad said he'd kill him if he ever came around so he won’t even ask to return home. We still have a drink every now an then, but only like one or two drinks, haven’t gotten smashed since the meetings started. It's been 2 weeks since my last drink and i'm pretty proud. I haven't lasted that long in a while. Still can’t find a job though because of all the drinking arrests and because my schedule is limited due to the meetings, they won’t say that’s the reason but I know it is. I am a drug addict/alcoholic. I have used just about everything, and I smoke marijuana, drink, and pop pills on a daily basis. I'm a doctor shopper, and a thief. I get multipal prescriptions for drugs like Klonopin, Restoril, Soma, Lortab, Adderall, and Oxycontin from many different doctors and dealers. My whole life is centered around finding and using. At age 22 my health is poor. I have had three near fatal overdoses. I'm physically addicted to many of the drugs I take and get very sick without them. I use anti-depressants, multi-vitamins, and many suppliments to slow down the amount of damage to my body, and to keep me from going over the edge. It is not a good existance at all. It started out as great fun, but has grown into a problem that makes me a liar, a thief, and a low-life.I dropped out of school, I can't hold a job, my family no longer trusts me, I'm on probation for writing fake prescriptions, and I'm responsible for introducing dangerous drugs to good friends who then became addicts themselves. I never planned to end up this way, but I was too foolish and high to see it coming and now I'm trapped. I fight constantly with the part of me that wants to get help. I keep using out of fear and desparation. I've been high so long that the idea of sober living terrifies me. I'll get spun out on Meth or Adderall, then use downers or opiates to come down, and I don't feel comfortable around people unless I'm high or drunk. Anxiety, paranoia, depression, confusion, and loneliness are everyday feelings for me. I was able to get my GED, and I've held a job for a month now, but it is all on the edge of falling apart again because I can't pass a drug test for my probation officer. Not everyone who uses drugs ends up like me. Many people can handle their addictions and function well in society, but some people just can't and end up in a living hell. Today I smoked a joint when I got up to get rid of my hangover, took 6mg of Klonopin and 120mg of Adderall, and now I'm off to buy some Vodka because it is my day off (but I would have done all this even if I did have to work today), and then I will do just about the same thing tomorrow. I'm a slave to chemicals!  [Erowid Note: The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] Mindset And Setting: I wasn’t really saddened by the fact of leaving all my friends and life behind me due to the fact it hadn’t become a reality to me that the next day id never see them again (which has affected me a lot).  Overall I was excited and pleased to be going out the night before I left and planned on getting pretty wasted. We made plans to meet outside the club at about 8pm.Preparations: My first mistake was not having much food, being from Zimbabwe I really never ate much so the only meal I had that day was 3 slices of pizza at about 1pm. I made my way down to the store (I was only 14 but this was no issue in Zimbabwe) and I purchased a 700ml bottle of vodka and no cola to dilute it as my friends planned on bringing that.Experience:I arrived at about 7:50 and waited for my friends which I had planned on meeting so I sat down at our usual drinking place and waited.T= 8:00: Another mate of mine who I never planned on meeting came and sat down with me. I opened my bottle and he had his own as I put the bottle to my mouth and drank my first sip that warm cozy liquor sensation briefly overwhelmed my body. We began talking about stories and drinking from our bottles not taking notice of how much we were having.T=8:30: My other mates arrived with there booze and came and sat down and the person who I was splitting 50% of the bottle came and sat next to me. I looked down at the bottle noticing I had already finished half of the bottle straight so I made a quick excuse and give him some money to go buy a half jack. We all began talking again about 15 of us just telling stories and drinking before we went up into the club.T=8:40: The effects of about 3/4’s of the bottle began to hit me just seeing trails of the lights as I swayed my head side to side looking at the street light and was very talkative. I felt altogether I hadn’t stood up since I sat down so I never really felt the affects that much.T=9:00: I had finished my whole bottle and decided to go upstairs to the club and say wats up to everyone. As soon as I stood up it hit me real fast, it all went to my head and I staggered into the club. As soon as I got to the top of the stairs another one of my friends called me down and helped me back to the drinking spot.T=9:10: Feeling pretty wasted after a full bottle of straight vodka I didn’t really care if I had any more so I took my friends bottle and had some of his which I couldn’t even taste the usual burn it leaves on the throat. I heard someone spark up some good greens and in my state I didn’t really care as the realization began to hit me that I wasn’t going to be here tomorrow. I had 1 hit of weed and remember attempting to walk towards the night club after that I had no recollection of what happened:Friends story of what happened: When I was walking I began to run and apparently ran full speed into a street light and passed out, I began throwing up bile as I had nothing to eat and about 30 of my friends were all helping me, getting me water and keeping my head up so I didn’t choke on my vomit.T=10.00: My brother managed to walk past and wonder what all the commotion was about, I was very secretive about my drug experiences to him so he was pretty shocked when he saw me passed out vomiting. He called my parents and they took me to ER.The Next Day I wake up and in front of my eyes is 2 long poles so immediately I thought AHHHHHH FUCK I'm in jail. I then turned my head a bit and realized I was in a hospital bed. I looked down at my arms and I had 2 drips coming out of them and my parents were sitting down on the chair. My blood pressure was so low they wouldn’t let me leave the hospital and if I was in the state I had been for 30 min more I would have been dead.State I am in 3 years later: After looking at other peoples stories and noticing people saying how there perception of life is so messed up I came to the realization of why I have been so fucked up the last 3 years. I use to be able to study for hours but now I look at words and after 3 min I'm just starring at the paper and then 5 min later I realize I'm not reading anything. My vision ain't what it use to be fuzzyish I guess u could say and I have lost all sense of emotion I wouldn’t care if I died tomorrow. I don’t like being very social like I use to be and overall id say I'm pretty fucked up. Don’t take this as a bad thing I love drugs now, had good experiences with alcohol, weed and recently DXM but I just thought id share my story for anyone who relates to this. The report I am writing is explaining about my first time ever drinking a real amount of alcohol (all other times were simple sips).  I was in the middle of high school when this experience happened, so I am probably quite a 'lightweight' to most of you guys.  I have never touched tobacco or cannabis.The last time I tried to drink alcohol, all of my friends got really drunk, and I was busy dealing with them.  By the end of the night, I never got a chance to drink.  I sure learned a lot that night though, mainly that you need to be careful about how much alcohol someone around you consumes (two of my friends probably got alcohol poisoning that night).  So for my first time, I was careful to make sure the enviroment around me was safe and easy to interact with.  I knew that I was going to use the computer and my Xbox, so I made sure both were up and running before I would consume any alcohol.  My mom was going to bed early due to work she had the next day, and so I designed my preparations around not waking her up mainly.  At the time of writing this, I can be pretty proud about the preparations I took, and it led to no complications.  Planning ahead definitely has its benefits.I had my 'plan' all thought out days before, and it was only a couple of hours before I would start drinking.  All I needed to do was wait for my mom to go to bed, and I would be off drinking.  However, I had one problem with a cold that I had for quite a long time.  I started coughing a lot, so decided I needed to take some sort of cough medicine.  I had Dayquil and Nyquil, and at the time it was 9:30 pm.  I knew I'd be up till around 3 am, but for some reason I thought that Dayquil would keep me up all night.  I knew that Nyquil is a powerful drug, and it will combine with the alcohol to do some negative effects, but I chose to take it anyway.  It was in my stomach for around one and a half hours before I started to drink, and I was starting to get really tired.  This effect eventually went away.  I think Nyquil might have had a big effect on my body that night, but I am no expert, so I don't know for sure.Right before my mom went to bed, I actually had a lengthy conversation with my mom about alcohol, and I eventually realized I didn't need to be so secretive about it.  I still decided to stick with the plan of her not knowing, but now I know if I get caught it won't be as big of a deal.  My mom went to bed, I waited about 20 minutes, and then the 'show' began.The first thing I decided to drink was all of the whiskey I had on me, and I mixed it into orange juice.  I honestly think I didn't have enough to even get a 'buzz,' so I chugged the whole orange juice/whiskey combo while holding my nose.  It was 11:00 pm when I did this.  I played one game of Halo 2 online that lasted around 10 minutes, and then I went down stairs to chat on my computer.  It was after about 2 minutes of chatting that the effects really hit me, I mean, I never expected the effects to hit me so fast like that.  I drank this strong old red wine that my mom had, and then I went back upstairs.I was totally new to alcohol, so the effects surprised me.  The world around me wasn't a blur at all like I thought it would be, but I felt really dizzy.  The only way I could compare it to is when you are one of those spinning rides in a theme park, and you can feel the G-forces weighing down on your body.  The only difference was that I could move my body much more, and the feeling didn't make me feel bad at all.  I had fun just moving my head side to side, because it just felt cool moving my head.  I also noticed that walking felt really weird, I kept stumbling and had to keep holding onto walls in order to walk.  Tastes in my mouth also felt really numb, and I fear that most people that are drunk can start drinking a lot of hard alcohol without feeling the taste.I knew I needed to try out the 'social' aspects of drinking, so I started talking to my friends on Xbox Live while playing Halo 2.  I am usually pretty timid, but I noticed that I kept talking almost nonstop.  I knew it was also the typical slurred speech you get from drunks, and I kept trying to make my speech intelligent, but I always failed.  Alcohol basically screwed up my speech, but I could still think fairly good.  I could see that my inhibitions were lowered, and it didn't really bother me at all.At around 2 am, I knew I was coming down.  One of the odd things about alcohol is that the effects come in waves, in which I feel the effects greatly, and then it goes down to an almost sober feeling, and then back up again.  I was in a continued state of feeling the lower 'sober' feeling, so I knew that I was coming down.  It was at this point that I recognized the true danger of alcohol.  I felt very tempted to go and drink more in order to get the higher 'feeling' that I had, but I knew I shouldn't.  The next day, I felt like getting drunk again, and that really scared me.  I had no hangover though.  I can see why this is a drug that requires A LOT of respect, because it is so easy to abuse. Let me start off by explaining my backround. I am a 17 year old senior in high school and an average kid. I drink about every 3 months, smoke weed about 3 times a week, and occasionally shroom. I have never had an adverse reaction to any of these drugs, though I seem to have a weak stomache when it comes to liquor (throwing up and whatnot).It was New Years night and me and a few friends were waiting for a delivery of shrooms at 'M's' house. We were waiting for about an hour when the news came in that obtaining our mushies would be highly unlikely, and almost immediately after I got a call from another friend that there was a huge party only a few blocks away. I said my goodbye to my shrooming pals and drove those 2 blocks to the party. When I got inside it was pretty empty but I was surprised to see 3 of my good pals just hangin out. I was contemplating getting drunk for about an hour when people just started showing up. Eventually there were about 40 people in the house, and that's when I grabbed a bottle of vodka and just started chugging it down.I was really low quality and tasted like rubbing alcohol, but I didn't care cause I really wanted to get smashed. After about half an hour I was feeling really good, perfectly drunk and no nausea or discomfort. I was chatting like crazy and laughing with everyone and overall having an absolute blast. My friend 'J' then came up to me and asked if I wanted to smoke a bowl, and, of course, I said yes. We walked out to his car and packed a bowl of some pretty high quality chronic. After smoking we walked back into the party and thats when things went wrong. I have smoked and drank before without any reactions, I would usually just have a good time and wake up with a hangover.When we got back into the party I started to feel really REALLY messed up, about as intoxicated as I have ever felt. The room was shaking, I couldnt hold my balance, and everything was sooo loud. I kept saying, 'I'm so fucked up, Im so fucked up' but it sounded like 'Ilm shlo fa-uked ap, Iam shoooo faaaacked oop' I was sitting on a couch just feeling horrible when I felt it in my stomache. I ran to the bathroom and puked into the toilet about twice, then headed downstairs to lay in the guest bed. My friend 'E' gave me some water and kept asking if I was okay, I told her I was fine and just wanted to rest, so she left me alone.I woke up about 2 hours later and the party was completely dead, everyone was asleep. Then I felt it in my stomache again so I ran to the bathroom and threw up about 3 times. I went back downstairs and then ran back upstairs and threw up some more. The room was still shaking and my legs felt weak, I also couldn't think straight. I would throw up every 5 min and nothing was coming out, just dry heaves. My mouth got dry from dehydration and I couldnt drink water because I would just throw it up. The vomit was sticking to the inside of my dry mouth and it tasted acidic. I spent the last 4 hours of the night resting next to the toilet and just puking my brains out. I woke up around 9 in the bathroom. I got up and talked to my friends telling them how sick I was, my fingers were blue and my face looked pale. I knew I had to get home and by a miracle I managed to drive across town to my house. I pulled over the car once and threw up on the street. [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] At home I told my mom I caught the stomache flu and went to lay down. She got me a hot water bottle for my stomache and I continued to throw up every 5 min for about an hour. The next day I felt okay, just weak and tired. I stayed in bed until I felt better, ate some food and gradually recovered. It lasted for about 2 days. I started using drugs at age 14.  I started with pot, then a few months later tried alcohol.  I was inexperienced and got caught getting WAY too drunk twice by my parents and they sent me to rehab.  After rehab I stayed sober for a year and a half, but I wanted to smoke pot again really badly.  So I was looking for ways to get high and still pass a piss test.  Rehab had not made me not want to do drugs, but, rather, had piqued my interest in all drugs.  While sober I learned about every drug I could.  Eventually I decided that I did not care about passing drug tests anymore and decided to start smoking pot again.  Shortly after trying it, I tried acid for the first time, and acid made me want to try EVERY drug.  I made a conscious decision to use every different drug I could.  I succeeded in trying every mainstream drug with the exception of PCP.  Anyway, my parents stopped drug testing me after I started smoking pot again and I began my journey of drug experience.  I used everything over the next four years.  From pot and mushrooms, to crack, meth and heroin.  I had a brief addiction to crack, and near the end of my drug days I was getting into heroin.Anyway, when I was 19 I got my own apartment with a friend of mine and our drug use skyrocketed.  I had a high tolerance for most everything and the question every night was not, what are we gonna do, but what are we gonna DO?  So on passover (a jewish holiday which my family celebrates, as we are jewish) my family was having a passover seder, which is a big ceremonial feast.  I do not remember this night.  According to my drug dealer I had purchased four zanbars from her earlier in the evening, and as the paramedics found nothing but a bit of pot on my person after the accident, I assume I took all four.  This is WAAAAAAAY too much zanax.  It's the equivalent of 16 regular zanax pills, which could not only put a horse to sleep, but kill a person of my size.  I was already fucked up and at the seder, according to my sister, I drank 6 glasses of wine, and I only needed 2 to get drunk, as I was on anti-depressants at the time (lexapro).  This was 6 glasses of wine on top of all the zanax.  Everybody at the meal had the suspicion I was fucked up but I wasn't stumbling drunk so nobody suspected that I couldn't drive.Unfortunately, they were wrong.  On the way home I must have passed out at the wheel.  I hit a cement wall at 65mph.  The seatbelt was the only thing that saved my life.  I hit my head on the roof of my car and cracked open my skull and killed part of my brain.  I was in a coma for 3 days and spent 2 months in the hospital, followed by a month and a half of brain rehabilitation and followed again by a month of drug rehabilitation (a GOOD drug rehab, and not a crappy one like the first time).I am sober going on 9 months now.  I have a fabulous girlfriend I am crazy about, a fantastic relationship with my parents, and I'm going to school and making A's.  I have permanent cognitive effects from the brain injury, but I can still live a normal life of achievement.  What happened that night was divine intervention.  God was trying to show me that I was fuckin up big time and He showed me in the only way I would listen to.  I don't expect to change the way anybody who reads this feels about drugs, but only to allow my story to be heard and pondered for those curious. It was a friday night, and it was a particular tame one, with no parties goin on.  We were pretty bored and had heard stories about dxm and had always wanted to try it.  So we took a trip to Kmart and went to see if they had the pill form of straight DXM (Cs) without guafenisine and the other crap or whatever, it needed to be straight dex.  We ended up finding cough syrup and these cough drop type deals that were the only ones that had only dxm in it.  The cough drops seemed like the best idea because we could just swallow em and we didn't have anything to measure cough syrup with.  Not knowing how much to take, we thought that 12 10mg cough drops a piece would work.  Later, we headed to the beach and took 12 of the 10mg drops a piece.  After sitting around for an hour and a half we realized that nothing was probably going to happen.  We called some friends and they luckily had beer!  Good thing because I was feeling kinda shitty after takin the dex, all tired and kinda stoned, not feeling up to bein around a lot of people just yet.  So I drank 1 beer, and to my amazement, I was drunk off my ass!  Four beers later and I was as drunk as id ever been without passing out or something.  This was truly amazing to me and I felt I had to tell everyone.The fact that you can get really drunk off dxm and one beer, and still be able to pass a breathalizer test made me very excited about our discovery.  After drinking only five beers that night, I woke up in the morning and the room was still spinning, Wow. I had chronic insomnia for years and nothing was working, infact it was ruining my life because I had to drop out of school and had to find a job that didn't require a set schedual.  Well I started stripping to pay the bills because I can stay up all night and I am reasonably attractive and even used to model.  I started taking Elavil at 50mg then 100mg and finally at 150mg. I was able to sleep everyday and wake up feeling great.  Well because of this drug I gained 25lbs and lost my job, but I had begun Real Estate so I didn't care and I was back in school.  The highest dose began to stop working, gave me mood swings, constipation, a weaker eye perscription and began to make me be constantly depressed, not to mention turned my skin and nails yellow.  I started drinking with my pill because if I could still sleep every night I could deal with the side effects.  Alcohol did work for a short time, but eventually I needed more and more to go to sleep.  The thing with Elavil though was I got a different type of drunk when I mixed this pill with booze.This drunk consisted of irrational and unhealthy behavior which I had never had.  This new kind of drunk gave me a feeling of euphoria and invincibility and because of this I got arrested.  My designated driver was more drunk than I was and normally I would have called a cab, but instead I wanted to have fun.  I got in my car to drive my friend home and thought screw the speed limit, I can drive fine, which I could.  Well I got pulled doing 60 in a 35 and didn't care or even worry.  When the cop came up to my car he asked how much I had to drink and I said too much.  I passed all of the field tests with flying colors but the cop still wanted to breathalize me and I blew a .19.  He was shocked because my physical reactions were perfect, but my attitude was so happy and care free that the cop felt bad for arresting me.I was never put into handcuffs, the cop took a 30 min walk with me to try to sober me up and we even began to talk about our personal lives and I got him to give me very private information of his life because I was so laid back.  He never put me in jail because I was so nice and he even drove me home after the arrest to ensure that I would be safe.  Well I'm charged with a .17 and a speeding ticket but I'm waiting for my court date.  The cop will testify in my behalf, but I still have to get a breathalizer on my car for a year, go to counciling, pay a fine, lose my license, do community service and hopefully not be givin any jail time (possible for me up to 3 years).I cheeted on my boyfriend but don't remember a single thing the whole night, I tried to jog around my city at 1:30 in the morning in a bad neighborhood because I could and even lost $900 at work stripping because I drank champange and let the man walk out with out paying me because I didn't know what was going on.  For some people the pill may work under a doctors supervision and with out alcohol. Thursday night I picked up an 8ter of some bubblegums. I immediately went home and started smoking at about 10:30 PM. I smoked my first bowl (about 0.5 g.) and crushed up 1 Xanax (0.5 mg.) and swallowed it. I felt really adventurous at first so I decided to raid my parents alcohol cabinet. I poured myself a drink with about 4 shots in it and drank it. It went down very easily. In about 15 minutes the full effects of everything started kicking in, it was about 11.I went to my room to lie down and started getting extremely scared that I was going to die from drinking and taking xanax it was intensified by the paranoia that I usually get while smoking. I decided to smoke some more. I packed two more bowls. I really started feeling the weed, I just collapsed on my bed and turned music on my ipod but I couldn't stay comfortable because whenever I put on the headphones I thought someone was at my door. I took off the headphones and sat in my bed very dizzy but with a heavy feeling of euphoria. I stared at one spot on the wall above me for about 15 minutes. During that time I thought about a wide variety of things. I asked myself questions about myself and came up with answers that sounded to me then like I was very wise but looking back on it the answers made absolutely no sense. I fell asleep soon after. The time was about 11:45. I locked my door and in the morning apparently it took me an hour to wake up but all and all it was a good experience and I would do it again but with a lighter amount of alcohol. Me and a friend (I'll call him Flute from here) were hanging around in our little town in Sweden and doing nothing. The sun was shining and the summer were getting closer, and the urge of just sitting in a park and drink beer under the sun were getting stronger and stronger. It had been a long cold winter and I couldn't wait for the warm inviting summer.After we had been to 'systembolaget' (the place were they sell alcohol in sweden) we met some older friends. I didn't know them well back then and still I was a little sceptical of being around them at that time of the day. They were those kind of people that doesn't have the best reputation often called alcoholics.Well, after all we went home to one of them and drank a few beers. Both me and Flute knowed that one of them were a strong abuser of Iktorivil, Diazepam and Flunitrazepam. So we asked if he had some that he could sell. After awhile we get about ten pills. I started with one to see what would happen. I didn't know much about benzodiazepines at that time, still I had read some about them, and I really thought they would be something for me.At first I felt a bit disorientated, some kind of anguish were crawling under my skin almost as I feel when I have smoked alot of pot. But I guess this was just because of the fact that I was sitting with two alcoholics in the middle of the week and eating pills. I guess I couldn't take that.(T+30 min)About half an hour later when I was in the bathroom I found myself very relaxed. I took one more pill and chewed it carefully. The taste was incredible discusting. But after a few glups of beer it was gone.(T+90 min)At this time I felt very comfortable, the only side-effect so far was the strong lazyness in my limbs and muscles. But at this time I wanted to go out from his apartment, and so we did. (T+170 min)At this time I had swallowed one more pill, Now I was really messed up. Just to walk felt like a life-task if you know what I mean. I felt like a marionette on my own without the ropes. I fell everywere. Still this felt quite funny. There was nothing in the world that could have scared me at that moment. I was the strongest man alive. I didn't really cared about anything. Nothing felt important, still everything felt funny in some kind of way. The total freedom from anguish and fear was the highlight of the whole experience. And I'm a very neurotic, paranoid person normaly.(T+190-220 min ??)Me and Flute were taking of from our older friends and headed for a party with our regular friends. At this time we had bought a bottle of Vodka that we had finished. Everything was really fucked up. Well, at this moment my relation with time ended and there are alot of gaps in my memory, but I'll do the best I can to get a picture of what happened next. Well, we came to the party, now I know that it was a bad idea to go there. Well, that's not the case anyway. When I got in people were looking at me and laughing. Some in a 'What the hell is he doing' way and some in a 'Oh my God, he's totaly wasted' way. And they were so right. But at that time I couldn't understand it, I couldn't understand anything eccept that I wanted more beer and that I wanted to sit down and smoke a cigarette. I don't know but I think I swallowed one more pill at this time. I sat down in a couch and relaxed. I guess I relaxed a little to much. I tried to place the beer on the table but missed it with about one meter. Everything were sooo sloow in my head. I could hear people talking about me and with me, but I couldn't care about them. I just wanted to smoke my cigarette. When I stub out the cigarette I missed the ashtray and did it on a walkman instead. People were screaming to me that I was doing something wrong. And yes, they were right. So instead I did it right on the table.After that I started to dream with my eyes open, not those kind of dreams that are full of emotions and happenings. Just thoughtless, empty dreams. I couldn't tell reality from dream, and to be honest I didn't cared. My conclusion is that Iktorivil is a very strong and truly sedating benzo.After this experience I have tried some other Benzodiazepies like Diazepam, Flunitrazepam and Xanax. But my favorite is still Iktorivil. It's really the kind of stuff that helps me get away from the anguish. Still I think it's a cheap shortcut that can mess up things for you if you do it to often. And now I don't use it at all. Not more than an ordinary psychonaut would do LSD. [Erowid Note: Unconfirmed Death Report.

I thought so too until 2 days ago.To start off with a little bit of background, me and my buddy Doug have been recreationally using different substances together for about four years.  Our relationship was very special in the aspect that we had both smoked weed together for our first times, and we all had the same group of friends, a mix of jocks and skaters and stoners (unusual, huh?)  We have done coke, mushrooms, acid, painkillers, and of course, smoked weed together on several occasions.  We were best friends, and our parents are also very good friends with each other.  They approved of and trusted our experimentation under the other's watchful eyes.  They instructed us to be safe, but basically let us be 17 year old boys.  We were always hanging out together, and not always just to get loaded.  We were very close friends.Two nights ago, Doug, me, and another of our friends Ben were hanging out in Doug's barn drinking some beers, and just chillin.  We had smoked some bud, and had each drank about 6 shots each and drank a few beers each.  We were less fucked up than we have been together many a time.  A guy that we mutually know named David came over, and had a few grams of coke for sale.  We bought a gram for 40 bucks, and put it away for later.We played some video games, and smoked a few bowls.  We were just hanging out and everything was going good.  We both noticed we weren't as drunk as a few hours before, so we decided to do some of the coke.  We had figured it would be a waste of coke to do it while totally sloshed.  So we each divided up two 1 inch lines each and snorted them quickly... it was mediocre coke, not good but not shitty.  We just chilled, playing around with Ben's guitar, and listening to old nirvana albums, and just bulshitting, enjoying our highs.About 30 minutes later, Doug said he was coming down off of the coke a little, and was getting a little tired from all the shit we had done, and decided to go pass out on the couch.  Keep in mind he has done coke on several occasions, and in no way shape of form felt any different than any other time, or he would have said so.  I know him well enough to know he would have told us if he thought something was wrong.  He just was simply tired, and fucked up, and wanted to sleep it off like so many other times he has done the same thing.  We all smoked a cigarette, turned off the lights in the loft, and went into our own little worlds in the dark.  Approxomately an hour later, I was still awake and in a chemical daze on a sleeping mat on the floor, and I heard puking outside.  No surprise.  Happens every time we get together and drink, someone throws up.  Then I hear crying... not as normal as puking.  I stumble to the barn door and see Doug laying on the ground, and can see him shaking with sobs, and still puking in between.  I wake up Ben, and we both help him into the barn, almost both completely sober by now you can imagine.  We get him back on the couch, and give him some water and a hot dog bun, thinking that it may be alcohol poisoning and wanting to get any more alcohol in his stomach absorbed to give his liver a break for a few minutes.  He thanks us, he is completely responsive, and says he is just really drunk.  He has done this before, and we think nothing more of it.  He passes out, and he starts snoring very loudly.  After about 10 minutes of watchin over him, Ben and I pass out again.  We are very relieved.In the morning at about ten o clock, Ben and I wake up and see Doug still sleeping.  We get up and feed the animals, and collect a few eggs for breakfast.  I live in a very small farming community in Idaho in case you were wondering why we do weird shit like this.  We go about our normal morning shit for about two hours, and still Doug is sleeping.  His mom asks us to wake him up as he has to help Doug Sr. make a hay delivery in an hour, and he needs to get ready.  We go in and I grab his shoulder and shake him.  He is still sleeping.  I shake him four or five times, and then notice he isn't even moving which is very unusual.  I grab his hand, and it is very cold.  I don't know if you have ever grabbed a dead person, but it is the FREAKIEST thing anyone could ever do, especially not expecting it.  The medical examiner came over, and said Doug was indeed dead, but said he hadn't the slightest clue why, as he was so young and healthy and hadn't been injured recently.  But me and Ben knew why.  It wasn't the cocaine alone, or the alcohol alone.  Doug had done both before, separately, and was experienced with both.  We by no know means took a larger than average (for us) dose, and I didn't even have a coke-over like I usually do on the morning after snorting.  The man at the hospital later said that what had killed my best friend was not either drug individually, but a chemical produced by the combination called cocaethylene (I am not sure of the spelling).As of right now, me, Ben, Doug's parents and sisters, and everyone else who was close to him, is in shock.  Two days ago we were being kids.  We didn't even think we were going overboard.  It was very normal for us on a Saturday night.  Everything was normal.  I for one am in a daze, and still haven't fully realized yet that Doug is gone.  Ben and I are both the same.  We joked today and didn't really discuss it much, although we are both very much shocked and in disbelief, I think.  I am just now starting to realize what happened two nights ago.  I just wonder why not me or Ben.  We all drank and snorted approximately the same amount each, and we are all the same size.  Nothing was abnormal until Sunday morning.I am so shocked, that I don't really believe this is real.  I just hop I can warn others about this dangerous mixture before someone else loses their life over an a night of fun.  I do not mean to preach or anything.  In fact, I will continue to smoke marijuana, but I think it will be a long time before I use cocaine or alcohol again, and forever before I use them together again.  It is pointless for a 17 year old boy who was a good friend, a good brother, and a father to be to lose his life for a night of drugging. 8:20pm - I took in between 17-20 Grams of Nutmeg. I've read about possible methods of ingestion and found that the way I did it went fairly well. I measured out the correct amount, about 1 gram per 10 pounds, and added half each to one pint of choclate milk. I stirred it well and ingested it. Many people have talked of nutmeg being hard to eat, but this way there was little too no taste and no sawdust feeling in the throat.8:27 - I'm writing this as I go so as that I won't miss any of my thoughts or feelings so this can be recapped without any biases. As of now I am experiencing mild nausia and what can be called nutmeg burps.  I shall sit down and watch a movie, as most reports say the onset of nutmeg takes 2 - 3 hours. I will try to be patient.8:37 - I'm starting to feel a little light headed, but this most likely is a placebo effect.8:40 - I'm feeling now sort of like when I begin to climb the marijauna peak. As of now it seems to me that nutmeg is great.8:52 - My slight buzz seems to have diminshed and now has been replaced by a general numbness, even though my mind seems to be clear. I've also realized that time seems to be travelling extremely fast. It seems as if only 10 or 20 minutes have passed. Also many things that should not be funny are.8:57 - I walked to the bathroom and noticed that my movements are very jerky. I am going to get a glass of whiskey now in hopes that it will enhance my experience. The movie idea has gone down the drain, so now I am just going to watch some tv.9:14 - I've just had half of a cigarette and about one ounce of wiskey and it feels like I've had 3-5 drinks already. All the people who say that this does bring you down are correct!!!!! I am having troubles collecting my thoughts. This is a really good substitution to alcohol. It is very cheap. As of now I am glad that I have tried this and most likely will try it again.9:49 - All my sensations seem to have stopped, my existence seems almost pointless. All I am left with is my mind and my conciensenece. I am going to listen to music to see if I can induce a state of euphoria.10:53 - During my music session I had a fairly good time when I lost most control over my body, I could not move a muscle. So far it feels similar to being drunk, but still coherent. I am totally in control of all aspects of myself with no adverse effects to speak of. I am wondering though if a second wave will come. Many people have said that nutmeg works in waves so I am hoping it gets better from here.12:49 - I'm sad to say but I see no second peak forthcoming. Here is the end of my nutmeg experience. I am glad that I have put to rest my aprehension towards it and finally have come to realize that it is in human nature to consume as many stimulants as possible.I don't know if I would do nutmeg again, but I see no harm in it. In my opinion it is not as bad a ride as most other people make it out to be. It takes a long time to start and it has minimal effect but the most I can liken it to is getting really drunk without the hangover afterwards, or the whiskey farts in the morning. All of this testimony was written in real time. All of the times listed are certain. This testimon was only eddited afterwards for spelling and gramatic errors. I recently ordered some Piracetam from an internet bulk supplier. I bought 700 grams for just over $20. What attracted me to this substance was how it supposedly helped reverse brain aging, increase cognition, and help counteract brain damage. Now I've done some drugs in my day. I used to do just about everything and I think DXM and ecstasy had the most negative impact on my brain. Not to say I had brain damage, I just think that my past drug use had some negative effects yet I was still able to properly perform my job as an aircraft structural maintainer for USAF cargo planes (the military's full of former drugees) and scored a 91 on my ASVAB while I was still smoking pot.I noticed some positive effects as soon as I started taking it. The key is to keep a regular 3x daily regiment, 750mg each. Alcohol's effects are greatly increased when taking Piracetam. I used to be a semi-heavy drinker drinking 10+ drinks on an average drinking night. However when I started taking Sneaky Pete (as I call it), after around seven Coronas I ended up vomiting and was as hungover as I've ever been from drinking. My continued alcohol use decreased gradually but I didn't take P the days I drank. Now I have little to no desire to drink and am taking P 3x daily everyday now and it works a few times better for me. I'm also very glad that it helped me stop drinking regularly.Overall I would recommend Piracetam to the whole world because it is extremely well tolerated by our bodies and it seems to only do good to me. Also I can't wait to go back home and try mixing it with various stimulants/psychadelics as it apparently skyrockets their effects. Have a great day! I started out with two Xanax pills on a Saturday evening.  I'm not a fan of Xanax, and I usually turn it down when offered, but a friend had given me two of them, and I was starting to get bored, so I broke each pill into 4 pieces and swallowed them.  The effects don't come on too hard for me (with Xanax); I gradually feel slightly drowsy and lose track of events (more so with larger doses).  About 45 minutes or so after injesting the Xanax, my friend and I went out for the evening.  Since Xanax blurs my memory the day after taking it, I can't provide much detail of the night.  We met up with two friends and decided to get an eight-ball of cocaine.  We then went to another friend's apartment, and he's pretty cool so we let him do a couple of lines.  He gave me another Xanax pill and I took it right away.  I was pretty fucked up by now and I was having a lot of fun.  My three friends and I went back to our place to get coked out.  We did some amazing lines, some about 5-6 inches long.  I was experiencing a much different high than usual.  I felt the Xanax still, but inevitably the cocaine had taken over.  If I had known we were getting coke that night, I would have saved the Xanax for later.  We all had a good time.  We talked, listened to music, and I think we smoked a primo blunt of marijuana, laced with a generous amount of cocaine.  We had done all, or almost all of the cocaine, and we knew the cocaine come down was something to avoid if at all possible.  So we called our main weed man, and he said if we wanted anything we had to be there in no less than 20 minutes.  Being as high on cocaine as we were, we cleaned the place, wiping powder off the glass kitchen table and whatnot, probably in no more than three minutes.  We hauled ass over to our dealer's place. We had to considering how far away he is and how little time we had.  We bought about an eighth of some high quality dro.We were relieved, to say the least, that we had the weed to beat the cocaine come down.  When we got home, we lit up and drank some liquor one of my friends had brought.  We were all plain fucked up by now; me especially since I had taken the three Xanax pills before all of it.  Funny, though, I kept wanting more alcohol.  The liquor of all things wasn't seeming to be kicking in very strong as it usually does.  I drank a LOT of it.  It later turned out my friend's older brother had taken half the liquor in the bottle and watered the rest down, which made sense.Well, after this crazy night, we all went to a breakfast diner near downtown Dallas to eat.  All I remember from it was eating strawberry pancakes.  I pushed it that night.  A lot could could have gone wrong, but nothing did.  But I did it right.  I mixed the substances, which made it all the more interesting.  My only regret is that I remember so little about that night as a result of the Xanax.  But hell, it was fun.  My friends told me I seemed to be having the most fun out of all of them.  I don't doubt it. This experience took place a couple years back.  I was using my friends bathroom when i looked in the medicine cabinet and discovered a bottle of Darvocet.  I'de heard of it before, but had never actually taken it.  I decided to pocket 4 medium sized red pills.  About 2 days later, a few friends and myself decided to have a few beers at my place.  But before drinking, I popped all 4 Darv's (not the brightest idea).  We sat in my basement playing cards and just talking.  The darvocet made me feel intoxicated fairly quick.  After just three beers i was quite buzzed.  After finishing my 6th bottle, i was quite drunk.  I also had a very warm, numb feeling throughout my body.  A friend suggested we go out to the garage and smoke a couple bowls.  We packed some fairly potent cannabis into my waterpipe.  After just 4 Hits, i felt extremely stoned.  I was forced to sit down and lean against the wall.  My vision became very obscured, all i could see was a really bright light.  This sensation lasted for a couple minutes, and afterwords i still felt very intoxicated.  I managed to drag myself into the house and collapsed onto the couch.  Just laying on my back listening to Led Zeppelin was extremely pleasurable.  I awoke the next day feeling drained, and my vision was still off a little bit.  But besides that, no real 'hangover effects'.  Haven't used Darvocet since that day, but am considering using it again without the alcohol. I used to love GHB.  I used to say 'it's not dangerous, just don't be an idiot about it'.  Last night I proved myself to be one of those idiots - I figured my body's GHB tolerance was high enough to withstand the onslaught I put it through last night [0.8 Gs cocaine cumalitive 6 caps G oral roughly 5 alcoholic drinks]. I was spending the evening with my 2 friends 'N' and 'C', both experienced G and coke users.  The night started off at N’s place.  N supposedly found a year-old bag of coke in his winter jacket, so we all did a few bumps, and decided to get some more after the bag was done.  Everyone took a cap of G to fight off the jonesing feeling before N went out and got a half ball (so we could have about .6g each).  He arrived shortly after, and we headed out to the bar.   I was feeling like a sketchbag, so I took my second cap of G about 20 minutes from arriving at the first destination.  This helped to take some of the sketchyness away from the coke buzz.    We had another drink each and then continued on to the next destination.  (Note:  I know it is dangerous to drink on GHB.   However I decided to have a few drinks anyways, and didn’t feel the warning effects because of the cocaine.)  Here I consumed around 3 vodka limewater glasses, and still didn’t feel drowsy.  Eventually, the night died down at around 12:30 (this is a Monday night) and we called the night quits.  N and C carried on to their respective homes and I walked a short 3 minutes to my home.    This is where it gets bad.  I was still buzzing off coke so I didn’t feel at all drowsy enough to sleep.  I had to be up for 7:00 for class the next day, and the time was now after 1am.  I took 3 caps of G one after the other, along with two 15mg prescription antidepressants (Remeron).  I remember falling asleep that night.  The only thing I remember after that was waking up in the hospital to a nurse saying “I’m just going to insert this catheter into your penis”.  I was disoriented, confused and a bit angry.  I asked her how the hell I got there, she told me I arrived in an ambulance.    I started to think about how my roommates (5 of them) could have deemed it necessary to call an ambulance to take me to the hospital at 4 in the morning.  After all, for all I knew, I was in deep sleep and ready to bounce out of bed for class at 7 o’clock.     Anyways, I dozed off after the nurses finished doing some blood work at about 5am.  I woke up, still in the hospital at 8:30 for breakfast.  They released me after breakfast after a stern lecture from my nurse, who has a son my age.  At this point I was dreading coming back home to my roommates.  They are inexperienced with GHB and probably thought I was dead, when I was actually just in a deep sleep.Boy was I wrong.  Apparently, Monday night at around 4:30, when I thought I was asleep, I was literally running around the bottom floor of the house, banging into walls and furniture repeatedly.  I woke all my roommates up, who were scared to death.  They tried to subdue me but I kept flailing my arms violently with all my might.  They even said I grabbed a knife at one point.  It turns out, they called the cops to subdue me and an ambulance to bring me to the hospital.  They all spent the whole night at the hospital there with me, worried sick that I had suffered permanent mental damage.  When I heard this I nearly puked.  It turns out that my dangerous mixing didn’t just put me in a deep coma, but caused a short period of psychosis.  I was apparently doing all this in my sleep.  Right now, I’m in my room at 4pm.  I haven’t left my room because I’m ashamed.  I’ve only talked to one roommate, who gave me the real story. The rest I owe a huge apology.  That night marked the last night I ever touch GHB, and hopefully cocaine.  If any readers see any similarities between their usage patterns and those described in this story, please, realize that it is going too far.  Don’t end up like I did.  You may lose the respect of your best friends, and you may have to have a catheter pulled out of your wang. I'm prompted to write this message due to my own experience of one week ago.Now, given that my daily intake of alcohol is higher than average, thus my tolerance quite good, I could never have prepared myself for what happened on re-entry to Thailand (my home for the past five years).Though I would normally sleep well on long distance flights, last week I returned from the UK and chose to catch up on all the latest movies/tv shows on board. Downing several small bottles of wine over the 2 6.5hr journeys, I was no more than a little 'happy'. That is, until around 30mins before arrival at Bangkok. I remember checking the eta on the overhead tv screen and then....................NOTHING! The next I know, I'm waking up in my condo, 6 hrs after arrival, 1hr from the airport.I simply have no recollection of the 6hrs between. This has disturbed me considerably, so uncharacteristic of my behaviour and will haunt me for a while to come.I received a call on my mobile the next day from an English chap I've never met before. He claims all sorts of worrying behaviour. Apparently I was falling all over the place, I'd abused many Thai officials, had cursed anybody who approached me or my bags and, probably the biggest mistake of all, I'd emptied all my bags in the taxi rank at the airport. Emptying all my valuables and several thousands of pounds (sterling) from my bags, in full view of all the taxi drivers. I've lived here long enough to know that you simply don't do that in SE Asia. Too many people are living hand-to-mouth, it is not uncommon for Nationals to conspire together for instant financial relief.This may only be of concern to me but I would like to know if others have heard of anything similar before. @ 35yrs old I've been drunk a thousand times before but this? I never felt in the slightest bit drunk, then instantly lost 6hrs of my day. Surely this has something to do with the cabin pressure as there were no warning signs for me, just an instant shut down???????This may not be the grittiest of stories but I do think others need to be aware of this case, so that they don't rely upon the luck that I had. I could have awoken in a cell, a gutter or a hospital and in desperate need to return to UK for having lost everything. In fact, I was lucky! But would hate to put that to the test again. To anyone who reads this, please moderate your alcohol intake in the air.My paranoia is now subsiding a little. My ability to sleep at night is improving and I'm drinking very conservatively now. I had been a fairly regular drinker up until my experience with alcohol poisoning. I drank every weekend, and sometimes drank till I puked, but i had never really gone overboard with alcohol. I, like most kids my age, didn't really realize how dangerous alcohol can be in high doses, and had never really considered that too much alcohol can kill you. Woops! Ignorance didn't help me in the end.   The experience began fairly regularly, me and my friend, H, were bored one saturday afternoon, so we decided to take 6 shots each of Vodka. I have a pretty low tolerance, so that is about as much as i could have drinken before getting queasy. Me and H were having a great time and decided to head down to the beach.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]  We drove down to the beach (i would never recommend drinking and driving, you know it kills) and we lounged around for a few hours, just talking and laughing, usual drunkeness. Soon it was hours later, the sun had already set, and my buzz was begining to wear off. H then called up some of her other friends and invited them down to come join us. They arrived around 7pm with a cooler full of various bottles of hards, beers and wines. They all sat with H and began talking with her, but it was awkward for me since I didn't know any of them very well, so i just sat by myself, lonely, swigging a bottle of tequila. Well, swigging is probably the wrong word, i some how ended up chugging most of the 1 liter bottle. I calculate that I took around 18 shots worth of tequila within 5 minutes. I had no idea how much i had drinken, all i knew was that i wasn't feeling the buzz of the tequila yet and it was 15 minutes later. So I chugged three beers. This gave me a grand total of around 21 drinks in my system, all drinken within a 20 minute timespan, with a further 6 drinks that i had drinken approximately 3 hours before. A few minutes after the few beers i started to feel really, REALLY drunk. All the tequila, which had so sneakily lied in wait, was beggining to hit me. I stumbled over to a friend, C, and told her i was starting to feel sick...cut to the next morning. I wake up, on a roll-a-way bed in my house, with my mom on a roll-a-way next to me. The time jump between me at the beach to me in my house was like the blink of an eye. I looked over at a clock and the time was 5:30 am. I looked down at my shirt and noticed that it was covered in puke and blood. I started to panic, 'What the fuck happened?!''Did I drive home?!''Why am I here?!' I have never blacked out until this, and i could not remember a single detail of the night after the aforementioned. I was suddenly taken over by an urge to vomit. I walked out of my house, not totally convinced my mom knew what i did, and started puking. My mouth was bloody, i am guessing from coming in too much contact with my stomach acid. My mom then came up beside me and said, 'that was the worst night of my life.' It took accounts from my friends who were there and my parents to piece together what happened. After my memory cut off, with me telling my friend C i was feeling sick, i walked over to a lawn chair by myself. My friends went over a little later to find me passed out, puking all over myself. They picked me up and took me up to my car, which was a pretty good distance away. They said the whole time I was just mumbling 'please no, it hurts so bad.' They loaded me in their car while my friend took my car. They were to afraid to tell me parents what had happened when they got to my house, so they just put me on a roll-a-way bed and left me (bastards). Luckily my mom awoke (mothers instinct i guess) and found me. She stayed with me the whole night. She said i was unconcious, shivering, drenched in a cold sweat, and vomiting in my sleep. I could have easily died had i not been under supervised care the whole night.Cut back to the morning after. That morning i was running to the bathroom to puke every 10 minutes, which decreased in intervals until later on that night when I stopped puking. I lost 8lbs, i felt weak and sick for days after, and was scared out of drinking for a long time after. I began drinking again a few months later, and continue to, but i have not gotten sick once from alcohol since then. It took me a night of hell to learn how to drink, lets hope it isn't the same for you. You want to have crazy visual hallucinations? Stronger and more realistic than LSD or Shrooms or 2-CB?  Well I have the drug for you. Alcohol.Over the last year I progressed from a social drinker to a full blown alcoholic.  I am not lying when I state that I could drink an entire 750ml bottle of vodka every single evening and not feel drunk in the slightest.  For the last 3 or 4 months I just drank to keep the shakes and panic attacks away - I had no desire to get drunk, I just drank to stay sane.Well, on New Year's day I decided enough was enough, and I quit cold turkey.Bad idea.I had managed to get 20 valium in order to help ease the withdrawlas and prevent delirium tremens in case things got ugly.  Probably saved my life, really.The first day with no alcohol I was a jittery paranoid mess - my heartrate was around 120bpm constantly, even when taking valium. I was sweating and freezing at the same time, and dizzy constantly. I had to call in sick for work because I literally could not stop shaking.The second day is where the fun began.  I'm being facetious.All day long I kept seeing things out of the corner of my eye, almost like the shadow people seen after a 3-day meth binge.  And then I started hearing things.  And by 'things' I dont mean an occasional noise or sound that doesnt exist- I mean I started hearing voices everywhere.  My guitar would whisper at me whenever I walked by it, and the wallpaper would tell me that it planned to kill me.  In perfect english, and perfectly audible.  Just as real as if someone was standing behind the wall shouting at me.At this point I downed 4 valium in an attempt to knock myself out and avoid the madness.As I turned off the lights and laid down in bed, the visuals began. I still don't know how to describe what I saw- the visuals were brightly colored and constantly swirling and spinning.. I saw flourescent outlined people walking around behind my eyelids, waves crashing against beaches, animals running around, friends and family walking towards me.  I had an overpowering sense that my life was flashing before my eyes and I was minutes away from death.  These visuals were more 'real' than anything I had ever seen, and I've tried almost every hallucinogen known to man.  They were in a totally different category of strangeness.  It absolutely scared the living daylights out of me.  I quickly took 3 more valium and laid there shaking and crying, praying that I would soon pass out.About an hour later, I finally blacked out.The next day I was fine, except for a little residual case of the shakes.I will never drink alcohol again, period.  I clearly can't control my consumption and don't want to take the chance that I could end up in this sort of situation ever again.No other drug has ever caused me so much grief in my entire life.  I have tried basically every drug there is, except heroin, and had absolutely no problem with addiction.  But alcohol is a different story altogether. From the time I was 18 years old, the summer before college (1996) changed my life forever. I started drinking with my friends at music concerts, on vacation, on the weekends, and then that turned into going out all the time and drinking to deal with money problems, family problems, school problems, etc. I didn't realize it at the time because I thought I was having a good time, but looking back I would have been more focused about school if I'd have cleared my head and thought about the consequences of my actions. Nobody was killed from alcohol poisoning, no DUI's, nothing like that, but there were so many times that I did drive around after I'd gone out for a night of binge drinking. Needless to say, I am extremely LUCKY and will never do that stuff again. I never needed to go out and get drunk, I didn't feel better while I was doing it, but it was just something that people my age did, one after the other all night long. It seemed fun at the time, but as I got older, people were finishing school and getting on with their lives, and I was still hanging out and doing nothing, looking forward to another semester of taking the last semester's classes over because I got bad grades. So, when the money was out, I started working full time, money was rolling in, and I couldn't go out drinking anymore or I'd screw up my only source of income. Then I realized that was it, I couldn't drink until the weekend, and I could afford school and was conscious of my work. After one year of working full time, I got back into school full time, got all A's and only drink a few drinks once in a rare while. The only thing is that sometimes I look back and wish I would have realized how nice it is to enjoy life without drinking. Too bad I feel like an ass every time I go to my old college for football games and feel like I wonder who remembers me from way back when. I know for sure that I acted like a retard quite often because I was out getting wasted. Now things are different, and I actually did well enough to get into graduate school, but this time, school will be alot different. Maybe those things won't come back to haunt me. Thankfully I never got arrested or anything! I've tried numerous drugs.  I've ingested so many pharms it might make your head spin.  Smoked too much weed and definately inhaled way to much blow.  But last night was my first night with alcohol.It was 1 AM and me and my friend Jo popped the bottle of port we'd been sitting on for god knows how long.  it was a 50 year old tawny and at first we had intended on just sipping the fine wine...turns out after dessert and the second glass we just passed it back and forth like a couple of lose and satiated winos.About fifteen minutes passed and I realized how alcoholism is a valid addiction.  The extreme euphoria followed by muscle relaxation and then that wave of, 'Hey I want to be a social person.'  Passed over me.  At this point I called my girlfriend and began to talk.  Jo and I kept drinking during the conversation.The aire of the conversation was nothing but joy.  I was aloof and  relaxed the entire time.  Jo pitched in his two cents every now and then which made it interesting.  We talked for about and hour and then hung up.  Through the whole conversation Jo and I passed the bottle back and forth.The euphoria continued until about 4 AM.  During this time we slap boxed, played risk, and talked about things that neither of us would have spoken about had it not been for the influence of alcohol.Last night Jo and I bonded, we got closer than I had ever expected, and I know he feels the same way.  We've always been close, but now its different.  We're confiding in one another and we're close...its become brotherly.In conclusion:  Until last night I had tried everything but alcohol.  I mean everything, tryptamines, opiates, benzos, pot, shrooms, crystal, you name it I've got it under my belt.  But now I'm sticking to alcohol its cheaper and legal.Good luck to all of you in your drug experiments I hope you find the one that suites you best, I know I have. Last spring I ordered a 10ml vial of essential oil of wormwood from a reputable internet entheogen supplier. As an amateur psychonaut my reasons for selecting this particular drug were most likely romanticized accounts of absinthe intoxication in literature and film. Though I've had my fun with the substance, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone without patience, discipline and a good knowledge of preparation and dosage. I have none of these things of course.My first experiment was to make some 'absinthe'. Basically I bought a bottle of Pernod and added about 15 drops of the oil to it. I'd read an account of someone else doing the same, though this person recommended about 10 drops per 750ml bottle. Of course, the liquor and the oil don't mix, so I have to give it a shake before pouring myself some. Through this method, I get drunk long before I notice the effects of the wormwood. Being, as I said, undisciplined and impatient, I upped my dosage, adding more drops to the bottle and sometimes a drop or two right in the glass. When I did begin to feel the wormwood, it was like a lucid drunk, I was very clear headed but had the distinct feeling something was off. At some point during the evening I packed a bowl with marijuana, salvia divinorum 20x extract, resin of leonotis leonurus, and yes a drop or two of wormwood oil. In my hotboxed pickup truck, I got right stupefied and eventually went to bed.The next morning I felt fine, no hangover, no lingering effects as far as I could tell. Then in the afternoon I started walking the two miles to work. About halfway there, things started to get funny, I never saw anything distinctly hallucinatory, but something wasn't quite right. This lasted my entire evening shift, I'd catch things out of the corner of my eye, and generally mistrusted my senses. The pattern repeated for the next few days, whenever my activity level went up I started feeling funny. I came to the conclusion that the orally ingested thujone had deposited itself in my fat and was being burned whenever I became active. After three or four days of mild tripping, one starts to wonder if he hasn't given himself some brain damage. Hoping to purge the stuff from my system I began consuming copious amounts of caffeine. If my goal was to burn through the stuff faster, it certainly worked. I entered a state like the onset of a psylocibe mushroom trip. Walls moved when I wasn't looking at them, co-workers would turn around to see me standing on tables for no reason, and I generally went around doing and saying rather silly things. After almost a week of tripping, it finally wore off, but I retained a feeling of suspicion towards my senses for months afterwards.So I haven't tried taking large amounts orally since then, if it was in my system that long it stood a good chance of causing liver damage I'd imagine. I have occasionally dripped some on a bowl of grass, with varying effects. It seems that one needs to get it burning pretty hot in order to feel it. There was one instance in which there was some wormwoody resin left at the bottom of the bowl of my small plastic bong before my friend and I threw a large roach in there. His grass was a very sticky 'juicy fruit' and burned nice and hot with a big red cherry. As I was taking a large hit near the bottom of the bowl I tasted a distinct change in the flavour of the smoke which was immediately followed by a wave of sensation passing through my head. My friend and I were still on shift, and we ended up having to stay quite late to get everything done because well, we were tripping balls. Walls melted, everything was funny, and my friend spend an hour rearranging objects to look like faces and then taking pictures of them on his cell phone. It was crazy. I've never had the days-long effects when I've smoked it, only from oral consumption, but honestly I know too little about how the substance works to be doing the experiments do. Be careful out there, from what I understand, thujone is an incredibly powerful neurotoxin and a lethal dose is a pretty small one. LSD is safer, and easier to regulate doseages. Unless you're an advanced pyschonaut, or just crazy and stupid like me, it's probably best to stay away from it. The night began with an innocent beer. My female friend (we'll call her 'A') had an open house, with nobody due home for the next two days, especially parents. This was, of course, back in the days of high school, when my friends and I still had to hide it from our parents that we liked to party and get drunk/high just as much as they did. The only drinks in the house at the beginning of the night were some cans of Natural Light, so our group made quick work of those almost immediately as we waited for more beer. I had one, as well as A and my guy friends J, M, and D. After about an hour we all began to feel restless, so D and myself left in my car. We drove to a place 15 minutes away where we knew a guy who would sell to us. I believe I was 17 at the time.While at this sketchy drive-thru, we bought a case of Smirnoff Ice and two cases of Natural Ice, making do with our limited funds. When we returned to the party house there were many more people there than had been present when we left. All in all, about 30 people, few of whom had paid even a dime for the beer. The mad rush on the cases began almost instantly. Luckily, some of us were smart enough to stash our own personal supply away for safe keeping. Around that time I consumed a Smirnoff and three Nati's by means of chugging and drinking games. I started to feel just a little bit off balance and less stressed, but I weigh 200 pounds and was far from drunk.Now is a good time to mention that I had brought with me more than an eighth-ounce of pot and a small acrylic bong. I had purchased the bong that very day because the night before, at a much more tame party (although it DID end in the drunken host kicking everyone out of his house because he had been tricked into bonging a can of piss) my other one had been stolen. The smoking room was the basement, and between beers my friends, everyone else at the party and I made sure that a constant cloud of dank smoke filled the air. My eyes burned in their sockets they were so bloodshot. I would have been more than happy to call it a night at that point, but there was much more to come. Eventually our older friend R showed up. R had graduated long ago, worked in town still, and was known and liked by pretty much our whole school. Seeing this party going downhill (dry) broke his heart, so he took me, M and J to his apartment nearby to 'stock up'. On the way out, I grabbed and chugged my remaining beer.The ride to R's house was very surreal. We had the windows down although it was below freezing, and the lights by the side of the road blended together in a continuous flow. At his house, he introduced me to a large jug of Everclear, a 95% grain alcohol drink that is illegal in our home state. M tried to be macho and take the first shot, ending up gagging and gasping for breath over the sink. I knew my limits, so I first poured myself a glass of 'Blue Juice', a concoction of blue Koolaid and Everclear. Let me tell you, although this Blue Juice contained almost 25% alcohol, it tasted like straight Koolaid. Not a trace of alcohol taste. I quickly realized that without proper restraint, this drink could literally kill me.Feeling very content, I stumbled to a couch in R's living room and waited while J rolled up a fat peach blunt. It went around our circle of four about 10 times, and I was officially shitcanned. Coherent sentences didn't come easy, and I would have failed a roadside sobriety test badly. I was glad it was R driving back to the party, since he had not yet drank. We took with us a 2/3 full jug of Everclear, a 1/2 full jug of Triple Sec and a full pitcher of the blue juice.It came as a welcome surprise that most of the underclassmen at the party had left when we returned. More booze for us. The bottles went straight to the basement, and I packed another bowl. It is at about this point that my memory began to falter. I definitely recall pouring and downing another glass of Blue Juice, the mixing myself a cocktail of half Capri Sun and half Everclear, which I sipped slowly. A girl I've liked for years showed up at the party and I hit on her, failed, and went back to drinking. Intermingled with my sips of EC/Capri Sun were shots of Triple Sec and straight Everclear. By this point in the early morning I felt no pain, and hardly noticed the sting of almost-pure grain alcohol going down my throat.At one point, I approached a kid from the grade below me who I never really liked. I always thought he seemed cocky and vain, and at the time I was able to say anything I wanted without the slightest inhibition. I walked up to him and thanked him in a pathetic slur for stealing my bong the previous night. The kid was relatively sober, and shut me up with a snappy comeback. Later, I found that he hadn't stolen my bong, and in true drunk fashion, wandered up to him and apologized emotionally for my actions. In my own head, it seemed like I had all the answers, like I was the most rational person in the house. All this I was thinking while I could barely take a step without stumbling into a wall. While the bong made its rounds and I kept drinking, my friend D ran into the basment pleading for a condom. He had a chick drunk in one of the bedrooms but had somehow managed to fuck up the rubber he brought with him. R gave him one, and I remember staring into space for many minutes contemplating my jealousy that it wasn't me in his shoes. Later we discovered that D had no recollection of this incident, and the chick he had claimed to be up on swore she made out with D but no more. While I thought with disgust about my being a virgin, I stared straight at (more like through) a line of beer bottles on a coffee table. Suddenly, the arm of my friend M plummeted into the middle of the bottles, scattering them everywhere. He had fallen onto the floor, and wrecked the bottle display in the process. He then stood straight up, walked purposefully to the sink, and vomited in front of everybody. A cheer rose from the group. I laughed maniacally.Suddenly it dawned on me that I was extremely tired, so I walked to a couch in the center of the basement and stretched out. I fell asleep as soon as I was down, but woke up abruptly to the sound of breaking glass. J was standing in the doorway to the basement, laughing with a kid I didn't know and smashing the beer bottles one by one on the floor. J would throw one, then the other person would hand him another, and he'd throw it. I didn't really believe what I saw, but trying to stand up just resulted in a rush of extreme dizziness and me falling on the floor. I passed out again. An unknown number of hours later, I regained consciousness on the floor of the basement bathroom. I was already hunched over the toilet bowl, and a single Nati Light can bobbed on top of god knows how much vomit. For the next ten minutes, I learned the true volume of my stomach as out poured heave after heave of paint thinner-scented puke. I felt a hand on my shoulder and turned around to see J, who was guiding my head over the toilet. This was my last recollection of the night until I woke up mostly sober the next afternoon.When I woke up I was missing my pants. My boxers were perfectly dry, but my socks and shirt were soaking wet, leading me to believe I was urinated on in the night. Needless to say, A's house was all but destroyed. Among the pile of broken Smirnoff bottles in the corner of her basement, I found my new bong. The largest piece of it left was about as big as a quarter, not counting the stem and bowl, which were located far away from the rest of the shattered device. Also broken was a porcelain cookie jar, the lock on one of the bedroom doors, and every bar stool in her basement (4). How we managed to clean that house up enough in 48 hours to not be busted is beyond me, but we did it. We also learned many important lessons. As the now-infamous Blue Juice had gotten the best of all of us, we learned that Everclear was not a drink to be taken lightly. We also learned to bar people you don't know well from your home when heavy drinking is to take place. Today we still practice these rules, and have not had damage done to anyone's home like that since. I still consider that night the most intense drinking experience of my life. Where: Amsterdam, The Netherlands, EuropeWhen: 20th March 2004 (7PM-8AM)What: 5 grams of pressed cocaine in lumps (EUR 250) and lots of beer (I'm not on any medication or smoke)Who: 5 males, ages 21-30, mostly students, one is a good friend of mine (alles slecht?) and the rest are his friends whom I didn't knowWhy: A friend's birthday, curious and 'You only live once'.My personal drug history in a nutshell:Absinthe: some but no hallucinogenic effectsAlcohol: quite extensive field experienceCaffeine: just tea (and see Red Bull!)Cannabis: irregularly for the past 6 yearsEphedra: 7 times, double dosesGuarana: 20 times, one fat overdoseMushrooms (Hawaiian and Mexican): 7 timesNitrous: 2 timesRed-Bull Energy drink: had 14 in one night == strung out in the morning2-ct-7: 2 times, pretty light, happy tripAs you can see I've only had 'soft' stimulating drugs and wasn't really planning on trying E, speed or Coke. I think those drugs are relatively straightforward drugs and not in anyway intellectually challenging for the mind as hallucinogens can be. But this friend of mine was going to have his birthday and I heard from quite a lot of people I know they took coke. I also witnessed friends of mine taking it, I refused a couple of times.This time, I thought: what the heck, you only live once and how good can it be, cuz it's just simple and I like complex. My motivation wasn't (and still isn't) exactly clear to myself so I'll summarize it by saying I just felt like it. I dislike the possibility of me doing coke out of peer-pressure. So, there we were in the centre of Amsterdam, getting ready for an evening of beer and coke. Me and a friend were first-timers, the others probably did coke before (didn't ask). We were in this guys big room, couches, pc, big screen TV, lots of entertainment.22.00hThe first lump of coke was grounded and put on a handy mirror, a cut McDonalds straw was used as method of insuction :P The coke was passed around, I took the straw and didn't glimpse into the deep end but just dived/snorted right in. The lines that were cut were pretty thin and small, as far as I can say. Maybe .05 grams or something. We did lines throughout the night irregularly once every 20 minutes.Bitter taste, some numbness in the mouth, I read about that and it was there alright. But in spite of what I read, there was no sudden change in consciousness, no immediately elevated mood or energy. Maybe that’s my inexperience with coke but according to the other first experiences I read, the first time is highly noticeable. Maybe I didn't snort enough. After about 20 mins we all did another line and basically this pattern repeated itself irregularly through the night. The lines we made were kept of the same size.The physiological effects I felt were the following: increased body temperature, somewhat higher heartrate, some chills down my spine, bit of adrenalinesque feverish shudders sometimes. The more positive effects I felt were mostly indirect, I didn't get drunk although I drank beer in a reasonable rate from 7PM-7.30AM. I didn't get tired at all actually. When I got up to go for a piss I felt that my body was somewhat drunk and tired, but my mind wasn't and there's no democracy in my body! :DThe most positive effects I noticed was a slightly more analyzing perspective on stuff in general and a lot(!) of talking and less inhibition to talk. Especially considering I only knew one of these dudes before tonight. We had pretty cool conversations all through the night. That was actually the part of the evening I enjoyed most, just sharing our experiences and viewpoints, the time flew by during these talks. We played some mad tunes (mostly trance) and saw two movies muted, Resident Evil and Shrek, also some music-DVD's.When I'm sober I've got all these wonderful characteristics already (analyzing, talkative, outgoing), so maybe that's why I didn't notice a lot. The rhythm of the whole evening was pretty laidback, no energy-peaks or something but somewhat intense conversations. No hostile intensity, just...intensity.Conclusion:It was less than I expected from it. IMO: if this is a hard drug then mushrooms are mega hard drugs, way heavier for the mind. I was hoping for a big energy/ego boost and feelings of bliss and so on but in the end I just had a pretty cool night with some dudes, the coke kept me relatively sober and awake. I think I should've done bigger lines, cause I think I wasn't as high as coke can make someone. The effects I did experience were okay but not worth the money. But I seriously doubt if I will do coke again, as I have said exhaustively in this report, in my opinion psychedelics are way more interesting. This is a crazy story about a drinking night gone horribly wrong. Me and my friends, we are all 17 and 18, decided to have a party on Halloween 2003. We got our hands on 4 fifths of Bacardi O and lots of beer. I had also snuck in a 20 oz bottle of Vodka mixed with wine I had stolen from my house. Ok at around 9:30 I began drinking the disgusting drink I created (vodka + wine). I drank the entire bottle in 2-3 gulps. At this time I was inexperienced in the amount of alcohol I need to overdose on it. I didn't feel anything at first so I said ok lets brake open the Bacardi. I remember pouring some Bacardi in a small glass and drinking it, mixing it with a 7-11 slurpee, mixing it with beer and taking shots of it. I also remember drinking several beers. The last thing I remember clearly was me turning to my friend and saying 'Man this is the most fucked up I have ever been in my entire life.'The next thing I know I am waking up at 4:30 in the morning with my pants off. I am thinking to myself 'Oh fuck what happened?' I turned to my friend and said 'What the fuck man?' He just laughed at me. I stumbled my way into a car and got home, driven home by my still very drunk friend. Ok then I wake up in my bed feeling like absolute SHIT. I ran into the bathroom and puked. Then I started taking a shower and puked. I went back to bed and puked.My parents didn't see me puking but they knew what had happened. My dad comes up to me and says 'What the hell happened last night? You came home with your dick hanging out of your pants and wearing someone else's shoes.' Apparently I forgot to zip my fly and I just grabbed a random pair of shoes from the party, they were girl size 6, I am size 12. I talked to my friends about the previous night and they told me that I was so drunk I passed out immediately, but not before mumbling some stuff in Russian (my native language). When I was passed out some girls stole my pants and I woke up and began puking uncontrollably. I was told by several people that I had puked on at least 10 different occasions that night.I puked in a flower bed, outside, on some bed sheets, in the garage, on the drive way, and on some guy. When I was passed out my friend tried to move me to the garage because I was puking so much. While moving me he dropped me unto the floor and I had a bruise there the morning after. I was laying unconscious in the garage for hours just puking away. A girl gave me some blankets so I wont be cold but I just puked all over those. My friend gave me a bowl to puke in and I just smacked my face into it and passed out again. I also had some strange things in my pockets the morning after, my friends wet socks were stuffed inside my pockets, I also had a scratch on my cock (how the hell did that happen I don't know, but I sure want to know). The morning after hangover was so intense that when I went to drink a glass of water, as soon as I drank half a glass I started puking it out. My stomach was incredibly sore as was my throat. My brain could not function right the morning after, on many occasions I had forgotten that I even drank last night but then I puked some more and remembered. Some people said I am luck to have woken up from that. I was later informed that I drank 'more than I've ever seen anyone drink in my life man'. For the next couple months the thought of alcohol made me want to puke again. My throat was so sore from puking that swallowing my saliva was extremely painful. During my 3 day hangover I must have puked at least 10 times, had very bad diarrhea, and got grounded for 2 weeks. It was the worst time of my life. I am not much slower than I used to be, my grades dropped rapidly and I can't concentrate or pay attention nearly as well as I used to, I will never get back all those braincells I lost that night. I suggest to everyone NOT to drink with a ton of alcohol available and friends that are too drunk to care how much you drink. You should always have a limit, a given amount that you should never exceed. Or you will end up drinking yourself to death as I almost did. I was put on Wellbutrin 150mg XL late in 2003 after unsuccessful attempts to curb my lack of focus on school, health, and well being. I have had a history of 'depression' leading up to my removal in school and placement into Rocky Mountain Academy where I later graduated in August of 2002. Since the low dosage I was put on seemed to have no affects till about 4-6 weeks later (which is normal), I started focusing more, maintaining good grades, and cut back on eating out with my friends.This entire time it has been recommended not to smoke pot at all as it may not help the wellbutrin do its job. That was the first recommendation I blew off. I was binging on the weekends as I was getting better highs, although I can't relate this directly with Wellbutrin. Every night as I would go out, or in the mornings I would pop at least 5 pills of either extended or immediate release and head to school with no altered affects. Since looking for a cheap high was getting a lot more attention because of my lack of funds, I planned a weekend at a house unoccupied for a week. It wasn't going to be a big party, just another laid back weekend. A few people brought some bud and I brought some whiskey. I had popped a few pills earlier in the day and thought it might be fun to drink some to see what happens. After about an accumulation of 4 drinks I sat down for a while. I gathered my thoughts that were eluding to anxiety, fear, pain, and nausea. At first I figured it was the bud, for the three of us we smoked about 2.5-3 grams throughout the morning and afternoon. I knew it wasn't the bud a few minutes later. I got overwhelming feelings of involuntary functioning. It’s hard to explain but it felt like every nerve ending in my body, external and internal were being destroyed somehow. It wasn't a sensation of light needles, because my brain acted along with my body as well. I heard hundreds of popping noises in my head, it felt like the inner lobe was boiling over.My heart rate severely increased and I lost touch with how bad my condition was. I barely reached to notice I was having light seizures in a few muscle groups. My mouth would tense and open up and twitch, along with a few extremities. I suddenly got up and felt helpless at that point. My friends noticed and one particular friend had a similar experience with wellbutrin, said to just ride out the storm, I got pissed and realized I had taked about 450 mgs of time-released as well as the 150's SR. Somewhere around 4 I headed up to the upstairs bathroom. I had seen friends get sick before and never wanted to be seen that way, but for fucks sake I swallowed my pride and puked my brains out.I did that for about 1 and a half hours before I caught myself drifting off into a very euphoric state. My friend came up to check on me, I said I was sick but feeling better. Around 6 I got something to eat and tried to maintain. I would continue to be sick until the time-release wore off. When I could finally manage I got up to look at my face, as it felt weird, I was as white at a ghost with flaming chapped red lips. The rest of the night was incredible. I had thoughts and feelings that I had been re-born and awakened from something.It was hard to get rest but I eventually did have a very very light sleep, waking up to go back to high school. Some typical symptoms of a hangover were present but I have felt different since it happened only a day or so ago. Like everything in my world flipped. I was talkative, but I'm more shy now, I have a lot less anxiety about school-family, as before I stressed about everything, and I approach every situation differently, almost from a third person. In the past I have been very irresponsible, but read the labels. They are there for a good reason. Some pharmaceutical lobbyist isn't trying to spoil all your fun by sticking the (do not drink alcoholic beverages) label on your prescription. My friend M and I were at a music festival for one week during the summer of 2003, around the end of June.  We took with us a quarter of boom booms (shrooms), a couple extaordinarily strong tabs (THE strongest acid me of any of my friends had ever had), a half of smoke, and a couple cases of good beer.  It was a crazy festival in a campground that was made for a little trippy hippy community.  It had a great lake and beach, and tons of crazy woods and paths for camping.  I have no idea how many people attended this fest, probably about at least 6,000.Anyways, I had been smoking weed 24/7 this summer, and eating a lot of shrooms, about once or twice a week, and dropped a few times too.  I was in a very surrealistic/partying mindstate as this is how I tend to live my life, still to this day.  My total drug experiences have been lsd 40-60 times, mush 30-40 times, mescaline 2 times, dxm ~4 times, crystal meth ~8 times, cocaine 30-40 times, heroin 10-20 times, ecstasy 5-10 times, all kinds of upper/downer/tranq/whatever pharm pills, and of course I lived my life in a haze of MJ, with some good hash/keef/brownies here and there too.Back to the festival.  M and I had been taking shrooms without a care that summer, along with some of our other friends and it had become no big deal.  It became a spur of the moment thing, and we liked that.  We would get drunk and stoned and munch mad caps like they were nothing.  We loved just unknowingly hurling ourselves into a whirlwind of trippy states.  Well, the second night we were there, we got hammered and smoked a few blunts while partying at our campsite with some other nearby campsites.  So naturally we jumped all over the bag of scibady-dibadies and kept on partying after we ate them.  As always when I'm drunk, it takes a while longer to feel the trip kicking in. For me it kind of mixes in with the alcohol and provides a light-hearted care free base for the trip.  It's almost like a different kind of trip.  Well, at about t+1h we were all fucked up.  I was on my decidely last beer, and we were about to gear up and take a walk around all the campsite areas and trip out and interact with nature and people camping.  I was getting so messed up that I was talking out my ass like I do when I'm drunk and coked up.  I was laughing so hard at everything and the people around M and I were just awed at how screwed up we liked to get.At approximately t+1.5h, we were still fucking around and hadn't left yet.  Yes it took us a half an hour to get our shit together, which consisted of a bowl, some weed, water, and some hoodies cause it was gettin a little chilly out.  The stars were so visible from this area, they sparkled so bright and scoobed all around and faded in and out.  We got not even ten feet from our site to go on our journey when M had an even better idea.  We hopped in the tent and he quickly sliced off some tablature.  If I had to estimate how much fry we each ate, I would say ~200 ug each.  Around the strength of two nice doses each even though the pieces of tab we ate were slightly less than the size of one tab, this shit was so good.  It was supposedly L-25 the almighty government altered lsd, who knows though, all I know is that one tab of that stuff feels like a strong ass five strip.So then we embarked on our walk trippin balls on shrooms already.  We proceeded to smoke a few bowls, and about a half an hour into the walk, I began to feel different in my trip.  The cid was kickin in strong, and M agreed that this was going to get crazy.   This was the first time we have ever tried mixing LSD and mushrooms, as we had wanted to a couple of months ago, but decided against cause we each ate two tabs of this same crazy acid and once we peaked decided against it cause it would have been too much.  These two trips began to meld together and it was insane.  Everything seemed to be outlined in a halo and seemed to look like jello-ish.  People seemed to gravitate towards us as we walked by their camp sites, and we had a hard time reading their intentions.  Conversations with others were kept short and we kept on moving because people seemed like they were out to bust us or hurt us.  Of course that was a ridiculous idea, as they were probably just drunk and or stoned fucking around as people walked by.  At one point some punker girl ran out and swung an axe at me, now I swear it was less than an inch from my head, but my depth perception was non existent.  M and I both ran off into the night blood curdling screams trailing behind us.  M informed the girl that she was in need of crazy pills as we bolted.  So then the best part of the trip took us by surprise.  We smoke a bowl while walking up this totally dark winding path trough the woods and it came out to this plateau where all the people with campers instead of tents were staying.  There was not a single person out, mind you it was about 2 in the morning now, but it seemed so alive.  The way that this combination made colors and shapes, and the crazy jello movement, it seemed teeming with activity.  I would hear and feel buzzing sounds and see sparks of light trailing out of thin air.  The patterns in the pathway were way more intricate and mobile than on just shrooms or cid.  There were all these cheesy different colored hanging bulbs of lights which morphed color and shape and swayed and buzzed out loud.Then, the moment happened.  M and I were both stopped in our tracks when we caught sight of the full moon gleaming through this huge dead tree.  A dead tree in the middle of summer didn't even strike us as strange.  But the way the moon shone through the tree and the way the branches twisted and grew was nuts.  The branches would create growing and flashing light patterns with the moon beams.  Pure insanity.  We were physically and mentally paralyzed with awe.  We must have stood there and watched this light show for what seemed like hours, but really for about 45 minutes.  That was ~t+5h for the shrooms and ~t+3.5h for the cid.  After this we proceeded back to camp.We made it back to camp around 4 in the morning and there was few people left awake around us.  We smoke ourselves stupid with a nearby camper that wandered over to our site.  We just sat and talked around our campsite listenening to some good mellow trippy trance cds and smoking much ganja and finally went to bed around 7 am.What a great night.  Mixed LSD and mushrooms for the first time, and it was at a great place to do it.  It was very intense in the body, mind, and visual realms.  However, it was very light hearted in the spiritual realm of how it affects my soul.  Possibly because I was drunk and stoned first, but that had to of worn off by the time the wicked peak was hit.  I'll never really know I guess, cause I will not repeat this, not cause it was scary, just because I am done with tripping, maybe acid a few more times, but not anytime soon and in small doses.  DOSE: 80 mg oral Pharms - Paroxetine (pill / tablet) \\xa0 10 glasses oral Alcohol - Beer/Wine (liquid)            BODY WEIGHT:   150 lb         I am a Mental Health Provider for the US Army.  As such I am called quite often when someone makes what we call a 'suicide gesture' (id est, taking meds and drinking, and then letting others see this behavior.)  I have some lenient views on recreational drug use, so this is by no means a diatribe against using psychoactive substances.Two weeks ago I was called to assist a Service Member (SM) who had ingested the above amounts of Paxil and Beer over a two hour period.  His stated reasoning was to be able 'to get to sleep.'  W/o going into details of his case (to protect patient privacy, etc) I will relate the immediate and longer term effects.  SM was almost immediately very drowsy, with slurred speech and clouded thought processes.  Of course, 10 beers in two hours will go a long way toward this, but I feel the combination also hit the SM hard.  SM had extreme difficulty staying awake, though pupils were still responsive, breathing was normal, and pulse was strong and steady.SM slept (under observation) for approx 11 hours.  Upon waking SM described sleep troubled by vivid, unremembered dreams.  SM expereinced significant lingering body load throughout the next day, muscle soreness, continued tiredness, lack of focus, some dehydration (no shit, 10 beers) and some joint pain.  SM experienced no long term effects from this combination, but the experience scared the shit out of the person. This report isn't really a warning to anybody, because as bad as it might sound, I really don't feel that it is. It’s as much for the people reading it as it is for me to get things together and organized in my somewhat confused head.  I'm 16 years old right now.  I have been smoking pot just about every day for the past year an a half, maybe a little more.  I took my first drinks about two and a half years ago, but didn’t get more than a buzz till about this time two years ago, over spring break of my 8th grade year.  I had just turned 14.  I remember I drank a few shots of whiskey and a few shots of cherry vodka.  Keep in mind that I was probably about 115 pounds and only 14 years old.  I had the most amazing time of my life, up to then of course.  I kissed a few girls that night, and had fun.This started my pattern of every weekend drinking, then summer came, and I started drinking at least twice a week, but normally three to four times.  At the time a good drunk was 4-5 drinks.  I tended to drink with one kid most of the time, and occasionally a few others. Throughout that summer I felt the need to drink all the time in order to have fun.  That summer I also tried smoking grass for the first time.  My first time I smoked a shitty joint out of regular paper and didn’t feel much.  The next time I tried it, about a month later, I smoked a gram of KB to myself rolled up into a joint.  I remember running to catch up with my friend and it all falling right on top of me. Laughter, light headedness, euphoria, music was rolling through my head that I had no control over. Rain was coming down unbelievably hard and everything was blurry.  All of the sudden the sun came out, I was soaking wet, really stoned for the first time, and had to walk probably about a mile to get to my friends and dry off.It was only two months after that that I started smoking pot regularly with a kid who I would be spending most of my time with up until now, which is over a year and a half later. I’m not the most popular kid in school, I can’t say that I have to many real friends cause I get ditched by them a lot of the time. I stopped drinking for a while when I got into heavy weed smoking.  But that didn’t last long. Five or six months later I drank a lot again.  I started experimenting with more drugs about 8 months after I became a regular smoker, and a year after I got drunk for the first time. I tried mushrooms.  I ate some of them, I don’t really know how many, and me and my friend smoked bubblers most of the night.  I can’t say it was a 'life changing experiance', but it was a start to my experimenting.  Over the summer of 2006 I tried more drugs. I moved into acid and tried some pills like vicodin and ritalin.  I took acid regularly for a few months, then stopped after realizing it got me down pretty bad.  Once I was crying for no real reason the day after I tripped, I didn’t know what it was, but something was really bringing me down.  I had problems with depression in the past, but this was differant.  I stayed away from acid for a little while after that.  The fall of my sophmore year I tried a vast amount of pills.  And I fell in love with my next problem drug, Amphetamine.The first time I took adderall I had no idea that it was a cousin to meth.  I thought meth was a drug only for hard core addicts.  Ampethamines are wonderful. They give me so much influance and euphoria.  I enjoy creative things like writing and drawing, and on amphetamines I could never stop coming up with new ideas.  I was so happy and the world seemed like there was nothing wrong with it. Once I blew a 30 mg and a big line form another pill, I’m guessing it was about 35-40mg of the stuff.  I summed up my ideas about God and religion in a notebook, all in all it was about 5 pages long.I also tired things like xanax, percocet, more vicoden, a lot of ritalin, and ambien.  There are probably a few more in there that I can’t think of now.  That winter something new came along. Cocaine.  I never thought I would be blowing a line of cocaine. Ever. But I did. It became pretty big at my school and I thought why not try it.  I did it probably about 7-8 times in a period of a month, and I loved it.  I spent over a hundred bucks on it in only a short period of time, and got probably about a gram for free.  I didn’t wanna get hooked though. I gave it a rest for a while.In the past few months, to start 2007, I have started drinking more, and a lot of people are saying I am drinking pretty heavily.  I know I am, and I care about it, but I love drinking and I always have.  I care, but I don’t care. I think about alcohol every day and have been smoking pot every chance I get since I got out of rehab. I was in an outpatient program for about 2-3 months because of my parents, I still smoked, I failed almost all my tests but refused to go back, and it worked somehow.  I have also been taking amphetamines and any uppers I can for the past few months once a week if not more.  I always think about them, and can’t write without something to put me in the right state of mind.  Even now, I felt like I needed to sum all of this shit up earlier today, but I wanted to wait to drink more, and get to smoke too before I wrote it, on the basis that it would be a better story if I was high...right?  So as of now I am smoking heavier than ever, drinking more than ever, and always snorting or popping some kind of upper or downer.This may sound like complaining about some sad slow process of slipping into addiction.  I don’t know if that’s what it is really. I know we are all going to die one day, and I’m going to live while I have the chance to live. I consider myself a fairly experienced psychonaut, having had my share of psychedelics, pharmaceuticals, plants etc. One day I found a bag of Acorus calamus root powder which I had purchased from an online vendor during my university years (about 5 years ago). The bag originally contained 50mg of very fine powder but now seemed to contain somewhere between 30 and 35g. I can't remember when or how I had used the powder that was missing, but I had probably mixed it with other stuff, otherwise I would remember. The bag had remained sealed in a dry, dark place. The powder had formed hard rocks but looked otherwise unchanged.I first crumbled the rocks to powder again, by applying pressure on the plastic bag. I took a 350ml bottle of vodka, emptied about 50ml to make space, and used a funnel to pour the powder into the bottle. I closed the lid and shook vigorously. I left the bottle stand for a couple of hours, shaking every once in a while. In retrospect, I could have waited longer for better results. Then, I took another, empty bottle. I put the funnel into the neck of the empty bottle, and a coffee filter inside the funnel. Then I started pouring the vodka and the calamus sludge into the filter, and watched as the honey-colored vodka started dripping into the empty bottle. I left the vodka filter throughout the night, although I suspect it didn't need that long. What I got was a bottle of honey-colored vodka.At the time of the experiment, I was at my home, alone, with no immediate responsibilities and in good psychological state. I had been smoking pot since morning and by the time I started it was 6 in the afternoon. I had half a pizza a few hours earlier so I'm not hungry, I'm not feeling too full either.18:08T+0:00 I poured about a quarter of the extract into a glass and had a small sip to taste it. The liquid had a mild warm/spicy taste that was not too unpleasant, but I mixed the vodka with orange juice so that the alcohol would go down easier.T+0:01 I had a much larger sip, this time the orange juice masked the taste of the alcohol but not the calamus. Again, this was not an unpleasant taste, it is however strong and very distinctive. I can see how some people could find it unpleasant, but I'd say that it goes down fairly easily.T+0:06 I am now half way through my glass and now the taste seems rather unpleasant. I feel a very slight irritation in the stomach, which could be attributed to the alcohol.T+0:13 I finished my glass, by now the taste seemed very bitter and unpleasant. I am feeling mildly drunk from the alcohol, but I hope the main effects will wear off before the TMA-2 kicks in. [Erowid Note: The idea that a chemical in calamus metabolizes to TMA-2 in the body is pure speculation.] I drank a large glass of water too, to prepare for any dehydration that might arise from mixing an amphetamine with alcohol. My experience is that when using psychoactives, one must be careful to stay properly hydrated. Water helps everything get around inside you. I am not planning to drink any more tonight. If my rough estimates are correct (I really should buy a scale to use in my experiments), I have ingested the extract of about 7 to 9 grams of root powder, which I think is more than enough for a first try. And now, to play the waiting game...T+0:26 I am feeling a buzz that I think is different from the drunkenness I am experiencing. The spicy taste that still lingers in my mouth, and the warm, fuzzy feeling both remind me of my nutmeg experiments, and this is something that takes my mind years back to my university days, when I must have purchased the root powder.T+0:50 I am definitely feeling a distinct buzz. I am chatting online with a good friend, and I'm telling her about what I'm doing. My typing skill has not been impared.T+0:58 I notice that my hands are a bit sweaty, and the buzz continues. Nothing special.T+1:04 Now I'm not just feeling a buzz, but a happy sensation, also I'm slightly sleepy in an amphetamine-kind of way. I don't really want to go to sleep, I guess the word I'm looking for is drowsy. I am also feeling a pleasant pressure around my head.T+1:16 I discover that I feel happy and content when I let my eyes slightly lose focus. This is something I have also experienced with drugs from the amphetamine family. I don't like the side-effects of the amphetamines (and that's why I gave up ecstasy/speed/etc a long time ago), but today I am experiencing none of the unpleasant side-effects.T+1:23 I decide to spoil the experiment a bit and light up a J. It intensified the effects slightly.T+1:50 Still feeling buzzed. Pleasant but nothing spectacular. I'm not feeling any of the nausea that is often reported either. Nor do I feel any other unpleasant symptoms. I'm beginning to think that the plant material might have degraded due to me storing it for such a long time.T+2:24 Effects are subsiding.T+2:41 Now I'm close to baseline.Overall it was a pleasant experience, definitely not a placebo, and I plan to repeat it in a few days, maybe stepping up the dosage, since I still have three times as much liquid left as I drank today. But once I run out, I don't think I'll be in any rush to acquire more calamus. For me it was a mild experience but if you are planning to follow my steps keep in mind that the material I used might have lost some potency because I kept it stored for so long. Use caution and common sense and always be safe. Peace. So after a long long thursday of doing work I decided I needed to take a vicodin (hydrocodone) to chill out a little after midnight.  As soon as it kicked it I went and joined my friends who were partying down the street.  They were all quite drunk and I realized that I needed to chill myself out a little more as I was on edge after about 12 straight hours of reading and writing papers and going to class.  So, I crushed up 2 10mg valiums and blew half of the powder, sharing the rest with my friend.  As soon as I walked out of her bedroom my other friend offered me some coke.  I hesitated at first but hearing the crazyness going on in the living room I decided it would be a good idea.  I went into the bathroom when he left it and found a large (for me, I don't do a lot of coke) line, said what the hell, and blew it.By the way, the reason I was doing pharmies instead of drinking in the first place was to prevent getting a hangover so that I could finish a midterm in the morning.  After doing the coke, I felt that I NEEDED a drink.  Initially, the cocktail of uppers and downers made it a little hard to interact, but after about three glasses of wine (I say about because I drank them out of the plastic bag of a franzia box) I saw this really cute girl I have a huge crush on and after feeling sketchy at first, settled into the conversation and had a really good time flirting and talking with her, though we eventually parted ways b/c I have a girlfriend.But, after this we left the apartment and I started to feel GREAT!  The combination of drugs spread a warm euphoria throughout my body and I felt like I could say whatever I wanted, even if I knew it might not make the most sense.  My 3 friends and I stumbled upon a dance on campus that was pretty much empty and was playing absolutely horrible music.  We went in and danced our asses off in the most ridiculous of ways, throwing our bodies around, and having a incredible time of just being stupid and communicating with each other and the music by making fun of it with our bodies.  The feeling inside my mind and body was really unbelievable, a state of being absolutely in the moment and not caring about anything but making the present fun and having a good time.  I finally made it to sleep around 5am, after way more partying and getting fucked up than I had planned.Remarkably, I awoke at 9:30 the next morning feeling perfectly clear minded and lucid with no hangover whatsoever.  The combination of substances was perfect, I would do it every night if it wasn't for the obvious fact that mixing such highly addictive drugs probably isn't a good habit to get into. Living outside of a small town during a particularly snowy winter brought rise to many of experiences quite possibly due to boredom.  To be completely honest, I'm always willing to try new things, but I never took multiple drugs at once.  Granted, marijuana and alcohol are not the most impressive drugs, yet the effect I had during the one evening is probably unlike anything I had ever tried.A friend had bought a liter of vodka, and because alcohol is simply a favorite of mine, I couldn't resist the occassion.  Despite the fact I 'regularly' drink, typically once every weekend, the experience I encountered that evening was a first.  It was no later than 9:30 at night when I arrived at the house.  Before we even took one sip of the vodka, my friend offered me an adderol pill, which can basically be equivolated with speed.  I never tried it before and therefore I was a bit anxious upon taking it.After we had just began to drink, I was beginning to feel a buzz, yet I also felt much more alive and stimulated.  I only had approximately 4-5 shots, or possibly a bit less--it was enough alcohol that I was able to feel 'the giggles' but I wasn't absolutely tanked.  On a normal basis, I probably would have drank more, but the adderol made me feel as though I had just eaten a thanksgiving dinner.  Our friends made a routine stop at the house we were staying at, and we decide that it would be fun to go on a ride and smoke some pot.  At this point, it had to have been an hour since we started to drink, and an hour and a half since the adderol.  I had actually began to feel extremely social, an affect from alcohol I tend to rarely get.  My mindset that evening, in addition, was not particularly outstanding; it was simply an end to a rather tiring day.  On the contrary, the last thing on my mind at the moment was sleeping.After we jumped in the car and packed the bowl, my friend and I were talking to these two people who picked us up as though they weren't even there.  It was very odd--but I believe the adderol just made us extremely hyper.  Naturally, I smoked on a regular basis, but I simply was too apprehensive to ever try it with opium.  Yet my friends tried it before, and they claimed it was a good experience, so I decided that it was a possibility that I enjoy it as well.  Perhaps I just have an extremely weak tolerance, but I am a slender female, and from just smoking a bowl is enough to get me stoned.  So after two bowls of this marijuana sprinkled with opium, I began to feel something unbelievable.  The alcohol and the marijuana alone might have made me pass out.It is extremely unlike me to have energy even while drinking.  I tend to be a rather depressive person when I am on substances.  Therefore this experience was entirely new.  Once I began to feel the opium kick in, I could have just chilled all night in that car, smiling up at the stars.  I have never before been in such a clear state of mind.  Ideas were flowing through my head, the most obscure ideas.  I believe the opium just made my body completely at ease.  I certainly did not experience a bad high at all because the regular paranoia of simply marijuana had been entirely eliminated.To feel the enhanced humor from the alcohol and the rate of time completely slowed from the marijuana, along with throwing in adderol and opium, made my body feel so weightless.  Every step I took on the snow-covered grass left an imprint on my shoe, and the sound of myself breathing in the cold air was all the entertainment I needed to suffice.  My vision was a bit in slow motion, yet all of the noises were definitely enhanced.  I sat in the car talking about useless information, yet I payed no attention to the sound of my own voice, but to the sound of the motor running in the car.  It actually startled me to know that I had no idea what I was saying, nor that I could remember what I had just said.  Ironically, because everything had slowed down visually, I was analyzing nearly everything in my brain, and I was spilling all of my thoughts out loud.My friend made some unbelievable statements that I shall never forget because they are so wild and almost revolutionary.  However, I regret to say that I had completely lost track of time.  The whole experience is simply so jumbled; parts are missing, other parts are completely enhanced.  In fact, had it not been for the fact that once we were back at the house we had written down these statements she made, I probably would have forgotten them by the morning.  One of the more noticable qualities of the experience that stood out in my mind is when I finally checked the clock, it was around 4 o'clock in the morning, and the effects of the night were finally beginning to wear down.  At that point I nearly collapsed into bed.  My night came to an absolutely abrupt end, yet from the things I can manage to remember, it was quite the experience. In the Winter of 2006, I was visiting a few friends of mine in Ohio. I had moved to Tennessee 8 months ago, and visit them as often as possible. We're always up for new ideas, and always experimenting. The first few days I was in town, we really wanted to score some grass. Where I used to live it's relatively easy to score, and always fairly priced. We didn't score until a later date though, due to people being out of town and it being a major Holiday week.So, in the end, we got some beers. Then I drove us all down to the local college to buy cigarettes. Once we arrived at our destination, an attic apartment of a friend who was out of town, we got busy. We first found his beer bong, and decide because of how little beer we had (Roughly 4 each), we should down them quickly. Right beside the beer bong, however, was a water bong. This is where things started to get interesting.After we all beer bonged one beer each, we all packed a huge bowl of tobacco into the water bong. We'd pass this bowl until dry, then bong a single beer each again. Then we repeated the pattern. Around the third pass of the water bong, we all realised we were a bit out of it. High if you will. After a toke of 15-20 seconds, I'd get a huge buzz that lasted up to five minutes. When the night was over though, these highs seemed to last up to 25 minutes!!! Note: The water bong was home made, and was never used before. Due to this factor alone we are positive we smoked nothing but tobacco that night.We had no clue what was going on, but went with it anyway. We put a picture of a sunset over mountains on top of a ping-pong table, and sat at the couch near the end of it. We then played Immortal Technique's 'Dance With the Devil.' I closed my eyes and visualized the entire song in a dreamlike form. This may be due to the fact my name is William (Main characters name in the song). My two friends saw people climbing the mountains in the paintings. We weren't high anymore. We were tripping very mildly, or at least using our artistic views on the song and painting to their extremes.We're not sure how it or what exactly did happen that night, but that tobacco fucked us up. We tried the experiment with three different kinds of cigs and all worked. We may never find out what happened, as erowid mentions nothing of these effects. Whatever it may be though, we may all remember it for quite some time. Before I begin, I must warn all readers that this experience was nothing rational, logic died on this night like an elephant shot full of LSD and thorazine. This experience started out as something mild, and turned into something incredible. The setting was a party at a friend of a friend's place, it was slow, not much happened, very little to say about it. It was when everyone else left or went to sleep that myself, C and M started in heavy.Our travel-bag drug collection for the night sounded like something Hunter S. Thompson would be proud of. We had a half oz of cubensis, a pony keg of beer, bottle of absinthe, bottle of crown, a whole world of dextroamphetamine and an extensive collection of other pharmasuiticals, yet strangely enough, no weed in sight. For raw quantity, we estimate that between the 3 of us, we drained about 2/3rds of the keg, finished the absinthe and crown, went through some other beers, and hit the dex with around 40mg each, give or take. We also managed 1/4 of a bottle of rum that fell victim to the after-party some time around early dawn.The experience was largely an irresponsible yet not entirely shallow feeling. It felt like a cosmic mistake we were destined to exploit. The three of us sat there in a city 4 hours away from our home town, pool side at a large house with a sauna and hot tub to boot, plus an enormous outdoor fireplace. The killer is that we didn't know or particularly care for the host of the party, yet some how all 3 of us were there. The main theme for the night was a row of about a dozen clay toads at the edge of, and sitting in the outdoor fireplace. The mix of drugs naturaly gave way to their anthropomorphisization, and some became even so important as to have individual names. Most of these are not important, as they only took up small skits on the side of conciousness through the night. One of these toads, however, deserves greater mention. Fuckass the Toad was his official name. He was an asshole of a toad, sitting there in a corner by himself- he was painted the same, yet none of us seemed to like him. He wasn't a loner by choice, he was more of a distant tyrant of toads; something we looked upon with disgust. As the night progressed, we found ourselves mistreating this self-appointed dictator.The treatment of the toad fitted the conversation all too well of course, us simple three wondering what cosmic mistake landed us at this party. We spent time talking about the ruling class and the kind of disgusting excess we were sitting in; M enjoyed it, while C and I had other plans. We doused fuckass in absinthe and whisky then lit him on fire- no damage done to the kiln fired toad of course, but the symbolism counted. This night was a sort of a mockery of opulence, a satire of the upper class.We mixed absinthe in draft beer just to giggle at the contradiction of the two. It was called rooster snot, because the head on the keg's hose looked a bit like a cartoon rooster, and mixing amber beer with blue (low quality) absinthe made it look green. It tasts as good as it sounds, and all three of us pray the two forms of alcohol never meet again in the same container.All through the night the neighbours fence played tricks on us too. Some how the light shining through the boards made the entire thing look like an oceanside view. A dense row along the top looked like a coastline in a bay, with a bridge going across it. lines runing below looked like boats and reflections of the bridge. The boards also seemed to breath and bend, almost like waves occasionally. Essentially this inebriated state carried on much the same, active and creative, the conversation never stopped between 1am and 6am. By about 3am C had thrown it in for the hope it would sink, and that we would stop poisoning ourselves. No such luck, fuckass the toad owned that night, he became an idol; the god of mistakes in the highest supernatural order.So we continued drinking after hauling the pony keg out, and finnished the absinthe. The conversation is largely forgotten, most of it was muttering conspiracy theories and grandios plans in circles between each other. It was the emotions that mattered- there was an energy both destructive and positive, yet misdirected and apathetic. The thujone, pislocybin and dex fueled our mind, but the ethynol made sure we stayed put. And we did, outside of a one hour journey to a corner store and back around 5am.I would say this trip is something to be repeated at a lower does. It is beyond me how none of us managed to end up with alcohol poisoning, being drown or ending up a burn victim. We also managed not to attract attention from the cops, or the neighbours. Despite all this, while my description wasn't too bright, emotionally the experience it was like touching a different, beautiful world. Here's my tale of how ephedrine has adversely affected my life in many different ways.I first started taking it while I was in the military.  One of my buddies handed me four tablets (100mg) every time our squad got assigned to KP duty.  Oh, how it made the day fly by so much quicker.  I only took it occasionally while I was in the Army.  After the Army, I got a job working night shift in a convenience store.  The stuff was readily available, and it wasn't long till I was taking the stuff every night.  Within a year I was taking about 300mg a day.  My body was building a resistance and I had to take more to get the same effects.About 1998, those pills started to really cause me problems.  I was taking so many I couldn't hardly sleep.  I might get 2-3 hrs a night then every 3rd night or so crash for 12 hrs.  To combat this I started drinking every night...  So here begins the vicious cycle.  Wake up with hangover, immediately take ephedrine to counteract that and get energy...  then have to drink ever larger amounts to shut the ephedrine down.  In 1999 I got my CDL and became an over the road truck driver.  For the next 2 and a half years I didn't drink much, but my ephedrine ramped up to 500-600mg a day.  That's 24 pills folks.  In the industry ephedrine is referred to as trucker's speed.  From 2001 to present I've worked local delivery but until this year I took roughly the same amount per day.  Lets talk about side effects.  Sweat.  I was constantly hot and sweated buckets.  I had to drink tons of water to stay hydrated.  I was restless and my hands were always trembling.  I had trouble with my speech...  I would know what I wanted to say but really had trouble with words and names...  My heart rated was elevated all the time and my blood pressure was about 20 points above normal.IMPORTANT:  When I drink while using ephedrine, it disables some of the things that protect me from alcohol poisoning.  1) It keeps me awake.  Passing out is one of my bodies best signs I am past my limit.  Since I stopped I can only drink half of what I used to.  2) I believe it suppresses the urge to vomit when drinking too much, at least it did with me.  Vomiting is the bodies last ditch effort to save itself from alcohol poisoning.  I got to where I could put down an entire 5th of hard liquor without passing out or vomiting.  Now that I dropped the mini-thins, I can only drink half as much, and have been sick twice in the last 3 months.Quitting --  I decided to quit after they changed the law in my state on July 1, 2005.  I can still get it, but it is not exactly OTC anymore, you have to sign a log and the states tracks you.  The first two weeks cold turkey were downright brutal.  I could hardly get out of bed and go to work.  It was like having the flu.  Then there were nightmares.  For years my brain had not been able to sleep deep enough for me to dream, and when it got the chance, it went nuts.  All in all it took about a month for me to feel normal.I know this was lengthy, but I felt it was needed.  Most of what has been posted seems to stem from occasional recreational use...  To put it in words a younger person might understand, this explains how bad I got owned by this drug.Thx for reading. A few days ago I managed to get my hands on some pills called methadone. I wasn't exactly sure what they were at first but I soon found out. They were just used to treat opium addiction. Last night a few of my buddies and I decided to go camping out. I have had the pills for a while now, I was just alittle nervous about taking them, especially out in the middle of the woods. I asked my friends if something went wrong and I had an allergic reaction would one of them be sober enough to drive me to the emergency room, several of them said yea dont worry about it. I took one 10 mg pill at about 8 pm as we were sitting around the camp-fire.I didn't really feel a thing until about an hour later. My body started tingling and I just felt real good. I thought to myself, I guess this is all the pills are going to do to me, I'll be fine if I drink a few beers. After I drank about 2 beers I was feeling great, I honestly can't describe it. I can really tell why these pills are so addictive, I absolutely love the way they made me feel.I drank about 3 more beers and as soon as I finished number 5 one of my friends showed up with some reefer. I told him I was really messed up and he asked me if I wanted to smoke. Of course I said yea. We went to his SUV and smoked 2 bowls out of my pipe. I was feeling fine and walked back to the fire. When I went to go sit down that was when I realized I was extremely messed up, the marijuana just increased my high from the pill.It was 23 degrees and I couldn't feel a thing, the weather seemed like a perfect spring day. At about 12 I had to go back to my friends house that I was spending the night with. I walked into his kitchen and all of a sudden everything started spinning in one giant circle, kind of like when your drunk but 10 times worse. But I never got sick from it.I laid down and fell asleep at about 1 am. I woke up the next day at around 12 pm and I felt sort of out of it. My body was still pretty  numb and I felt just relaxed. I figured the pill would have worn off by now, 24 hours after I took it. Overall it was a great experience but I would reccomend being extremely careful in taking them. I've took many differnt kinds of pills but nothing was like taking methadone. I honestly don't know if I would ever take one again because I can get an endless supply of them. That would be really difficult to explain to my parents why their 16 year old son is addicted to synthetic heroin. The PreparationI still have 6 blue Xanax tablets purchased from a friend of mine who has a prescription and a 12 pack of beer in the refrigerator.  Tonight I have planned to get very inebriated.  I like the buzz you get with Xanax and alcohol.  I'm an experienced user of Xanax and I am very familiar with its effects and I'm even familiar with it's effects mixed with alcohol.  I get an amplified feeling of well being,  relaxation,  happiness.  One thing I was not prepared for this night was the fact that, if overdone, you can receive undesired effects.T+ 0.00 minI take a 1 mg blue xanx and take a swig out of the first beer.  I am just watching TV at this point and I continue to drink my beer and flip through the channels.  I know that I am watching TV for now but later on will probably not be interested in TV because I will be in a different state of mind.T+ 20.0 minI decided to put in a new video game I have purchased and play it.  I enjoy things while on Xanax more I think because it calms me down and allows me to really soak everything in instead of letting my mind wander.  I can definitely feel the first Xanax kicking in now because I have begun consumption on an empty stomach.  T+ 45.00 minMy first beer is gone,  I have had only one beer yet I feel as if I have had 2 or 3 really.  I decide I want to take this even further as it was a long day at work and I have been looking forward to this moment.  I get another beer and another 1 mg pill and I dose again.  This is where things go pretty wierd.I'm going to try my best to remember as much as I can but this stuff can really mess with my memory and I can only remember bits and pieces after taking the second blue xanax and finishing my second beer.  What I do remember is this.T+ 60.0 minI am simply just feeling the vibes of this stuff,  I feel like the xanax and alcohol have taken over and it's all I can feel. I feel overwhelming joy and relaxation.  I feel as if I am in a trance, locked on to the TV which I thought I would lose interest in but damn xanax can put you in a trance.  I decide to get up and walk around.  I fix many different things to eat, a frozen dinner, toast, spaghetti.  I had the munchies from hell but it was only because I hadn't eaten almost all day,  not because I was smoking weed, the only weed I had smoked all day was early in the morning about 16 hours prior to the ingestion of xanax so I don't really think that has any relevance in this report.  Something really scary about this part of the experience is that I took another Xanax but I myself do not remember taking it, I only know I took it because of how many I had the next day.  The very last thing I remember is feeling zombie like and fixing a bowl of honey combs.The next morningI wake up feeling slightly groggy but I don't feel terrible.  As I walk out of my bedroom my mom asks me how I'm feeling. I tell her I'm just a little hung over because I drank too much last night and this is where is just gets wierd.  My mom says she woke up at 4 a.m. to use the bathroom and she saw me sitting on the couch with a bowl in my lap, cereal and milk all over my clothes, the floor, the couch.  She said my head was slumped forward, drool and milk pouring from my mouth.  She told me she got very scared and shouted my name loudly but got no response.  She said she repeatedly called my name but I made no response as if I were dead.She told me that she even tried shaking me and nothing happened so then she just hauled off and smacked the hell out of my face.  She says I woke up, just snapped out of it and asked her why she was so freaked out.  She told me to go to bed angrily.  Let me state right now, I do not remember ANY of this.  I don't remember waking up from the coma I guess you could call it, I don't remember her shouting my name and I don't remember getting up and going off to bed.  That's not cool.I want to add that I ate lots of food throughout this because I felt like it would help keep me straight.  Call me paranoid but I think I could have died that night,  gone into a permanent coma and stopped breathing or who knows.  I am glad I am alive and I have full motor functions.  I am completely fine.  I have learned my lesson about mixing alcohol and xanax uncarefully, it is dangerous. On the fifth day of no booze or Effexor-- after almost a week of teeth-gnashing-- bedridden depression a neighbor woke me to get back a copy of “The Fog of War” a documentary on Joe McNamera (secretary of war during Vietnam) in order to take it back to the video store.  I came to the door in a haze-- having worn the same shirt and boxers for 5 days.  I hadn’t showered since two days after Christmas.  Personal hygiene isn’t high on the list when I’m pondering committing yourself or leaping into on coming traffic.  I handed him the DVD and returned to my room --putting a shirt over my head to shield my usually sensitive eyes from afternoon sunlight which was peering through cracks in my blinds.  My mattress was on the floor-- as I had never bothered to obtain a proper bed, there were no sheets, only a denim comforter that I snuggled with in the classic fetal position.   This was the only way I could sleep as it gave me a feeling of comfort and safety. Upon cessation of Effexor, I had been sleeping 16 hours a day during the ordeal-- fortunately I was able to trade some of my Adderall for Klonopins. I was certainly experiencing both SSRI and alcohol withdrawal simultaneously-- I had been drinking as well as experiencing depression to a debilitating degree for over a month and I felt it was time to get my mind back-- what was left of it.After my neighbor left I was unable to sleep so  I made coffee and smoked half a cigarette lying in my ashtray.  I finally felt close to normal.   After a shower and clean clothes I felt almost normal. No electric shocks or clouded memory. Another side-effect of Effexor withdrawal that I experienced was pressure in the eyes.  I’m not certain the cause-- though I expect it could be a indication of pressure somehow exerted on the brain.  The withdrawal period wasn’t as bad as it had been during previous attempts to stop despite the fact I didn’t taper down gradually as recommended by others that had gone through a similar withdrawal.  The sedative definitely helped me with the insomnia and other physical symptoms.  I seriously doubt I would have been able to abstain from Effexor with out them.  My dreams were so vivid during the detox period that I often mistook them for reality-- I attribute this to a mixture of REM rebound from the cessation of my alcohol consumption and the absence of the SSRI in my bloodstream.  They were 100 times more concrete and my mind seemed to be sharper in dream than it was in reality.  I can only compare it to the several times I intentionally fell asleep while wearing nicotine patches-- most of which warn against applying them before sleep due to “Vivid Dreaming”.  The metabolic process of alcoholism have stopped functioning-- hopefully leaving me with only a psychological addiction, which I intend to battle feverishly.  I no longer crave booze in any form, though my craving for cigarettes has probably doubled.  I took a triple dose of multivitamins because cells inundated with alcohol have a terribly difficult time obtaining nutrients and most alcoholics suffer from vitamin deficiencies. In November of 2002, I was a college senior and quite the chemical sponge. I was experimenting with many different combinations of substances and settings, as I was free to do so at that stage in my life. Most of my experiences started with research on Erowid, and ended in a pleasant nights sleep. With graduation on the horizon, and that inevitable search for my first internship, I knew I had to keep my body clean of illegal substances, or at least less riddled with them. For the past few weeks, I had been experimenting with legal highs with mixed results. Passion Flower, Salvia, Nutmeg, and Catnip, my choice for this particular night. My setting should sound familiar to most people. A 10” by 15” college dorm, lit with clear Christmas tree lights. Comfy chair, computer, and soft music. My mind, as with every time I indulge, was very excited, eager, and slightly nervous. By this time, I knew what preparations to take, environment wise, to ensure I would not be caught doing whatever I was doing, so that eased my mind slightly. This included taping doors to prevent smoke from escaping, a fan in the window, and help if something bad happened, like having a friend only two doors down. However, I was trying something new, so I was more excited than normal.I had read weeks earlier that Catnip could be used to alter a persons mental state to some degree. I had purchased and smoked some a few days before, but with no results to speak of. However, I've read enough experiences to know if at first you don't succeed, try mixing things. This night I just happened to have a six pack of Smirnoff Ice to go along with my Catnip. I chugged the first bottle, and started a second. I could feel the warm sensation in my belly that alcohol causes, then packed and quickly smoked a bowl of Catnip using my water bong.At this point I must say that Catnip is by no means smooth or pleasant. It's harsh, it stinks, and tastes pretty bad. This only caused me to drink more. This pattern continued for about 10 minutes until I had smoked two full bowls and drank two and a half bottles of the sugary brew. At first I noticed nothing out of the ordinary. I decided to visit a friend of mine at work (he worked unsupervised at a computer lab) to kill some time. Over the next 15 minutes, I noticed that my vision became much sharper, almost pixilated. As I walked to the computer lab, passing people, I felt very paranoid. However it was a very fun paranoid, like “I know something you don't”. When I reached the computer lab, my friend noted that I was grinning. After sitting down, I realized that I felt much more drunk than I should have, considering the small amount of alcohol I actually consumed. I was somewhat giddy, drunk, and slightly euphoric all at the same time. I had never had alcohol effect me in this way, so it must have been the addition of the catnip. Colors were slightly more vivid, my vision was sharper, and everything sounded tinny. These effects lasted for about an hour, which is about how long that much alcohol could possibly effect my body. His shift ended, we got some food, and headed to his dorm and invited some friends. Within 30 minutes, I was very tired. I drifted off to sleep for about 30 minutes, then woke, and returned to my own room where I slept very deeply for 9 hours. I woke up the next day tired, but it was a pleasant tired, like I had just made love. After getting around, I felt no negative side effects from either the alcohol or catnip and was able to function normally. I feel that, had I continued both drinking and smoking the catnip, I could have maintained those sensations I described. In a bar setting, I could see catnip being a very nice friend. I must note one possible negative effect of catnip outside of its bad taste. I've read from several sources that catnip stimulates the bowels. I myself experienced this, it was similar to a normal dose of laxative the day after I smoked it. Not enough to cause discomfort, but it was noticeable. I've smoked salvia several times before.  I've seen some pretty intense stuff.  I once thought I was a chicken wing.  I once believed that the world did not exist outside of my field of vision.  This experience goes far beyond any of that.It was the 4th of July.  A friend of mine from high school who I don't see often came to visit.  The evening started off with hamburgers and beer.  By the time the fireworks were over I'd had about 15 beers.  I was fairly intoxicated.  I went to my room with friends and we smoked a hookah for a while.  At some point I smoked a little marijuana.  Then I decided that it would be a good idea to smoke some salvia.I grabbed the bong that I had made a few days earlier.  I packed a giant bowl with about 1/3 gram of 10x salvia.  I smoked the whole bowl in 2 rather large lungfuls.  According to my friend, at this point I dropped the bong and fell out of my chair onto the floor.  Apparently I also crawled across the room a little bit.What happened inside my head is something I can barely explain.  I went to some far off distant world.  I had no concept of the reality I've known for most of my life.  All of my senses were overwhelmed with new and different things that I had never experienced before.  My vision zoomed rapidly from one intense sight to another.  Unfortunately I don't think any description can do justice to what I experienced.Slowly I returned to reality.  It was very difficult.  I had totally forgotten about my previous life.  As it returned to me I had to exert quite a bit of effort to grab a hold of it.  It almost seemed as though the distant world I had been to was reality and everything else in my life had just been a dream.  Peak effects probably lasted about 10 minutes.  Fairly strong after-effects persisted until I went to bed about an hour later.I'm pretty sure that the intensity of this experience was related to all of the alcohol I had consumed. The first time I drank alcohol, I was 14 years old. During my freshman year of high school, I began dating a boy named C. One Friday night he and I went to a party. C was a junior, older than I, and his friends were big metal heads who drank and smoked and did drugs while listening to Pantera. I had never had alcohol at that point, but when C offered me a beer, I accepted it.He got me a Beck's (I'm a vegan) and a Coors for himself. My first sample made me grimace a bit. It tasted like a stale, bitter tea but after a couple of mouthfuls, I got used to it. An hour later, I had finished 3 bottles of the stuff.Three beers may seem petty even for a first time drinker, but for a little girl on an empty stomach, it was excessive. I began feeling nauseous and dizzy and my head was pounding. When I went into the bathroom, I saw my reflection, pale and sweating in the mirror. I told C I wasn't feeling well and he drove me home. He helped me up to my room and stayed with me until I fell asleep.When I woke up at around 2 in the morning, the first thing I did was run to the bathroom and vomited. Up the beer came, looking not much different than it had when I first drank it. After successfully emptying myself of the horrid stuff, I took a shower, dressed in clean clothes and went back to sleep.Due to the less than wonderful reaction I had with alcohol my first time, I stayed away from alcohol for a time. The following summer though, my own friends started drinking. Whenever they offered me a beer or a shot, I always turned it down. This usually meant I was the only sober one of the group, but it never bothered me much. They knew of my last unfortunate experience with alcohol, but blamed it on the beer being bad or something of that sort.So I agreed to give it another try. B, W, L, M and A won the rights to 'pop my drinking cherry' after a tumultuous rock-paper-scissor battle. We all gathered in W's room with a big bottle of Jack Daniels and 6 shotglasses and started drinking. They knocked back their shots like nothing. Hard liquor tasted even worse than beer, I figured out. Beer was unpleasant, but at least it didn't burn a hole in my throat on the way down. To the delight of my friends, I drank my first glassful like someone would with tea, sipping it tentatively and ended up coughing. They taught me how to throw back my head and take a shot properly. It still burned like mad and tasted disgusting, but I kept drinking anyway.I can't recall how much time passed, but it was a lot. I had 8 shots and the rest of them had done about 12 or 13. They were all very drunk and giggly and retarded and funny. But I wasn't feeling drunk at all. Just sort of sleepy. And my legs felt heavy. No double vision or incoherent slurring. I wondered if something was wrong with me.And then suddenly, it hit me. All of a sudden I felt very, very, very sick. Sicker than I had ever been in my entire life. I felt as if I was going to die. The ground beneath me began twirling and the mouths of my friends were not coinciding with the words they were speaking. It was like one of those scenes in a movie just before the character blacks out. I swayed, no longer having enough balance to sit up straight and Derek caught me before I hit the floor. I looked up at him and said quite placidly 'I feel ill'.As tanked as they all were, they somehow got together enough coordination to get me to the bathroom. B carried me to the toilet and two seconds later, with someone carefully holding back my hair, I threw up violently for what seemed like forever. My stomach heaved up the rejected liquor repeatedly until I was weak and empty and half dead. I woke up the next morning dehydrated as hell. I brushed my teeth and washed my face and went downstairs to the living room to find five guys sleeping in their boxers with the porn channel still playing on the television. I cannot remember the rest of the night too lucidly, but from what I heard they called my parents and told them I was sleeping over at W's. Then they carried me into his bedroom, tucked me into bed, debated whether or not to undress me and in the end, took off my shoes and left a wastebasket next to the bed.It's been 3 years since that incident and to this day, I rarely drink. It just makes me feel terrible and I hate the taste. I don't mind not drinking at parties even though everyone else around me for miles is chugging down beer and vodka. I am the ultimate non-drinker.Maybe in my next life, I can be an alcoholic.  [Erowid Note: Our understanding of the literature is that there is no such thing as safe recreational use of volatile solvents, aerosols and other street inhalants : their psychoactive effects are inseparable from nerve and organ damage. We have chosen to include these reports to help document the real world use of inhalants, but their inclusion is not intended to imply that they are anything but dangerous.]  About 50ml, one of the largest amouts I have taken, of synthesized distilled diethyl ether was placed into a plastic 2 liter coke bottle for inhaling (the rag method is inadequate, as the ether evaporates needlessly), and 10ml was poured into a vodka and coke and chugged down the hatch.I could feel a slight tingling in my fingertips within seconds of a few inhalations, the all-too-familiar creeping numbness starting from the chest, and moving in all directions slowly outwards, continued inhalations produced ever growing dissociation, and a peculiar sort of mental hallucination, that is almost utterly devoid of visual activity, instead consisting of racing thoughts, great enhancement of music, and ease of conversation, as I was at the time, conversing with a friend via the internet. I decided to put on some music, all heavy stuff, or melodic/operatic black metal, such as Kittie, Skrewdriver, Mudvayne, Draconian and A Perfect Circle, which seemed to fit adequately with the dissociative trippy headspace as provided by ether intoxication.At the time, although I almost never take alcohol, I decided it would be a good idea to mix up a cocktail of 1/2 of a halfpint mug of vodka, 20ml of ether and topped it off with coke. Normally, I abhor the taste of spirits, but due to the ether, my entire body was numbed, so I managed to down the entire mug in one without feeling any but the slightest trace of the fierce ethanolic vitriol that is cheap vodka, some slight degree of stomach discomfort was felt in a short time, but that was mild and transient, merely stomach fullness due to the CO2 in the carbonated coke, misinterpreted by my body as nausea, probably because of the ingested ether numbing the stomach walls somewhat.It is quite a strange feeling, being pissed out of one's cranial cavity for the first time in the best part of 2 years, and stranger still, is the feeling of being pissed as a skunk, whilst simultaneously intoxicated on diethyl ether, flying around in one's own mind, nevertheless, an enjoyable feeling, which continued on for several hours, after which, I slept soundly. The entire trip was done alone, starting at around 12am. The funny thing was, throughout the entire intoxication, it felt that time was passing as extremely slowly, like I had been high as shit for the best part of half a day or so, but upon retiring for the night, a glance at my watch made it known, that the time was only 3.30, so much experience, condensed into a few hours, yet it felt like days had passed. First off I am 19 and well researched and experienced regarding psychoactives of all kinds.  My report is concerning my last experience with a gram of 10x extracted leaf I have purchased off the net.  I had an exactly .15 gram dose of 10x Salvia extract remaining and planned to undergo one more experience.  I had my last experience earlier in the day and due to its intensity I decided to wait awhile before I would smoke my last dose.  For these were my initial intentions.  What ended up happening was in fact quite different.I ended up drinking around ten shots of vodka and became quite intoxicated.  Around three hours later I was feeling better, but still heavily buzzed.  I wandered into my friend Brian’s room and he somehow found out that I had received my Salvia extract and that I had some left.  Being a lover of drugs, my friend pressured me into letting him try the extract since I had already experienced it.  I felt his desire and soon agreed to his request.  I packed the .15 gram into the bowl and told him to rip it as hard as he could.  My friend took three huge hits and held all of them  in very long.  By the time he exhaled the 3rd hit, he proceeded to get up off the bed, drool profusely, and fall flat on his ass to the floor.I saw that he had not even finished off the bowl, so I decided I would take the last hit.  Bad idea!  I took a big hit to finish off the bowl and within seconds I ceased to perceive reality in any conventional manor.  I felt an intense psychedelic rush and reacted in terror rather than euphoria.  I felt like I was catapulted into another dimension and proceeded to stumble down the hall towards my room immersed in a completely dissociated state.  I recall standing in the entrance to my dorm and feeling totally alien to my surroundings.  Familiarity was an extinct player in an extraterrestrial game in which I felt no escape.  Everything seemed to be a lose-lose situation.  I was lost in the truest sense of the word.  I felt misplaced in a dimension where I didn’t belong.  I was truly in a state of panic.  I had no recollection of basic reality and felt that I didn’t have a proper place anywhere in the universe.  I failed to be aware of things as basic as where my room was located.  This entire period of chaos lasted a mere 5 minutes.  The terror I felt however, seemed to last far longer.  When I made my way back to the room I had so clumsily exited five minutes previous, Brian had returned back to normal and spoke of his experience being the most intense of his life.  Mind you, this is an individual whom has consumed a quarter ounce of mushrooms and holds extensive experience with drugs of all kinds.  Brian explained that he felt reduced in size as if he was a small player in a video game.  He said he felt like he was being watched and that the people around him were condemning him.  He was so shocked by the intensity of the experience that he couldn’t stop talking about it and vowed to one day purchase a gram of the extract and have any disbelievers try it for themselves.My prior alcohol consumption indefinitely played a role in the craziness of my experience.  I feel this way because, though I was no longer heavily intoxicated, the alcohol was still very much in my system.  I assume that the alcohol altered the course of the experience because I had never achieved such dramatic results from only one inhalation of the extract.  Upon taking the one hit I was thrown into a dissociated state that resembled effects from three separate levels of Salvia experience.  The effects from the alcohol were most likely felt regarding the trips amnesic effects.  The alcohol consumption also could have aided the ushering in of an immaterial existence aspect of the trip, which would have never been experienced by myself with less than a full smoking dose.  Because my one-hit trip was so intense, I clearly realize that alcohol alters the overall intensity of the Salvia experience.  My mixture of the two resulted in terror and what anyone would call a “bad trip.”  For this reason I would strongly advise against this crazy combination.  Salvia alone is far more powerful than most could handle.  Overall, my 5th and final major experience once again left me speechless in light of Salvia’s unique power.  The experience best resembled a terrible nightmare, yet still proved worthwhile and provided me with a psychedelic ordeal I will not soon forget. I have always built tolerances to prescription meds pretty fast. Lorazepam was no exception. The average dose (2mg) worked once for me and then did nothing. I experimented a few times within the 2mg-5mg range. Still nothing. I had a prescription for it but never took it because, well, it didn’t work. So I had a lot left. (I do not remember much of this experience but this is all that I remember and then I was told what happened)2PM: I hadn’t eaten anything for about a week and was starting to feel sick and very weak. I took 4mg of lorazepam. I tried to eat a bit of something and thing I managed to keep down a slice of toast. I drank one can of beer. At this point I was feeling good. I no longer felt sick or weak. I got a bit of a buzz off the beer but was not feeling the lorazepam.4 to 6PM: I went to one of my weekly meetings and brought another can of beer with me disguised in a green tea bottle. I took another 4mg of lorazepam and drank the bottle during the meeting. By the end I was feeling pretty tipsy and goofy which doesn’t happen to me off of just 2 beers. 6:30PM: I got home and started to feel even more weak and sick. I thought it was from finally eating and drinking something after a week (which was probably true).  I was starting to get shaky and wobbly. I decided to just ignore this and watch TV.10PM: My inability to walk properly didn’t look like it was because I was drunk, it looked more like I was very ill and too weak. My mom asked what was up and I told her how I had just eaten something and my body wasn’t handling it well. She was on her way to bed and said to me “if it gets any worse tell me and I’ll take you to the hospital.' Being the self-destructive person that I am, I took this as an invitation to just fuck myself up. (Here is where the amnesia starts to kick in)11PM: I went upstairs to my room and I don’t really know what was going on, but I know for a fact that I drank another beer and took 1mg of lorazepam. I am a self-injurer and I don’t remember it but I had cut my arm fairly seriously. (I had apparently done some nerve damage because to this day I still don’t have feeling in part of my arm.) I wrapped it up and went to my mom’s room and she later told me that I said “I can’t walk anymore. Can you take me to the hospital?” And she did. 11:30PM: At this point my memory of what happened consists of pieces of images and a few words here and there. We got to the hospital and from what I’ve heard I had absolutely no ability to stand up on my own. I had to be wheeled in sitting in a wheelchair. I got to the ER front dest and told the nurse that I had injured myself and needed stitches and couldn't walk anymore because I wasn't eating.4AM: The doctor stitched me up.  It was also the same doctor who had done my stitches 2 weeks prior to this event so he insisted that I had to speak to the crisis team. My mom left to go speak to my psychiatrist upstairs.  While waiting I popped the remaining 3mg of lorazepam in fear of being admitted and being searched resulting in them taking it away. Crisis told me that I had to be admitted and if I refused, they we’re going to have to call security. At this point I was really upset and yelling and swearing and just freaking out because I have been admitted to the psych unit too many times and really did not want to be admitted again.They said we would take a break for me to calm down and suggested I go out for a cigarette to help me relax. I agreed and wheeled myself out. Instead of going out for a smoke I wheeled myself to the elevators and up to the floor where my psychiatrist and mom we’re. I know I was furious and planning to yell my ass off. Around 8AM?: I got off the elevator and found my mom waiting and began to freak out telling her that they we’re going to admit me. My psychiatrist showed up and wheeled me into his office where he then placed chairs around me so I couldn’t wheel myself away. I was told that I started swearing at him and yelling some more. At one point I was so angry that I tried to get up and leave to go home (stupid idea). I took one step towards the door and then started to collapse. My doctor caught me and carried me back to my wheelchair and then wheeled me into the unit. He lifted me up onto my bed and he sat on the bed with me to try to talk to me. I was told that I fell asleep right away.The next three days I do not remember at ALL but I do remember waking up with a band aid on the inside of my elbow indicating that they had done a blood test. It was also after 3 days that I first noticed I had cut myself. That was pretty shocking. No one mentioned me taking any pills but they did mention that I was drunk which I then denied saying there’s no way I would ever get drunk off of 3 beers.

Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] Went to this trance rave at the Stratford Rex called 1500 micrograms with this chick and her sister etc. Started drinking and smoking weed straight away then dropped the three trips and drank and smoked loads more. At about 5am I bumped into a friend and he said 'have some k' so I said 'give me a line' and he just gave me a note and said snort it out of the wrap so I did. Sniffed as much as I could up each nostril one after the other, must have been about 0.5g, then immediately these sort of cogs rose up from the bottom of my vision, drowning me. I squinted watching the ravers bobbing and moving and the lights. I think I might have sat down or just slumped on the dance floor.I was in limbo, and I could see spirals coming at me with heads on the end. The heads were telling me 'you're going to hell' but I said 'I know hell hell doesn't exist'. To this they replied 'hell must exist if you accept the concept exists'. I knew I was going to stay in limbo anyway, and that the heads were wrong. The heads were in some way the beings responsible for the implementation of fate, though I knew they were just chumps for trying to control people in the physical world when they can always escape this control in their minds and dreams.Then I could feel hands on me in my dream, fully submerged in unconsciousness, and I came round to the sound of beeping, white walls and childrens drawings. There were two nurses, and I thought I was in the back room of the club. Then I realised I was in white chapel hospital with a tube stuck in my arm. I told them I wanted to leave and that I was fine and they said I had to wait for the doctor. I pulled the drip tube out of my arm and it went pop and all this blood spurted out of the hole, and I tried to get up and leave but they wouldn't give me my clothes.Then the doctor came and they put the tube back in my arm and I passed out again. I woke up at 9am and they let me go, and I was still shaking and stuff. Basically I passed out in the club at about 5am and they called an ambulance, and I didn't wake up until 9am, while the club had shut at 7am. That date didn't go too well, but pretty successful for a 4 hour full immersion k-hole! It's supposed to mix well with alcohol so I soaked about 30 grams [a little more than an ounce] in a bottle of wine [white...next time maybe red] for about a week. Based on the research that I had done I thought this would be about 1.5 'servings' so I expected very noticable effects. the wine was now quite bitter and I decided to get something to eat to mask the taste. After double-checking to make sure it wasn't a MAO inhibitor or something like that I picked cheese. The cheese was a great idea and with its help I drank about half of the bottle of wine while I watched the Tarantino episode of CSI. there was a mild 'good' sensation that seemed to come and go, but nothing too noteworthy. I didn't feel anything from the alcohol at this point so I decided to keep drinking. I strained out the flower bits and I don't know if that lessened the experience, but there's no way I could have eaten them...the wine was difficult enough to drink. by the end of 2 hours I had finished the entire bottle of wine and that was it. I felt slightly 'different' and not one tiny bit drunk...not even tipsy. I even interacted with others once I had completely finished the wine and nobody questioned my sobriety. the 'different' was more pleasant than not though and I'm definitely interested in trying again...but since the experiment cost me about $25 I don't think it will be anytime soon.  [Erowid Note: The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.] Previous experiences with coke, mdma, Ket, mushies, 5-meo-mipt, methylone, canabis, salvia, amphet, 4ho-mipt The nights menu... -roughly 40mg 4-ho-mipt (fumurate salt)-about 500mg methylone -god knows how much southern comfort - and ABSOLUTLEY NO common sense Myself (25) and girlfried (20) are lving at home at the moment with our respective parents as we're saving together for a house, dam expensive in UK. Anyways she was over at mine friday just gone, she was tierd so she bailed about 10pm. 10.45pm --I'm sat there in my room with a bottle of southern comfort (dam I love that stuff) so I start drinking away whilst tappin on the PC. Soon enough I'm fairly drunk and decide to attack the methylone. I'm looking forward to this as I love MDMA so much and I've read its similar if less intense. I put 300mg in a glass of southern comfort and ice. Straight down the hatch +20mins- I'm feeling a little better about being me, slight buzz up my spine.+30mins- I'm looking through my mp3 collection for the trance music that is so fondly my friend whilst on MDMA.+40 running my hand through my hair feels quite nice, feet a little tingly, music sounds good, listening to ibiza euphoria, I'm feeling the music.+1hr At this point I'm very much wasted on methylone. Very MDMA like but not as empathetic or body heavy in my opinion. I Decide that it would be Ok to eat a pre-weighed out 10mg gel cap of 4ho-mipt. In hind-sight this was a bad idea since I was alone.1hr 30- Right about here things become so lost I just don't know anymore. I actully eat a further 250mg of methylone in southern comfort and eat a further x3 10mg gel caps of 4ho-mipt.I daze in and out of conciousness for god knows how long but do remember 'coming round' about 4am. Visuals are so unbeleivably heavy they're unreal. Spacial distorsion to an astonishing degree, rooms are so out of persepctive I'm unsure that I'm actully in them. I decide to go into the garden for a cig. As I sit there I feel almost god like. I sit at the garden table and I'm sure there are other dark spirirts sat around the table with me and I feel like some kind of intergalatic physcadellic being. I feel like a dark being, a deeply sinister and dark being surrounded at the table by other similar beings with starnge swirling bats flying around us. Visuals are very intense.I've tripped very very hard with mushrooms but this was harder and much more intense. colours were around me but they were not happy bright colours, they were dark colours, sinister colours that weren't conductive with happyness. It was unfoundingly scary stuff that I was absolutley unprepared for and unable to deal with. However, at the time, I didnt realiase how scared I was by the shocking intensity of it all.I go back inside and try to calm down. It doesnt work. I panic. I panic a lot. Grab a coat and go into the garden again. I jump over the garden fence and start walking at a ferocious pace, I walk about 4 miles to a local farmers field with a lake in the middle of it, my only mental reasoning at the time being 'theres water there, if I can get there I'll be fine.'I get there, still very much wasted as a fart and realise that the field is not actully the sanctury that I've been looking for. Its now about 6am. I sit down and watch the sun come up over the lake which was, I admit, very beautiful and nice to watch, but short lived.I kept telling myself 'Its a drug, it'll wear off' over and over again but when I got to about 7am things werent improving, people were turning up at the lake and I was still very much out-of-control and very much panicked. I was starting to get auiable hallicinations aswell, strange noises and noises from people that werent there. By this point I'm no longer drunk or under the influenace of the methylone however cannot understand why the 4homipt still has such an unforgiving and strong grip of me. I think this lack of understanding at the time stemmed from the fact that I was so wasted when I took the 4homipt. It wasn't till the following day, when I was fully 'down' that I realised how much 4homipt I'd eaten.Meanwhile, back in the field, I was using my hand as a 'How-much-am-I-still-tripping' gauge. I'd look at it to see if it looked any less weired than it had previous, and each time it looked like some horrid twisted tree branch, like something from a tim burton film, whats more, something that didnt belong to me. Visuals at this point are very much similar to those from psicoln/pysobin. Visual perspectives are skewed, surfaces are morphing and my mind is carrying my eyes. For instance, I'm sure my hands and coat are unusualy dirty, so when I look a them I see dirt marks and on them, they look manky and horrible, later I realise theat they're clean and fine.I assess the situation. I've walked at least 4 miles at the speed of a possessed beast fleeing the scene of a crime and drunk little water. I feel dehydrated. I ponder drinking water from the lake but am sure that will arouse suspicion from surrounding dog walkers. If indeed the dog walkers are really there at all. I check my pockets. Shit me. I have my mobile phone and its charged up. FANTASTIC. I think if only I could articulate my situation to someone. I have a 'test' conversation with my self to see if I can still talk. I can't. Not without sounding like horrible and un-natural. I can't think of words to say either. I barely rememebr my name. At this point I became very alarmed and feared very slightly for my life. Looking back I fell into a deep state of panic when I jumped over the fence and fled. I should have just stopped. Thought for a second, gone back, gone bed and sweated it out. Here I am wasted to fuck on some chemical I cant even remeber the name of, dehydrated, potentialy scaring the shit out of innocent dog walkers at 7am in the morning. I phone my best friend and partner in crime, M. M doesnt answer. I call again and again and again again. I'm getting cold as well.I text him. The mobile phone is very very difficult to use. I can focus on it visually but find it hard to fathom what I meant to do in order to acheive my desired outcome. All I can muster is 'NEED HELP....HELP.' No response.I consider calling 999 and asking them to take me to hospital for some form of treatment as I seriously consider the fact that I may never be right in the head again. As I mull this thought over I shed a tear to myself becuase I'm so so scared for my sanity. I still can't understand why the drug hasn't waned at all. In fact it has waned compared to when I was sat in my garden but I'm so panicked I don't recall this at all.I check my hand, still tripping hard I think. Still looks like a wicked evil tree branch. I consider calling parents and asking them to take me to hospital. Yes I decide, thats the best bet. I call home at about 8.30am. At this point the best thing ever ever ever ever happended. My younger (20 something) brother answered! We'll call him X. RINGRING 'Hullo' 'X...errr.....is that...err...X' 'What you want?' 'Is that X' 'What you want' I was confused and didn't know what to say so I hung up, don't ask me why. I couldnt make proper words. He called me back.'I'm fucked up ner that farmer field, come for me please, bring water' The little star did just that, saved my bacon, and brought choclate. He talked me down, comforted me, walked me home, brought me water and reassured me that all would be well. I was still experiencing some degree of visual distortion till about 8pm at night. I was also running a high temperature, experiencing a stange body numbness and felt slightly disconnected from myself. I fell asleep @ 8pm than and woke 12hrs later about 8am next day.My god It felt good to be alive and Ok I'm never taking RC's on my own ever again! I don't like to type much, so I'll keep it brief. I'm 17 years old and like most 17 year olds I thought I was invinsible. I 'had' a 1996 candy apple red CAMARO w/ground effects loaded w/ power, t-tops, and 18inch lexonis-worth-$13,000. Bought by mommy & daddy. I loved this car but I drove stoned and drunk just about everyday and it was only a matter of time until something like this happened.[Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!]My friend and I were fishing in the afternoon one day and when we fish we'd get sloshed. I drank about 8 beers in 2hrs. This day we didn't shit except for a buzz. On the back to my friends brothers house being the crazy asshole he is asked me to stop at a bar-he goes in and comes out 2min later w/ a bottle of 100 proof beefeater Gin. He said he snuck it off the bar when the bartender turned around. We go to his brothers and the 3 of us finish the bottle in an hour. By now I've drank, including beer around 14-17 drinks in 4hrs-I was beligerent, couldn't talk but I could walk so I thought I could still drive - I've drove buzzed on alcohol and weed 100's of times and never was stopped by Tampa cops even in a fire red CAMARO.Against my better judgement I drove to a convenience store about 5 miles from my house. My friend was going to 'grab' a 20-pack and flex. This was not normal we needed it for a party on 4/20/02-and we were broke as a jokes with no hopes. So I parked on the side and he comes running out as planned no clerks chasing him and gets in the car. BUT there was friends of the clerk in the parking lot in a 2002 CAMRY that decided to be good samaritains. They ran up to my car and started kicking and banging on it my license plate was covered so I figured I'd blow these assholes away. Later I found out a 2002 camry has almost the horsepower as my car. I stepped on it damn near ran one of them down and I was off.For short I ran a couple red lights (stopped first) until I was on a long subdivison road I thought this is my chance I pinned the in 4th gear and was going 120mph in a 35mph zone when I came to 90 degree right turn it came up on me so fast I hardly had time to hit the brakes I slammed on the ABS system and hoped to fish tail slide the corner-the momentum was to great at some 75 mph and the car continued straight into a median and then into oncoming traffic which I thank god to this day was stopped at a red light. I plowed an innocent 41 year old woman at 50mph in the left rear quarter panel of her car. I realized I was waisted and was going to get a DUI.So with every disregard for human life possible I took off because my plate was still coveredback across the cement/grass median keep in mind my car is 3.6 inches off the ground and so is everything underneath. I was driving STRAIGHT down the road and my steering wheel was cocked 90 degrees to the right, when waisted can be confusing. The camry was still cahasing me from the beer run so I once again tried to outrun them but now it was hopeless because I couldn't steer. I still was running 105mph with all the damage. Anyway I made it to the front entrance of my subdivision where patrol was sitting w/ his lights off---I saw him from a mile away and I knew I was fucked.He pulled me over and arrested me and my friend for petty theft, poss. of marijuana, poss. of alcohol, leaving scene of accident, careless driving, refusal to subit to a breath test, poss. of a pipe, I'm luck I didn't get reckless endangerment. Before this happened I had never had a ticket a never really went more than 10mph over the limit. I thank god everyday that I didn't hurt or kill anybody because I could'nt live w/ myself. This story how alcohol when takin in large amounts clouds judgement beyond reason and logical thinking. So monitor your buzz. When I didn't, shit I never thought I'd do, I did.I hope this story will serve as a reminder that drinking and driving is one of the most selfish things you can do. As of now no license for 1 year, 500 hours community service, 3 years probation W/ piss tests. I got off easy because I had no prior record - they said if I would of injured someone I'd be doing hard time. Oh yeah not one company in florida will insure me. I'm gonna walk to the store now, remember what I said it might save your life. I purchased 200g of Blue lotus from an online vendor. I was quite excited to try this new substance. I had tried many substances that I believed would be similar to it, marijuana, salvia, wild dagga ect but all of these are quite different to lotus in actuality.I had just finished my exams and I tried to stay clean while taking them (for obvious reasons) so on the day I finished I was determined to get really high and clear out some of the information that would not be necessary ever again.At around 7.50 I took out some of the petals that I had grinded earlier that week, it totaled around 20-30g by my guess. This is considerably more than any report I have read before so I believed this would be good. After 40 mins I came back to the percolator which held the 20-30gs of blue lotus and two mugs of water in it. I poured this brown liquid into a big bottle, I tasted the brew, it was sour and tasted reminiscent of what I believe a bark and dirt mixture would be. I added 5gs of sugar to this and it quickly became a pleasant drink, one which I could drink easily within three minutes. Fifteen minutes past and although in the back of my mind there was the feeling that there were some effects starting it was incredibly subtle and I wasn´t sure whether the petals were even real or not.I sat down on the sofa and watched some television. After another ten minutes I could really feel some effects, I was watching a cartoon and it seemed to be traveling at a strange speed, way too fast, pictures flashing in front of me becoming more vivid and drawing me into the set. This was a hypnotic and pleasant feeling, quite disorientating though.I ran up to my room and grabbed a beer, I heard that drinking and lotus synergized well so I gave it a go. After the tea I found the beer easily downable, it tasted quite diluted and I finished within a minute. I returned to the TV set and continued watching sitcoms and cartoons. A hypnotic and sedated feeling spread across my body and this lasted another 15 minutes or so. Then the synergy of the alcohol began to be noticeable, there was a lucidity and an amplification of the hypnotic feeling in my body.The strange part of the experience was the fact that my mind was sedated yet strangely aware and capable of mental processes. My body however was still working perfectly, I could stand and walk straight though while walking any lights did seem to leave trails as I moved my head. I felt a bit off balance but not really dizzy.I went to my room again and since I wanted to keep the feeling going I grabbed my bong, did about 8 hits getting through about four grams of lotus, I had tried smoking lotus on its own before but without drinking some lotus tea it does nothing.After smoking the lotus the experience changed again. Now I did feel quite strong euphoric feelings and great feelings of wellbeing. I was sedated and calm, with slight euphoria. It wasn´t like MDMA euphoria, it was less naive and potent than that, it was the inner peaceful kind, a wise kind of fulfilled euphoria. Not a heavy drug that gets me stoned out of my mind inexplicably, a subtle yet complex, enlightening and fun trip.It was a very cerebral high and any buzz in my head was definitely radiating from the top of my head. My eyelids felt heavy and I did begin to feel tired, very tired.A great and ever changing, metamorphic high that is only held back by the fact that its effects do not last very long, by 11.00 I was baseline again.P.S.     I almost vomited when I tried to eat the pulp from the percolator after drinking the beer. It was extremely distasteful and had a nasty texture. My first encounter with drunkenness was a little over seven months ago. Before then I had tried various alcoholic beverages but, due to lack in supply and no particular interest in doing so, I never got drunk. That had changed one night, however, when I was at a friends house. We decided, since I was moving away, that we should have some fun while I was still around (we did pick an awful time to do due to the fact that I was supposed to leave that night).Anyway, we went downstairs to her parent liquor cabinet and took an unopened bottle of Absolut vodka. When we got back upstairs we mixed up half a glass of vodka with half a glass of orange juice. I remember the taste being a bit strong but I had no problem drinking it. After we drank out first glass we each had another. And then, shot after shot after shot. I don't remember exactly how many. I do, however, remember that as time went by the strong alcohol taste became dulled. I believe that we drank between half and three quarters of the bottle.    So afterward I just lay on the floor, feeling like a heap of something, holding a shot glass (I had to sip it now because the taste had become too strong now) and watching Invader Zim. I distinctly remember that the main thought I had at the time was how much my head hurt. Like a constant headache. I also remember wanting to have sex. Then, her mom called us down for dinner. We had some kind of sausage but I couldn't eat it. I felt like I was going to throw up. Her mom was talking to me and I was talking back. It was as if I was locked inside my head lookin’ through crystallized glass and my body had taken over functioning for me so that I would look normal. I don't remember a word that she or I had said. Later, they had to take me home. Both of us were still considerably drunk. We got into the car and right after we pulled out of the drive way she vomited all over herself. Her dad dropped her back at the house. I got into the front seat and settled myself in a familiar heap. Once again there was a conversation that I was no part of. Soon after I vomited al over myself as well. I spent the rest of the night kneeling by their toilet. She had passed out on her bed.     Obviously, this wasn’t a very good experience for me. I would also like to say that up until now I haven’t been able to drink alcohol because the taste seemed stronger to me than it did then. When ever I try to drink I cant stand the taste. This can be easily remedied though by gradually increasing the amount of alcohol in juice or soda. At the time, I was 14 years old (at this time of writing, I'm 19).  There's certainly no way in hell I could tell you the exact dose, because it was quite a lot, and back then I didn't even understand what a 'shot' was (although I sure enjoyed them, that's for sure).Perhaps an important thing to note would be a personal description of what I was like at the time for my fellow scholars.  I was a high school freshman for like, less than a month.  Back then I was a skinny guy, and quite a shy one at that (I graduated high school as one of the most prominent nerds and reserved people of my graduating class, although somewhat wrongfully because I changed quite a lot throughout high school).  I did not talk very much back then, and I was actually more outgoing in front of my friends than my family.  I still am to a certain degree.I was going to go to my sister's house and pop my cherry with booze, although I don't think I quite understood that at the time (hard to believe I guess).  When I got there, she gave me a Bud Light, and I immediately sat down.  I'd tasted beer before, and thought it was weird, and at this time, I still thought it was a little weird because I'd never quite had a grasp of what alcohol tasted like.  I enjoyed it in that regard, although the taste itself wasn't an immense pleasure for me.  I didn't hate it though, so I choked it down as best I could.  I didn't want to be a wuss or anything, so I didn't take my time.  I'd say it took me about 4 minutes to finish it off.  Her boyfriend was there, along with a couple other interesting characters I just met.  It was a pretty awesome party.  We also played an addictive game of dice called 'ten thousand'.  I don't remember the rules but it's also possible to play by yourself.I remember the whole experience quite perfectly (which is just awesome!). Right after this, I asked my sister, 'What else ya got?'  I guess I already started to become less inhibited.  I felt the buzz right away, although I'd call it more of a 'shock' to the body from finishing a beer off for the first time.  And it made perfect sense to me after everything I'd heard all my life about alcohol, and seeing people drunk.  I immediately became curious, the shy, skinny, INHIBITIED guy that I was, of what alcohol was all about.  I think my sister wanted to put me to the test or something, judging from what the next challenge was.Goldschlager!  She poured into the tiny glass we all have come to know and love as a 'shotglass' (yes, this is the first time I actually knew what it was, hey, I was new, sue me).  I was instructed to 'drink it quickly and not like the beer I just had'.Now that I'm a hell of a lot more experienced, I'm surprised at how well I took my first shot, especially since it was close to 90 proof cinnamon-flavored schnapps.  This has become a drink of sentiment for me - good taste, amazing drunken, happy experiences, and best of all, it introduced me to the world of alcohol.  I have no idea how much more I had, because first of all, I didn't even know at the time that it was roughly the equivalent to an entire beer, so I didn't even know at the time how I would keep track of my drinks.  I'd say I had about 10+ drinks total?  It could've been up to 15 or so.  I don't know exactly, but I would swear that it took me a good number of experiences to be able to handle that much alcohol again.  I also had some vodka, tequila, Coors, and various things like that, but the Goldschlager is definitely what got me under the table (I definitely was taking it to town on the experimentation).  I heard that on your first time, your body rejects it as a poison or something.  I don't know...I fell in love with the experience.  All those inhibitions I had back then were temporarily unheard of.  I was laughing non-stop, and I've never been able to laugh as easily as I'd like to.  I was sitting most of the time for sure.  I was talking quite a lot and not making a great deal of sense, but everyone did their best to listen.  I wasn't reserved, and I loved it!  I was the life of the party.Near the end of the night, for about the last two hours of the drunk, I was VERY tired.  That also probably contributed to how fucked up I was.  It was a Friday, so I'd obviously been up that day since 6 in the morning.  I don't think I've ever even since gotten up that early and then gotten drunk, now that I think about it.  And it's been five years!  I also don't think I've ever fallen asleep so easily in my life.What a really strange way to foretell an inevitable future...I hate to say it, but getting drunk was very enlightening.  It made it very clear to me that I was sooner or later going to become more social, less reserved, etc.  An odd twist of fate took place and my sister moved away shortly after, although I did get drunk a couple more times at her house before that happened.  My sister was gone for a long time, and for reasons I'd rather not get into here, almost completely out of contact with us until I was a SENIOR in high school, and by then, she'd moved back in with my Mom an I.  So basically, throughout all of high school, I got drunk three times in my freshman year and the next time I got drunk after that was when I GRADUATED high school in celebration!  Oh yeah, my sister was also there, since the family was basically reunited with her again.  I thought that was almost a poetic fit.I've been in college now, so I'll leave the rest of the history to your imagination.  Goldschlager has become one of my all-time favorite things to drink, and of all possible things I enjoy the most, whiskey (Canadian Mist is especially amazing) is my favorite.  For a while I had difficulty enjoying beer, but I love it again (strange).I don't write much anymore, so I apologize for my excessive use of parenthesis and tendency to say things in long sentences.  I hope anyone reading this enjoyed it! I'm male, 40 years old, 1.70 meter tall, regular MJ smoker for over 20 years, former heavy cigarettes smoker. In good health.size of a bottle : 0.66 liter. alcohol content : around 5 % vol (estimated).I grew hops in my garden. Every autumn, I'm brewing beer from the female flowers. This year, I brewed a little amount of beer adding some fresh wormwood to the mix. I have reduced the amount of hops by half. I never weigh amounts. The volume of fresh wormwood was something like 1/2 of the hops, boiled for 1 hour. I tried drinking it last night for the first time, 5 weeks after having started the process. The beer was a bit more bitter than regular one, with a wormwood taste. I like bitter tastes very much, but it was the max I could drink with some pleasure. After having drunk 1/3 of the bottle, the wormwood taste seemed to be weaker. I drank the bottle in 3H approx. I had smoked a MJ joint when starting to drink. There was a specific effect which wasnt from alcohol, hops or pot. I was much more awake that I would have been with just the pot and a regular beer in the same time. I was more 'high' than 'stoned'. Visual perception was a little bit more 'tridimensional', things had more relief, just like in a very mild Salvia trip. All this was light but I'm sure it wasn't placebo. The effect peaked when I had drunk 2/3 of the bottle, approx. 1 H 30 after the start. The high lasted for 1 H and wore off very quickly. 3 Hours after the start, I smoked MJ again. This time I was half asleep and very relaxed.  In the late evening, and today's morning, my intestines were a little bit irritated. It's the only side effect I had noticed. I got 5 more bottles of my wormwood beer... Next time, I'll try with a lower amount of wormwood in the brew. The taste is interesting, but once should be light-handed when adding wormwood in order to get something drinkable. I plan to try the 'thujone extract experiment' and I'm wondering if the thujone which seems to be also present in Salvia officinalis could work too... I dont plan to distillate absinthe. I've decided to wait until I was back to baseline to right this report so I can be as accurate as possible in it's description.  First a little about me.  I'm 20 years old and I'm a regular weed smoker and I also enjoy other drugs as well, to an extent.  My father recently had surgery and was given a large prescription for Oxycodone, of which he gave me 3.  That is basically how this idea came about.I was sitting in my room one night with a friend and we were listening to music.  I am an avid audiophile with a very expensive stereo capable of all formats including SACD, DVD-Audio/Video and all the standards like vinyl and CD.  We decided that we should get stoned and listen to Pink Floyd's Dark side of the Moon on SACD (Which is in 5.1 Totally Amazing).  She had brought a bottle of Bacardi 151 along that night as well which we had been 'sipping'.I remembered then that I had those 3 pills that my dad had given to me.  I told my freind and she agreed that it would be a cool thing to try.  We proceeded to smoke and vaporize about 3 grams of some pretty good pot that I had procured.  Directly after we had finished that (about an hour later) I proceeded to take the 3 pills with a shot of 151 for a drink. All in all that was pretty nasty considering I bit one of the pils by accident and it was nasty.This is when the night started to get really good.  About 20 minutes after taking the pills I began to feel very relaxed.  I was quite stoned at this point having smoked a good amount in one sitting for 2 poeple.  To me the Oxycodone seemed to greatly intensify the high from the pot.  Overwhelming feelings of melting into the chair and comlete satisfaction were all around.I found myself not wanting to do any more drugs.  I was completely satisfied.  By this point, about 3 hours after the first shot and an hour after smoking, I was on cloud nine.  I sat in a darkenend room listening to all kinds of music and really enjoying it.  My friend was also feeling very good as well and we enjoyed the night for what seemed like 5 hours, but it was only about 3.My advice on this combo is get some good music and a damn good chair.  This is now one of my favorite combo's ever (Even more so than Acid and Ecstacy).  It is completely euphoric, relaxing, and satisfying.  I recomend only doing this about once a week if you can obtain the Oxycodone easily as it is addictive.  I, however have not noticed any physical addiction over a several month period of once a week usage, and about the same dose as listed above.  Go on and try it and tell me what you think.Izlsnizzt Though this may sound like a rediculous and iresponsible combination of substances, it was over a period of 12 hours and at a student party with friends and strangers and I have regretted it since.18:00 - Arrived at the house and rolled a (moderately sized) joint to be smoke communally between my friends and I.The high feeling that comes from this set in shortly after/during and I was still able to legibly converse with my companions.  My mood was elevated.19:00(ish) - Another Joint.The high feeling that had been had sunken into the distance and we decided to have a topup.The evening went on with one or two more, and I began drinking at around 21:00 as the music was on and people were arriving.22:00 - I began feeling very lethargic and decided that a few lines of coke would pick me up, and it did seem to counteract the down pull of the cannabis.I finished the bottle of cider and continued drinking as the night went on, and aquired a bag of base (speed? was what he refered to it as) from somone we knew.  I couldnt really taste it but remember the feeling of dabbing and swallowing it being very close to that of a very fine dust, like chalk.1:00(ish) - I could feel a very big buzz from the base and alcohol, and decided it was time to drop the first of my two pills to wake me up a bit.  I felt the familiar rush from the drug and it was disorienting but pleasant, empathising with the fast electronic music at the party and feeling a need to dance.7:00(ish) - The music was still on but the party was coming to an end, I had consumed the second of my pills at some point but there are big blank patches in my memory.  Music still felt like it was everything to me, and talking to people took on a very meaningful tone though I am not sure i could really understand alot of what was going on around me.  Sleep was the furthest thing from my mind, dispite the time.8:30 - we had aided in the evacuation of most attendees of the party and i noted having trouble with keeping still and the alcohol had mostly worn off, leaving no noticable residue of after-effects yet.  As the sun was up i noticed my vision wasnt right, i couldnt make out lighting properly as everything seemed to be too vibrant and with a darker colour than normal.  Around this time we relaxed to talk about the night and had a few more joints.  I Halucinated mildly, seeing patterns and movement (pulsating?) textures on my skin and peoples faces but i was comfortable with it and i laughed about it with people.I couldnt sleep dispite how physically tired i began feeling, the overexertion from the pills being more pronounced in my legs than anywhere else.  The lapses in my memory were making me paranoid and worried about my actions in that intoxicated state, and even after I had slept I was very irritable with a very strong comedown that lasted around two days.  My appetite had completely gone and i didnt eat the following day.Overall i had a good experience but the come down was so incredibly soul destroying I will not be doing it again, though it did give me time to think of how much damage i could be doing to myself (and more specifically, my mind) and i haven't felt the need to touch the latter three substances since.For those looking for substances to aid the party atmosphere or to highten awareness, I hope you have found this useful though I would not reccomend mixing drugs unless you really know what you are taking and have good company to watch over you.  Individually, I have found these substances to be very effective and pleasant around large groups of people and music, making the social experience very rewarding. On a recent Friday night I went party hopping in the apartments surrounding my university, and I consumed a moderately large amount of alcohol for a person of my size and tolerance. As a list of what I had: one shot of spiced rum, two shots of vodka, 1.5 to 2 shots of Bicardi 151 rum, and 1.5 to 2 shots of gin. I have had more alcohol than this before and been completely conscious, having an enjoyable drunk experience.However, there was a party at an apartment nearby, which we accessed by going down a set of stone stairs. These stairs, I recall, were very fun to race down crazily and drunkenly, and I had little problem accomplishing this, up until one point, when I lost memory. That point was when I apparently slipped and banged the back of my head hard against the stair. The memory loss was caused by this trauma, clearly. After hitting my head, my friend tells me that I claimed to be okay, but wanted to simply rest or sleep. Bad idea. I sat down and apparently dozed off, despite my friends' attempts to keep me up. I got up, but then lost the ability to continue standing. An old roommate and friend of mine had to hold me up. At one point my friends walked me home to my apartment and stayed with me until I freaked them out so much they called campus security. I believe what scared them was my amnesia and delirium--I was speaking nonsense and could not answer simple factual questions (How old are you, what day is it?). Campus security called the paramedics, who continued the interrogation and decided to take me to the hospital, where I clearly needed to go.I have no way of knowing what happened over the next four hours. I assume the doctors did the usual tests for a drunken college student, plus CT scans and other examinations of my head. I eventually woke at the hospital and apparently called home. I have a message on my answering machine from myself. I don't remember making this call. From listening to this message, I could tell that I was still very much out of it and needed to rest until I cleared up. But that didn't happen, as I somehow walked out of the hospital (the simplest answer is that I escaped, as the hospital was a busy downtown hospital). As I left the hospital, I regained the ability to form memories, so I can recall the rest of the story from this point on.I walked two or three blocks from the hospital and up to a parking  lot and some construction workers doing work on a street outside of an apartment complex. I hassled these guys, as I had absolutely no idea where I was, why I was there, what day it was, etc. I actually believed that I was experiencing a dream and that 'dream logic' could be applied. I remember entering a car at one point, thinking I could drive it home or at least scare the nearby assholes enough to help me somehow. I gave one guy my friend's cell phone number, and he eventually called it, but by then the police had come and arrested me for public drunkenness.I fought those cops verbally, and begged for them to take me home. Instead they took me to a station and breathalyzed me, and I got .11. It was 8 am, so the cops thought I got really trashed the night before and that all my behavior was from alcohol, when it must have been more to do with the fact that I probably had a concussion only 5 hours earlier.The cops threw me in a cell for 4 hours, which is standard for drunks they won't prosecute. I called everyone, my parents, my roommate, myself, and eventually my grandfather came and drove me home. Being in jail was terrible, it was 4 hours of remorse. I had absolutely no idea what had happened to me the night before, so I was scared out of my mind and just needed to be at home.When I got home, my roommates told me what happened, though I am always hearing new details. I apparently shit in my pants and vomited all over, which means I probably had a concussion. I’m a 23-year-old student from Ireland, I lived in London for a year. During this time I partied like a rock star, going to some of the world’s best clubs every other week to see the world’s finest techno deejays do their thing. I had many a mad night out, the drugs were cheaper and of far higher quality than back home. All you could get where I lived was hash and XTC, perhaps a bit of speed. In London anything was available! The English love their weed, the green you could buy on the street kicked the shit of the dry, weak as fuck gear I tried back home. The pills were always as good as the best I ever got in Ireland, often better. They were five for £20 in the clubs, ten for £10 if you knew a dealer. It was paradise.Before I moved back to this hell hole of a country in June 2004, I invited me old sparring partner Dee over for a mad weekend. I’ve been best mates with Dee for years, we always went on mad trips out to dance festivals raves, nightclubs, etc. and we had some pretty fucked up times. We are both into techno, both have turntables, and both have an unhealthy appetite for all things naughty. Where as Dee is a major coke and E head (his personal best is 4g coke, 23 pills and a 700ml bottle of vodka in 24 hours) I’m more than happy with a couple of pills and shit loads of smoke.Dee lived in Barcelona for 6 months while I was in London. I visited him for a week in November, when it was pissing rain, cold, and fuck all tourists about, therefore fuck all people spoke English. We were reduced to buying 10 Euro deals of hash of 14-year-old Romanian Gypsies drug dealers on the street. 10 Euros got you enough for one of our large sized spliffs, a lump about the size of a peanut M+M. I was pissed off to say the least cause I had a lump of hash the size of a Mars bar on my bedside table back in London. At least we got some good pills in a club one night, as its impossible to get any pills in Barcelona at all.I invited him over to London on the second weekend of May, and planned a good old time for us both. I ordered in half an ounce (14g) of hash and a quarter (7g) of some mind-melting weed of my supplier. He was a middle aged mellow stoner who had been dealing drugs all his life, and he always gave me monster deals at a fair price. I also decided to try something new to both of us for the weekend, MUSHROOMS!! I was walking past a record shop on the way home from work when I spotted a sign in the window advertising shrooms for £5 an ounce. You see in the UK the mushrooms themselves aren’t illegal, but the psychoactive juice inside them is a class A drug. This is to protect some poor cunt who has them growing naturally in his garden, so leaving a loophole you could drive a bus through in the law. Sweet, no?They also down graded cannabis to a class C drug when I moved over there, meaning in your own home or garden you and your mates could smoke all day long and the filth could do fuck all about it. If you are caught smoking on the street, they ask you to go down an alley to finish it (happened to me twice), or at worse take it off you and give you a lecture. The only way you can be arrested with it is if you blaze up near a school or playground. Drinking on the street, on the bus and on the train is cool too, that’s why I love that country so much.The week before he arrived I had the house to myself so I bought a half ounce of Thai shrooms and ate them on the train home from work. They tasted like nothing I ever had before, and had to stop myself from puking it all back up with every mouthful. Showered when I got home and had a spliff of the weed I got early on in the week, to test it out. The buzz crept up slowly, my stomach felt warm and fuzzy, kinda like when your ‘coming up’ on an E tablet but far less intense. I noticed all vertical lines, like the houses on the street behind the mine, were ever so gently rocking forward and backward, while the horizontal lines of the roofs and the ground were also moving. I looked at the tree in the garden, it seemed to be folding itself in and out like a fucked up origami cutout. I was so cool looking I nearly forgot to finish ma spliff!I retired inside to watch ‘The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly’ on DVD. The buzz was really beginning to kick in by now, and the scene at the start where the three men walk slowly towards each other then rush into the bar was the most alien thing I ever saw!I couldn’t make head nor tale of what I was seeing at all, though I was loving every minute of it and laughing my ass of to my self. In fact I kept turning to my left to comment on it to the thin air on the sofa beside me. I rang Dee and let him know what he was in for next weekend, though I didn’t make much sense to him!Anyway, he arrived Friday, we went record shopping, bought an ounce of shrooms each and headed home. We had a good few spliffs and a few cans of beer in the back garden, watching the sun go down and catching up on the news and craic from back home. We went to the pub for a few, but as I had been working a 7-day, 65-hour week on a fucking building site for a few months previously (I’m serious, apart from that weekend I had like five days off in four months) we had an early night.I will try to describe the Saturday on some sort of time scale for you to see how the drugs gradually took hold, but the concept of time fly’s out the fucking window when you are off your face!! Let me just say it was one of the 2 most fucked up drug guzzling weekends we were ever on so keep reading, the good bit starts here...10am: We start the day with a hearty breakfast of beer and spliffs with weed and hash lovingly packed into five papers. The sun was out in a cloudless sky, it was already 23 C, and would reach about 29 or 30 degrees by midday. We donned the sunglasses and headed down to the cafe for a fried breakfast of bacon, eggs and chips. This was all we would eat all day, tee hee. I lived about 15 miles from the city centre so we hopped on the underground and headed uptown to Vauxhall.12am: Vauxhall tube is right behind MI6 head quarters, the cool as fuck building seen at the start of the James Bond film where he chases the lady in the jet boat. After giving a good Irish one fingered fuck you to the security cameras, whilst skinning up, we head to the little park behind it to eat the shrooms, washed down with a frosty can of beer. They still tasted like shit but I knew what was coming next so we ate the most of the and hid the rest (about 1/4 ounce) under a bush. We then went into the Queen Anne pub on the edge of the park. The Queen Anne is London's sleaziest, most down and out strip club. There’s a bar, a small stage with three poles and a whole host of drunks, weirdos and perverts inside. The windows are boarded up and after each dance the girls come round with a Hamlet cigar tin for their cash, £1 per person.We settle in with another pint and sit right at the front. We are the only patrons under 40 in the whole place, the rest are deathly still and look like they are on trial for murder, their faces a mixture of guilt and awe. The women are ok, one sweet little Brazilian who looks like that Eva what’s her face off Desperate House Wives’, few English, one black hoochie mama who weighs more than Dee and I put together. When the music starts (Fuck you right back, Hot in Here, etc.) they strip, go on the poles, kneel in front of you and finger their pussies, etc. Good wholesome fun.1:30pm: We start coming up ever so slightly on the shrooms, Dee says its kinda like comin’ up on a yoke (XTC) .I agree, not wanting to spoil what’s coming next for him. We can’t stop laughing at nothing, the girls sense we are up to something as we are talking gibberish to each other when there is a choice bare ass inches from our noses. More beer please bar man!2:30pm: We are fucked with a capital F by this stage, the serial killer looking regulars are looking daggers at us for spoiling their dirty fuck fantasies. Am having little visions of me sitting on the stool and everything takes on a brown/yellow tint. The lights kinda leave a trail behind them when I turn my head, far out. The women ‘dancing’ must have enjoyed seeing two fucked up young bloods in instead of the usual knob ends, and tease us more to fuck with our messed heads. The black lady’s clit looks like a limp brown match stick attached to her cunt lips. The conversation is going down hill rapidly, kinda like when your coming down off yokes and you keep forgetting what you said, or even what the fuck you were talking about in the first place. We had seen every girl dance twice by this stage, so we throw £1 each into the next girls tin and make good our escape outside into the world.4 pm: We head over to the petrol station opposite MI6 to get some cans of beer, and admire the building for a while. It seemed to stretch up to the sky, the sides nodding this way and that. We are still buzzing, and seek out the last of our shrooms under the bush. The sun had sweated them a bit, so I licked the inside of the bag after sharing them with Dee. The park was fairly empty, some people sunbathing, walking their dogs, larking about. We sat down on the grey dying grass and made a monster spliff each to cement our friendship. I never felt as close to Dee as then. On pills we were always in a sweaty loud nightclub, in worlds of our own. Here we could talk and drink and smoke, only the noise of aircraft overhead disrupting the moment. We discussed where next. I suggested Soho, the red-light/sex shop area just north of the West End. Dee was thinking about the whores, I could tell, but then he remembered a certain football match was taking place...Of course! Arsenal, his favourite team, was playing the last game of the Premiership Football league. The team had the title in the bag months before, today was their crowning glory. They had been unbeaten all season. Their home ground, where the match was, was a half hour away by train. Why not? The silly cunt had spent the last 10 years or so screaming at them on the TV every match they played. Dee was a die hard supporter, he was kicked out of our local back home for fighting with another silly cunt who teased him when they lost an unimportant game. Away we went to the train station, Dee grinning ear to ear. We got a few cans of beer for the journey and another spliff for good luck.5pm: Of all the fucking luck, when we plonked down on our seats we were faced with two old aged pensioners, two typical grandmas with their little shopping bags and their little umbrellas, on a day like this?! I think we scared the shit out of them, cause if I looked half as bad as Dee, we looked like two crack heads on the way back from a five-day binge. Grinning manically, eyes like car tyres, laughing at the sound of the doors closing, etc. We were trying to drink the beer but kinda kept missing the mouth! They were clutching their bags closer to their bodies with each stop we passed, as we had started making growling noises and jerking our bodies just to freak them out. The visuals started kicking in again, the sun must have worked wonders on the remaining shrooms! Will this journey ever end? Who gives a fuck, I could sit here all day buzzing with ma buddy.After 5pm: Finally fucking got to Islington, where Highbury Stadium is located. Every pub was overflowing with pissed up cunts in Arsenal shirts and hats. We skinned up another joint on a wall under a tree, a police helicopter clattering over head. The sounds, the smell of car exhaust, the taste of cold beer, friendship, rushes. After the weirdness of the train journey it was good to be back in the warm sun. I realised how open to suggestion shrooms leave you, the train journey felt like a tape stuck between fast forward and reverse. The dark image rushing past the windows, the constant noise, the same faces, it seemed like time had stopped, like we were on a different planet. Now we remembered it was the middle of the day, a warm summers day. Sweet!Me and Dee were buzzing like fuck off each other. We gave each other a big manly hug and he thanked me from the bottom of his heart for having him over. I felt like we were 15 all over again, sneaking a few tins of cider behind some bushes before going into an under age disco. Nothing mattered but us, the world was built around us and we were masters of our own destinies. We were invincible, like an IRA hit squad at the heart of the enemy, except our brief was to run riot and have fun, not fuck people up.A disposable camera is purchased and we trek up to the stadium. We ask directions of a family, who were delighted to help out two pissed up Paddies. If we had our glasses off they would have shoved their kids down the road and pretended we weren’t there. Cunts. We purchase another two beers (every corner shop sells beer, unlike Ireland, so we bought them one at a time to have a cold one in hand at all times) and stop for a smoke break. We have fuck all weed left so we dig into the hash instead. The park is next to the main road from the stadium, its a sea of red and white, Dee nearly cums in his pants at the site. He decides there and then he wants to move over here for good (he does 6 months later). Yeah yeah, whatever!After fucking about the stadium for a while (I’m not into football, and the match ended hours ago) I request him to stop arseing about and lets get some more drugs up town. Although I’m high on about three different drugs, I’m in complete control and can remember these events like yesterday. The train journeys a bit fuzzy, but soon were in Soho. I can feel the shrooms starting to leave my head, maybe the few I took the last day gave me a tolerance to them?7pm: The day begins to cool a bit so we head into a cosy pub for some light refreshment. After a day of drinking cheap Red Stripe beer, the proper pint of Stella is like gold going down. We are no longer rushing on shrooms, although we feel in great form, deciding what to do next. I’m surprised how sober we are, considering we have drank over a gallon of beer each during the day, plus everything else. We decide to wander deeper into Soho, dodging the queens ready to leer and drool over two luscious young home boys like ourselves. Sorry mate, exit only! We walk down Great Windmill Street, covered in strip joints, sex shops and whorehouses. A word of warning to tourists, especially Yank tourists, DO NOT GO NEAR THESE PLACES!! If your looking for action, ring a massage parlour. The knocking shops are run by VERY scary people, they tempt you in, tease you, then two seven-foot apes rush in and take your cash before fucking you out face first onto the piss soaked streets outside. If you have little cash you will be frog marched to the nearest ATM, made to key in your pin, and they take all that instead. The very day before Dee came over, a crime phone in show reconstructed an incident that happened outside the Blue Bunny Club on this very street. Typical story, they ripped the guy off, slapped him about, kicked him out and had a good laugh at the poor cunt. He ran off seething. The girls sit on stools outside these fine establishments enticing people in. Fifteen minutes after being kicked out, the guy came back with a bowie knife and stabbed the poor girl sitting on it to death. You have been warned...8pm: So there we were, swaggering down the street like we had the biggest balls in the world. As we came level with the Blue Bunny, I noticed Dee had a filthy little smile on his face. There was a very sexy black girl on the stool, shouting 'Come on baby!' to us. I pushed him on double quick, not arsed to explain why. We stopped in a sex shop and bought a bottle of poppers (amyl nitrate) to lift our spirits. The club we were going to didn’t open for another three hours so we found this beautiful little square, open space with trees around. There was a guy practicing the circus trick where he has a string between two sticks, and two plastic cones joined at the pointy bits. He would flick it up in the air and catch it between the sticks on the string. We sat down and lashed into the weed and hash. As you have probably guessed, we love our smoke, there’s fuck all worth doing back home but get high.The guy was pretty shit at the tricks but we rested our asses and relaxed. After being on the move constantly since we left the Queen Anne, I only then realised the shrooms were still effecting my vision and mood. Central London is a beautiful city to look at, all the fine buildings, the little trees and shrubs, the people walking about. The guy came and chatted with us for a few minutes, as we were the only people cheering him on. We gave him some of the spliffs and he warned us to watch out for the filth, as they loved giving youths a hard time in this fancy area. Alas the thirst soon kicked back in and we headed off for more nasty cheap booze.9pm: We stumble across a shop that sells 40 ounce bottles of San Miguel beer. Oh happy dayz! When Dee lived in Barcelona, all he drank was these very same bottles of beer. Over there they were 1 Euro each, about 60p in real money. Here they were £3 Dacha well... To make matters worse, after a large hit from the bottle of poppers I dropped mine like a spastic cunt, nearly cutting the fuck off some poor girls feet. I retreated back into the shop before her boyfriend started on me. Soon after we settled in a door way opposite a strip club. We really started into the gear big time, its a fine tradition of ours to get as fucked up as possible before even thinking of entering a club. We skinned up the last of the weed, smoked it, and took turns taking 20 second hits from the poppers. Things were going downhill fast! The bouncers opposite us were pissing themselves laughing at the two Paddy winos sitting in the gutter getting fucked up. Again I dropped my 40 ounce, but it was near empty anyhow. I still did a little war dance though, the bouncers loved the free entertainment! We were slowly getting pissed, smoking spliff after spliff after spliff didn’t help either. Time to move on, the night had just began.11pm: After a short train ride to Farringdon, we arrived, Fabric. The finest techno club London had to offer. We were to meet my sister and a buddy of ours there. We were in no mood to stand about so we ducked straight inside. Fabric is an old train station converted into a nightclub. All red brick and steel tubing. It has unisex toilets too, although the men only have a piss trough while the ladies have toilets. What if you have to shit? The main room plays boring as fuck minimal techno, where the introduction of a high hat is the highlight of a tune. The back room is a small sweaty room with a deafening sound system and an ace laser show. We were just sipping beers and taking poppers, as my mate was bringing the yokes. You are allowed to smoke gear in it too but the old coordination was to far gone by this stage!12am: About fucking time! Derrick arrives with my big sis, and the beans. Five for £20? Safe mate, fucking safe as fuck! I was beginning to slow down at this stage, the beer always catches up with you. The shrooms were long gone and some arse hole knocked the poppers out of my hand. Down the hatch. Usually the back room is ROCKING, Rob Hood, Sven Vath , Dave Clarke, DJ Rush, etc. but tonight we have Miss Kitten. She’s good but I would consider her a warm up act. The pills in England are always kick ass, the Irish ones are dish water in comparison, not even half the strength. I cant really get into the music that she’s playing, Dee and the rest of them are about somewhere, I always go off on my own when I’m in a club, better fun. After the initial rush of the first three yokes I sit down for a while as my back hurts. This some times happens to me from standing up all day, plus I’m rapidly losing interest in the music. I skin up a spliff with a pair of girls, I don’t try to chat them up as it seems like too much effort.7am: The club is about to close so we jump in a taxi to go home. We could take the tube for a fraction of the cost, but we would have to concentrate on when to get on/off trains, wait for connecting trains, etc. The taxi driver puts on some soothing music and we are away. I feel wired from the pills, but in a good mood. Dee and I are going to be talking about this day when we are in our 70’s, soon we will be home, safe, sleep. We stop at my old address, where Derrick still lives, about seven miles from the river. I hate it when you are coming home wired in the morning and every one is going about their Sunday morning business. In the flat Derrick makes coffee for my sister, Dee and I make a rather large spliff. Derrick and my sister are as good a friends as me and Dee are, go way back. They were doing what we were doing and then some when they were in there teens, respect!Fucking hate rolling spliffs after a night out, your mouth is as dry as sandpaper and your vision is all over the place. Has to be done, love me smoke after a few yokes. My sis is staying the night (day rather?) here so Dee and I make the last leg home on our own. Dee finds a pill in his pocket and I guilt trip him into giving me half. Works every time! We could take the tube then a bus, but we can also take a bus straight to my front door. The first way we will be home a massive 10 minutes earlier, fuck that, think as little as possible, take the bus young man. It had been an evening of some energy expenditure, I couldn’t cope with more hard work like changing from bus to train. We wait for the bus in silence, the goldfish memory had kicked in, we both knew there was no point trying. The people at the bus stop tutted and stared. If I could have been bothered I would have given them something to stare at, namely me pissing against the bus stop or something like that. Need. Sleep. Bed. Home.8am: On the 45-minute bus ride home we didn’t speak one work to each other. Too fucked. The grandma’s going to church were disgusted two nice young men like us had let ourselves get into such a state. We’re only freaks on the weekend love, only on the weekend.Finally get home, I take the very, very last bit of weed I had been stashing for myself and make a nightcap spliff out of it and some hash, while Dee organizes the beer. Again we sit in near silence doing drugs. Doing drugs. Sounds so alien to me. Alas we are empty shells of men, zombies, prolonging a high that died hours ago.I realise we have been on the go for 23 hours straight, the suns up, the party has to end. Sleep is all we want now. We still have a nice nub of hash left, over an eighth. We shake hands and hug half heartedly, then off to bed. I was asleep before I hit the pillow…I slept for 11 hours straight, nobody could wake me up. I was pissed off cause I had promised Dee to take him to a cool outdoor pub were all the fuck ups go after a night out to carry on with the party. He and my bro and sis had a barbeque instead. I got up at 9pm that night and smoked like a train. I would have gone only I had been working very hard with fuck all days off for months. He understood though, and later admitted he would have faded anyway. I felt tired, not at all moody. Just drained.We both were very tired. We talked about the day before and smoked, felling like we just survived D-Day or something. I felt pleased I had showed him a good time, he looked after me well in Barcelona, my bastard bank card didn’t work in Spain, even though the cock heads in the bank said it would. He looked after me those last two days, so now were even.If the music in Fabric was a bit better it would have been the perfect end to a wonderful day. Well you can’t win them all, eh? Now I’m living in the banana republic of Ireland, and he’s living in London. Far closer to the river than I ever was. Time for me to go over and fuck him hood up no? ;>) I've been searching everywhere for someone with a similar experience, but havn't found anything.  So here goes:I was having a lonesome night, so I decided to smoke a small bowl and relax with a movie.  I would consider myself an 'experienced' smoker - smoked for about 5 yrs, regularly for about 2.  So this was no big deal.  I had a few drinks as well, but nothing over normal.  So I enjoyed the movie and everything was great.  By the time the movie was over, I noticed that I seemed unusally baked for how much I had smoked.  I didn't think anything of it, and decided I needed to pee and go to bed.  So made my way to the bathroom to pee.  When I was done, I must have stood up too fast, as my vision started to go as it sometimes does when anyone does this.  I steadied myself then realized that my legs weren't going to support me.  I feel to the floor, my vision and motor skills completly gone.  I started convulsing, but might not have even known it if it wasn't for my head which kept banging against the closed door.  I don't know if any/how much time passed after I stopped having this 'mini-seizure' or whatever.  At some point my vision came back and I stood up, very shaken but alright.I had seen this happen to a guy in Amsterdamn - the woman working at the bar gave him sugar water.  Remembering this, I grabbed a coke and headed for bed.I am wondering if anyone else had an experience like this, whether I did the right thing, or what should I do if this happens again.  (also, what causes it?  low blood sugar?) I never drank alcohol at all until I was eighteen years old and even then I never drank to exess. But then came The Captain Morgan Fiasco. I was 19 at the time and living with my boyfriend in some apartments of campus from our college. We had one of our friends over that night to engage in a rousing game of Quarters with us. I had secured a 'handle bottle' of Captain Morgan Spiced Rum for the festivities. I was planning on only sitting in for a few rounds as I am not too fond of take pure shots of liquor. But...one round turned into five and so on and so on until, between the 3 of us we had finished off the entire enormous bottle. I am not a big girl and didn't have a huge tolerance so the experience was by far the worst for me (my boyfriend was a large guy and so was our friend).[Erowid Note: The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]I ended up taking in my best estimation anywhere from 30 to 40 shots of rum. Somewhere around the tenth shot I started feeling those familiar drunken feelings but for some reason I was determined to continue playing the game. I was feeling very out going and proceeded to hug every single person that entered our apartment that night (we had another roommate who had TONS of friends) whether I knew who they were or not. Being the outgoing person that I am I began telling jokes and entertaining the growing crowd of people in our apartment while still engaging in the game of quarters. After about 5 more shots, all the strangers left and we were joined by some very close friends of mine and my boyfriend's. And this where things get bad. After about an hour and 15 more shots (shit I was dumb!) I decided that I would smoke part of a joint that my friend S started passing around. I only remember fragments after this. When the weed started to hit me I got this overwhelming feeling that I was swimming through the scene. I somehow managed to get to my feet and stumble towards the bedroom. Sara, being the wonderful girl that she is, followed me to see if I was going to be all right. I kept repeating over and over again that I just needed to take a bath and that I be fine. She ran a bath for me and she left. I stared down at the water for a while and thought to myself I will drown if I get in there so I decided to lay down for a minute. I made my way over to the bed and crashed out completely for about an hour. I have no idea how I was not in a coma at this point but I woke up and decided to rejoin my friends in the living room. That is when I realized that I had no motor skills whatsoever. I managed to roll myself out of the bed and onto the messy floor (Side note:my boyfriend and I were extreme packrats and our bedroom floor was cover in all of our random shit)Once on the floor , not being able to see a thing, revision, seeing a million of everything but not being able to make out what anything was, I dragged myself on my stomach to the door of our bedroom. At this point I just wanted to get to my friends because I was convinced that I had alcohol poisoning and was on the brink of death. When I finally reached the bedroom door and felt like I had taken an epic journey through a vast world of books, cd's, and dirty underwear, I had to somehow get to my feet. I lift myself up just enough to reach the doorknob and pulled myself up to my feet. I carefully took a step back to give myself room to open the door. When I opened the door my boyfriend was standing there, very very drunk. I must have looked terrible because he started laughing at me. He touched me on the shoulder and just this slight touch sent me to the floor once again, sprawled out on my back on a pile of boxes. In my irrational drunk state I thought that my boyfriend had violently pushed me so I stood up, crying and laughing at the same time, and shoved him with all of my might into the wall of the hallway. The next thing I remember after that was sitting up in bed about 4 hours later and violently vomiting all over myself and our bed. I was still very drunk and could not walk at all. But I remember being very thankful that I had woken up BEFORE I vomited. I crawled across the expanse of the bedroom floor, again, to the bathroom and found my boyfriend passed out with his head in the toilet. I shook him until he came to and I immediately burst into tears and kept repeating 'Let's never do this again!' We both dragged ourselves into the living room and stayed awake for the next two hours smoking pot and promising each other that we would never EVER have another night like that again. Aftermath: I found out the next day from my two sober friends (our other drinking buddy was fine save for a morning of intense puking) that I had stumble around for about an hour after I had gotten out of bed the first time and thrown up in almost every room of the house (including our roommates bedroom). I kept rambling on and on about how I was dying and that I had never done anything important in my life. There was also a crack from floor to ceiling in the wall that I had pushed my boyfriend into.In the months that followed that my boyfriend and my relationship began to deteriorate due to extreme alcohol abuse and violence. I decided to clean myself up after that and leave him. In the 3 years since my Captain Morgan fiasco, I have never, never, gotten to a point like that from alcohol again. It all happened the night of a university drinking contest. Before I left for the contest I already found myself to be enraged for some reason, but I didn't pay much attention to it and thought : 'well lets  just get hammered again and forget everything'So I set of to the pub and started the contest, I think I had about 15 beers in 3 hours (could have been more). After that we went to a party where I drank some more...and from then on my memory is shattered.So most of what I write now is what people told me afterwards.It was a party organized by some international student association and  apparently I met some foreign students. Those guys had some kind of strong alcohol with them (80%). I don’t know if I drank some of it, but I suppose I did. Next thing I remember I'm in my own car with one of those lads driving it !!!! Why? I really really don’t know ! Everything went blank from then on and the next thing I know I wake up in a police station.So what happened that night? Apparently we drove to where those foreigners resided for a week, and for some reason I must have REALY flipped out in that building. I tried to bust in a door leading to some sort of television room, it didn't work though so I broke the glass in that door and crawled through it, injuring my hand. Once inside I managed to yank a large wooden board from the wall and smashed the window leading outside with it. At that time some guys who where staying there heard all the commotion and found me there, in a frenzy of anger and despair and the entire room smeared with blood ! They managed to get me to the parking lot and tried to calm me down, cause I was in a SUICIDAL state. They didn't succeed however and had to call the cops (the guys who tried to call me were military for crying out loud !).I can tell you, waking up in jail and hearing that story is not at all funny ! The cops said that witnesses had explained to them that I was running round like a psycho trying to kill myself.This experience of course opened my eyes, I indeed had a SERIOUS problem that needed professional care. Later my dad explained to me that my family had a history of alcohol abuse and suicide, which explains a lot since I’ve been having psychological problems my whole life.After that experience I stopped drinking alcohol for 3 months and stopped smoking weed for a week ( I hadn't even had weed that awful night !!!!!), the reason I did stop smoking for a week is that I wanted to grant myself 'a moment of clarity' since I've been smoking every day for 3 years...and wanted to pin point the exact problem in a sober manner before I went into therapy.Therapy indeed seemed to be the sanest solution, I don’t wanna walk around like a walking time bomb waiting to kill someone else or myself... I am 16 years of age, I live in the UK and I have been drinking a lot in my life so far, I am writing this report to tell others my experiences with this widely used drug.I can't remember my first experience with alcohol, I must have been very young 2-3 (even though my mother drank a lot when I was developing in her womb). Both my parents are alcoholics, I guess it is their way of coping with their very busy, stressful life. I remember a story about my brother when he was 2 my grandfather gave him a pint of beer and he forgot how to walk. I never really drank a lot before I was 15. But I remember I was sometimes allowed some alcohol at family diners and at Christmas, once I got a bottle of cherry brandy in my stocking at Christmas. I would sometimes sneak some of my parents’ alcohol and drink some now and then but never a lot.One time when I was quite young, 8-9 I got a wine making kit for my birthday. I had a lot of fun making the wine, but when it was ready to drink I drank the most I have ever drunk before then, it was the first time I have ever thrown up, that was a horrible experience and I stopped drinking after that till I was 15.At 15 I started smoking cannabis habitually, I was in my last year of school and this affected my schoolwork very badly I would be smoking loads. But one weekend my two best friends (Lets call them J and N) and me decided we were getting bored of smoking pot and we decided to get drunk. We obtained it by standing outside a shop and asking passers by to go in and get it for us. We got a litre bottle of vodka and we went to a secret spot where J, N and me proceeded to get very drunk we really enjoyed this and made our friendships closer. We began to do this more regularly, about once a week. We all stopped smoking pot because it was sapping our money away and we lost enjoyment for it. We had a lot of fun in those days, we made stupid videos and enjoyed our last school days.On my birthday this year I finally got out of school, I had a lot of parties after then at my house with a lot of my friends where people got drunk and smoked cannabis. My parents normally had no idea I had people round. After school there was a time where we took our final exams. After the exams each day J, N and I would go to this den I made in the woods and we would get drunk of alcohol I had stolen of my parents. I even got drunk for one of my exams, French, and I got the highest possible mark I could get for it (C).After my exams I didn’t see any of my friends even J and R for a while in the holidays. I became good friends with my sister and went out with her and her friends a lot I made loads of new people I started drinking everyday. I went to parties, group gatherings everyday, by this point I had given up pot all together. Alcohol helped me deal with meeting loads of new people it helped me connect and make new friends because I used to be a very shy person At this point it was so easy to get hold of alcohol as some of my friends where over 18 or looked over and a lot of people had it on them. I have noticed the same time I started drinking heavily is the same time I started smoking tobacco quite heavily, about 10-25 a day.I finally managed to get hold of J and N and they came out. That day they both came out I introduced them to my new friends and we all got drunk. I have never seen my friend N as drunk as I saw him that day he came onto nearly all of my new friends that were female and made himself a bit of a reputation since none of the girls liked him. During the holidays I was still partying all the time J and N came round very often. I lost my virginity one night with this girl and I regret it, I was drunk I didn’t like her and I didn’t even use a condom and she was a complete slut.But after the holidays it had to all stop because most of my friends when back to school some too college some to work, I was the only one who didn’t get anything to do for this year, I never signed up for sixth-form or college and have never had a job (and still don’t). I started doing nothing all day I’d get very bored so I’d regularly steal some of my parents alcohol, I’d drink in the day a lot. All my friends started calling me an alcoholic, they told me that they rarely saw me sober and apparently they could tell when I was sober because I was grumpy. I paid no attention to them, I continued to drink to this day. I invite J and N out every Friday and Saturday to come get drunk with me.That is a summery of my life so far with alcohol. I tried many drugs but nothing has stuck with me like alcohol. I drink because it makes by life more fun, it’s almost like life is boring without it. One day I wish to give up my drinking habit I never want to turn into my parents and be an alcoholic. But I should do something about it or I’ll be heading that way. Thanks for reading. I've been drinking pretty much every day for the past year. I first started (heavily anyway) when I met my now ex-boyfriend last May (2003) It started out as a few beers every night. I just wanted to be more confident around him/his friends/my friends but it's turned into more. I can go a day without a drink but I prefer not to- in fact since that day in May I've probably only gone a handful of days without a beer or two. Most often I at least attempt to get a buzz before passing out. When I started out I could have 3 beers and get a buzz it now takes 8-9 (that's if I drink quickly) and I'm a girl who only weighs 120-125. I can out drink my friends under the table and hang with the best of them- something I used to be proud of until I stared being known as the 'alcoholic' among my friends. I pretty much gave everything up for alcohol, school, friends, work, etc. Which is funny because in high school I was popular and did go to a few parties but I was never in any big trouble. I graduated as a member of nhs ranked 80/600, 3.8 gpa, with honors, and as a Texas Scholar. I remember the first time I got drunk I was 17 and drank half a bottle of cheap whiskey with two friends. They ended up carrying me into my house and one of my friends who spent the night puked on my bed (as did I) and we both slept in it. I never did drink much after that just smoke pot. My parents would go out of town maybe 2-4 times a year and I would always throw a party and all the left over alcohol would be stored in my closet, I never thought about drinking it, especially without my friends. But now a drink sitting there that long (I live alone now) is unheard of. But like I said earlier I gave up everything. I spent all of my money (I also starting spending it on coke not long after I started drinking regularly) My parents we're alcoholics and always warned me against it but it's hard to resist and once I start it's hard to stop. I used to have a great job and after a year (once I started drinking) I would go into work drunk and smelling of alcohol and it wasn't long after that I was fired. I then started to get pissed at my parents because the wouldn't let me stay out drinking or they would get mad when I came in drunk so I moved out. Now I either stay out all night drinking or get drunk by myself. I borrow money from my family and friends constantly just so I can get a six pack or bottle of vodka for the night. And as for my friends they kept trying to tell me that I was going down the wrong path but when you are drunk and anxious to have another beer it's hard to listen so pretty soon they quit hanging out with me. I've been trying to amend all my relationships and it's working a bit. We've all started to hang out more I'm trying to balance my addiction with them but I'm sure they will find out soon. I also got kicked out of college last semester because I would get too drunk to attend class, or would be passed out well into the afternoon. I've also been trying to fix that this semester but I've already withdrawn from two classes because they were too early and I couldn't get drunk fast enough the night before to get up early enough for them. I also like doing everything drunk. I've gone to job interviews, class, court, seen family members, friends etc. It just seems like if I'm not drunk or at least buzzed then it's not right I'm not 'myself' One last thing I want to tell is this- I got a dui, my bac was 3xs over the legal limit and I had a glass of wine in the car with me (I'm only 19, 18 at the time of arrest) and I started going to AA meetings but even when I first went in to see the counselor I was drunk, in fact after I got out of jail (I was in at 11pm out at 3am) I was already pouring a glass of wine and driving my car (drunk again) to buy cigarettes. I never even skipped a beat after being arrested I wasn't even close to being sober when they let me out and I had no problem in having another drink as soon as I got back to my place.  Alcohol can be a good thing when used in moderation. I've had some good things happen to me- more friends, an ok job, connections (to more alcohol hah). I've also had bad things but it seems I've been able to remedy most of them with just a little alcohol (friends, new job, college) Sad I know but I feel more confident with alcohol and I can relate and interact better with people (it seems that way to me anyway). All I know is when I'm drunk or buzzed I feel great and can do anything, when I'm hung-over and withdrawn all I can do is sleep and feel depressed. If you had told me about all this or asked me about alcohol a year ago I would've told you no way. In fact as I write this at 6am (still haven't gone to bed) I'm drinking wine and have been doing so all night along with vodka and beer. Every year on Halloween I do the candy thing; being 20 however the idea sounded a little stale this time, so I decided it was finally time to do the party thing instead.  I met up with my friend J at about 1 pm; we drove in his car out to the depths of whatever Portland, Oregon has of a ghetto and to the place of our other friend S where he waits with his girl and his buddy T.  S had a gallon of Monarch rum which we mixed into two 2-liter containers of Coke; S also sold me a 60 bag of pot in two installments, an eight bag ($40) of good quality and 20 of really high quality shit.  We hang at S's moms apartment smoking bowls until it gets a little darker, mischief requires cover of course.  J at this point reveals that he's shitfaced on pills, a few percocet and some valium if I remember correctly, and that he (wisely) has decided to refrain from drinking; as it is he's the designated driver.  As darkness descends, we head out, driving somewhere to some party and guzzling our coke and rum as we went.  Most of the night went like this: drink a shitload, wander around and find a party to crash, go to the party and smoke a bowl with whoever seemed cool or knew us, leave, repeat.  Things get blurry around 5pm, but most of the time I wasn't even looking at a clock.  We took T home before it got dark because he got bored and wanted to go get laid; which was nice because there was more booze for us and besides, J's car is VERY small.  At some point we decided to do some trick or treating, mostly out of bordom because we couldn't find any Bush signs to mess with.  The last thing I can really remember was being at some of S's friends' house where he and his girl wound up sleeping; S handed me the remains of the second bottle and I took a huge guzzle from it.  Up until this point I was pretty smashed, but still lucid.  I lose my ability to articulate myself pretty fast when I drink, so I was slurring a good bit, but not unbalanced in walking and certainly not in a memory black out.  That last bit must have sent me over the edge though, I remember nothing of the ride back to my place with J or even coming home.  I remember a little bit of being in the house, I noticed the trash sitting around (it's my job to take out the trash on Sundays), and I know I microwaved something.  I woke up at 6:30 in the morning still fully dressed, but in bed, and wondering how the hell it all ended; this is where it gets funny.  When I asked my mom if she seen or heard me the previous night (keep in mind up until now that I had no recollection of talking to or seeing anybody when I got home) she told me my sister had talked to me, and had warned her against it (this set me to wondering).  She said my dad made some remark about me being 'unsteady' as I went down the stairs but nothing else, I had to wait for my sister to come home from school to hear the juicy part.  According to my sister; she and her friend came home from some shindig at around 11:30 pm, when they went inside her room they found trash spilled all over the floor.  She came into my room where I was emptying my own trash and *nicely* informed me I had spilled trash in her room, to which I turned and yelled at her 'I don't want confrontation!'.  I then followed her into her room and stood by the door with the bag gaping open just looking at her while she picked up all this crap that I had spilled, when she asked me for some help I bellowed 'Just show me where it goes!'.  I didn't even notice her friend, who was extremely confused, and apparently I didn't notice anyone else either unless they made their presence specifically known.  The weird part is the way my sister described me: I was walking very straight and upright as opposed to typical slouching drunk posture, I wasn't stumbling unless I was walking on stairs (though I would lean against walls or doors for support and couldn't stand still without wavering), and I had a paralyzed, crazy look on my face.  I still haven't put together the pieces on why I would have behaved like that; I've never EVER been a belligerent or loud drunk, I just can't talk or walk most of the time, and if I drink a lot at once I tend to pass out for several hours at a time during which I am COMPLETELY unresponsive and unrousable.  I think because I remained active throughout the night it prevented me from passing out, so instead I slipped into some limbic operating state where I was oblivious to what was actually happening, and responded to unknown crap that was going on in my own head.  That's the only logical conclusion I can think of, because that type of behavior is completely out of character for me.  The one good thing out of all of it though?  No hangover! I am a connoisseur of many drugs, a drug fan, as I often call myself.  I have taken almost everything, except heroin, mescaline, NN-DMT (I've taken 5-MEO-DMT), and PCP.  LSD, Methamphetamine, Crack, everything else I have consumed.  I have emerged from such a bewildering and at times overwhelming array of licit and illicit pharmaceutical experiences unscathed.  But, Alcohol, a substance that my father is also addicted to, has latched onto me, or rather, I have latched on to it.  I smoke pot everyday, my brain lives in a realm of THC, and I used to be concerned about my constant cannabis consumption.  I used to feel 'burned out' and I thought that my memory was slightly impaired, I thought I had lost all motivation even in the activities that I am most impassioned about.  Until I began to drink, when a new definition of 'burned out' emerged.  Now my memory has been fried to utter shit and my head is a wasteland.  I actually feel, in a terrifyingly literal sense, like the walking dead.  I never saw alcohol coming.  I always partied and never thought anything about alcohol.  I was always worried about getting hooked on speed or something like that, but no...it was alcohol...and there's nothing like it.  I struggle like hell to not drink for even one day, and I, most of the time, cannot drink less than five drinks in an hour let alone in an entire sitting.  It started before I was 21 years old, but when I turned 21, the devil and I got acquainted well, and we became the best of friends.  I used to drink a 40 of malt liquor every night (because it only cost $1.80 or something).  Now I consume as much alcohol as I can, because I've grown to love that state of drunken immobilization.  Alcoholism is such a strange form of drug addiction, one that so many people take for granted.  No one thinks of alcohol when 'crazy hard drugs' are mentioned.  It is a hard fucking drug.  The system lies when it justifies alcohol in this ridiculous 'war on drugs.'  I wake up every morning with a feeling in my head that I call 'KFC brains,' named of course after the Kentucky Fried Chicken.  My organs ache, my brains feel like melted crayon wax, I can taste alcohol in my mouth all day long.  I've long forgotten that I have a limit to how much I can drink, I don't think any more, I'll drink shots and beers and more shots without question.  One night at a party I drank so much, yet I did not notice that I had, and to my horror, I realised that I had blacked out for hours and that I was on the floor covered in my own vomit.  It was so degrading, I feared that I may have been the freakish spectacle, and that pretty girls may have watched me writhing in a pool of my puke.  I was so drunk that it was almost a kind of psychedelic experience, I couldn't believe  how fucked up I was.  I get drunk and I pop Vicodins, Soma's, Flexarils, Ativans, Xanax's and Darvocets (not all at once of course).  Because I'd sell my soul for those soothing lows.  I make foolish decisions and I throw in money for Cocaine that I don't even have ( because I've spent it on liquor).  I lust for those drugs, but it always starts with alcohol, because alcohol is the basis for all of my insanity.  I say that I won't drink some nights and I usually end up drinking, and if I don't drink I pop pills and smoke all of the weed that I try to conserve.  When I think about drinking I get this weird self destructive fire inside, this instinct to create chaos and facilitate my slow death.  Alcohol is the hardest, and most addictive drug, now that I've come to live my life with it.  I can't fathom quitting, I don't want to.  I wish I could just go back to the time when I could only drink once a week, things were in equilibrium then.  But not now, since I've become a demon of alcohol, possessed by its dark magic.  I've have been enlightened in many ways by every drug I've taken (mostly the hallucinogens, the tryptamines, the indole compounds and Salvia Divinorum have changed my life for the better).  But alcohol, it has a different message, that takes longer to figure out.  It's all very masochistic.  I am constantly fighting extreme depression and suicidal ideation.  I love that transcendent alcohol state of blissful brain fry in which one is all powerful and does not give a fuck about anything.  I am trapped between love and hate.  I love you alcohol, and I hate you. Before this experience, the only time I ever drank alcohol it was in reasonable amounts. Nothing more then a few glasses of wine at a holiday event or a beer with my friends. But I was fourteen years old, and I was so curious to see what would happen if I got really drunk.It all happened because my friend R invited me to spend the night at her house. We smoked cigarettes all day, and when night came, we tried to go to sleep. It was 3 o'clock in the morning when I suddenly said, 'Let's get drunk!'It took a while, but I finally convinced R that we should go for it. We walked over to the bar she has in her basement, and I took a seat on the stool as she brought out a large bottle of vodka. She mixed about four shots of vodka with cranberry juice, and poured it into a large glass.We both took turns drinking from it. When it was all gone, I was feeling warm and happy and a definite mood lift! I was laughing easily at anything R said. This, of course, was not enough. I wanted to get plastered!So, R took a bottle of Cinnamon Schnapps from the fridge, and two different shot glasses. She poured us each a shot, and then counted down. We both downed our shots at the same time, and then repeated the process. She was putting the bottle back into the fridge when I begged her for two more shots. My speech was slightly slurred, but I don't think she noticed.Both of us downed two more shots. It tasted like Hot Tamales! Very strong. I got off the stool and immediately took a seat onto the floor. R laid down on the couch and I tried to talk to her, but she was drifting in and out of sleep, and I was trying desperately to keep her awake.'R, don't fall asleep, please don't,' I begged her, like a child. Everything seemed to mean much more than it usually would. Topics in my mind made me so emotional! I was thinking about how glad I was that R was my friend, she was so nice, etc.I would look from R to the wall, and it was as if I was seeing things in slow motion. My vision would be slow, and as a consequence, have to 'catch up with itself' when I stopped looking around so fast. I found this insanely interesting, and proceeded to move my head really fast. It was difficult to focus on anything, almost like everything in my line of vision was blurry. Finally, I got up to use the bathroom and I had SUCH a hard time walking. I felt so sad when I knocked off a wall decoration trying to make my way to the bathroom. I was stumbling over my own feet, walking into walls, closing the door on myself. It wasn't pretty.Eventually I found my way back to the room and I ended up laying down on the couch. R had already fallen asleep, so I tried to do the same. The last thing I remember is thinking to myself with my words jumbled up. Then, I woke up.I had blacked out!Or at least I thought I did. Maybe I just fell asleep, I thought. I wasn't sure. I quickly sat up, wondering what had happened and how long I had been asleep. I began to panic, so I just rested myself back onto the couch and tried to sleep.I woke up later that day with a pounding headache and a dire need for a can of Coca Cola. Went drinking and drank 4 shots of expensive tequila, Petrone and 30/30.  Was highly intoxicated and went to a friends house.  While there I suggested that we smoke some pot which she has in her house most of the time.  I have smoked pot less than 10 times my entire life and most of the time, the experiences have made me sick but I decided I would try again in case it had some cool effect.  I was trying to find out the reason my friends smoke it every day.  Shortly after smoking, my husband suggested we leave and by this time, I was having trouble walking.  I was practically carried to the car and my husband told me that I needed to sober up, that I was scaring him.  He handed me a bottle of water.  I started drinking it, but then realized that I couldn't get my throat to swallow the water.  I started choking and my husband said I was just allowing the water to pour out in my lap.  I then curled my fingers (so my husband says) into tight balls and become very rigid all over my body.  I started to convulse and my facial features distorted.  My husband stopped the car and jumped out and ran around to me.  He held me and I grabbed him back and wouldn't let go.  I continued to convulse and could not answer him.  I don't remember this part.  What I remember is trying to focus on his voice and going in and out of consciousness.  I truly felt as if I were dying the small moments that I was aware of my surroundings.  Between passing in and out of consciousness, I felt like each time, I wasn't going to be able to come back to his voice, to my body.  I remember losing all sense of myself in my current position of life.  I couldn't remember my age, ( my husband was trying to ask me questions so he could be assured that I was okay)  I thought it was 8 years ago in my life.  I couldn't remember what I had done that evening.  I could tell when a seizure was coming on because my body would stiffen and all my muscles would tighten. It would scare me and I was crying.  I was going in and out of consciousness and my husband would not just let me pass out for fear of something really bad happening.  He kept asking me if I needed him to take me to the hospital while we were driving home.  I said no but he considered it anyways.  I thought in between convulsion periods that I was dying and I wouldn't ever see my kids again.  It scared me when I felt like the convulsion periods were getting longer.  I was afraid that I wouldn't wake up from one of them.  I think that my husband was afraid of the same thing too.  He hadn't smoked any of the pot.  When we finally arrived home, after him having to pull over and hold me during the convulsions, I came directly in and the walking made me throw up.  I threw up violently and then he put me in the shower, which I don't remember.  Then I remember throwing up again.  He stayed with me for fear of more convulsions.  I blacked out for about 45 minutes while still functioning, and then I came two.  I finally passed out for good about 2 hours after smoking and throwing up several times.  I am unsure why I was convulsing.  I have never had seizures in my life.  I hope that I haven't harmed anything in my brain.  I have had alcohol poisoning in my life.  Since that time, I have sleep paralysis where I awaken my mind during sleep but cannot get my body to move.  I think something was harmed during my first alcohol poisoning.  I hope that nothing was harmed with the last episode.  I will never smoke pot again. I was at a good friend of mine's party. We had done a bit of drinking that night but I wasn't hammered to the point where I couldnt control what I was doing. Around 10pm, W arrives and comes down to the basement asking who would like to try salvia. Feeling generally invincible from the alchohol, I accepted. We went outside and he loaded half the one gram bag into the bowl, expecting me to just hit it a little  bit and pass it to someone else. Unfortunately I had no idea what the effective dose was, and assumed he meant for me to down the whole bowl in one strong lungful. I put my arms to my sides, W said 'in 2 minutes C (me) is gunna go crazy.' It was more like 30 seconds...What I saw:What W said was the last coherent thought I would have for the next 50 or so minutes. Immediately after, everything in my field of vision swayed, then melted into itself. I found myself in a long bright orange tunnel, and in a state of complete terror. I was screaming in the tunnel running with every effort I had trying to escape from the tunnel and back to reality. I reached the end, and because I thought had died, I interpreted the bright light at the end of it to be God. The bright figured then spoke, 'C put on your pants!' he said, which confused me quite a bit. (It was my friend W who was talking to me). I tried to say 'I can't I'm melting into the bed.' But because I didnt feel like I was in my body, there was a delay between when I would order my lips to move and when it would actually happen. (My speech was really slurred). So, closing my eyes again, I began to melt through the bed, through the floor past the main floor and into the basement. When I awakened fully I was in my buddies bed, quite inebriated from the alchohol still and never wanting to repeat this terrifying experience again. What everyone else saw:Right after what W said about me goin crazy in 2 minutes, I conked out, my body sprawled over a very short thick wire fence. I then slipped off the fence and proceeded to huddle in a ball screaming loudly 'AHH AHH'. They carried me inside the house and put me on the bed to relax but apparently I was twitching, screaming and flailing my arms like a madman. W stayed with me to make sure I didnt do anything to injure myself, and 50 minutes or so after smoking I was good to go again, feeling generally positive but more wary about putting things into my body I know nothing about.Overall it was a good experience for me. T+4:00 - 7 or 8 beers laterAfter a long night of drinking, we retire back to my friend's room to smoke more of the Salvia.  I pack the bowl of his bong full of the 5 for him, fully ready to re-pack it for myself once he was done.  He puts the bong to his lips, inhales, and immediately coughs out all the smoke.  Not wanting to be one to waste any substance, I immediately pick up the bong and smoked all that is left of his bowl (if I had to guess, maybe 1/4g of the 5X extract).  WOWWhat I experienced next is possibly the most incredibly psychotropic experience of my life.Colors... whirling... spinning... flying....  After about a minute I'm aware of the fact that there are 2... [What’s?] People sitting there....  they know something [English??] that I can't figure out...Something about them being the all-knowing, all experiencing beings of the universe....After a few minutes of swirling, pulsating madness, I realize these to be my friends, but still can't figure out any way to communicate with themAfter a few tries at 'Bleh the thing wertng ghann...'  and ' you're then tharrs... blehn therrrg....', I finally re-mastered the English language... but nothing I could think of was letting me express to them what had just happened.The only way I can describe this is:  POWERFUL. I was going into this experience expecting very little, but came out a changed person. The absolute power behind this drug is something unparalleled in my years of experience. It was about 11:50 and we had just gotten out on a half day.  ME and my friends 'R' and 'K' went wandering down the main drag in our town in San Diego searching for a friendly booze buying bum.  Low and behold, we found one about an hour later.  We gave him money and he gave us his unopened 40oz. so we knew he wouldn't make off with the Bacardi Limon he was about to buy us.  He bought us a 1/5th and we found the worst place in the world for underage high school kids to drink, the bowling alley.  We then proceeded to get cups for 'water' and I had two Large styrofoam cups of it, and 'R', after finishing his two cups, proceed to drink the rest of 'K's second cup due to the fact that she is a lightweight beyond beleif, and me and 'R' being more experienced drinkers finished off the rest of the bottle.  I had to leave to go home and I arrived, stumbling, reeking, and having no idea what time it was, told my dad id be skating outside.  I then found my other friend 'R' and I layed down on the sidewalk.  I didn't feel too drunk considering I had drank a little less than half a 1/5th on a completely empty stomach.  I went into my room and layed down with a trash can by my head and tossed about 20 times, and the last few times, it was blood red, and I knew something wasn't quite right.  I threw up around 70 times that night, mostly blood and bile, and I finally realized I had alcohol poisoning.  I looked up through my soggy eyes in the mirror and saw a spinning room, then myself falling down, and I fell into the bath tub.  I immediately stood up and went to my room. I passed out, occasionally waking up to puke, and that lasted about 12 hours.  I never went to the hospital, never told my dad what I did, and all I had to show for it the next day was a really sore throat and various sore innards.  My friend 'R' wasn't so lucky, he fell on the way home and hit his head, causing permanent brain damage, and also got alcohol poisoning.  'K' just went home fucked up and played solitaire for a few hours and fell asleep. First I'd like to mention that I have had very few experiences with any drug.  I smoked pot for about a year, done shrooms once, and DXM and Dramamine a few times.  Now with that said onto the experience.A friend and I went to a larger city to party on New Year's Eve and noticed a small 'gift' shop.  We went in and I noticed Salvia 10x.  I had read a lot about it and had wanted to try it for some time...what better time than New Year's Eve?  I bought a gram and went off to a party.  At the party I had about 3 bottles of champagne and my friends had the munchies so we took off to a grocery store.  One person went in and the other 2 stayed in the car with me and I thought what better time to try the Salvia. I loaded a bowl and smoked it.  I felt pretty relaxed and had the distinct feeling that something just wasn't right with the world.  I decided another bowl would help so I loaded it and smoked.  This is where everything started and I apologize if I'm vague.  Much of this is a blur and there really doesn't seem to be words in the English language to describe what this was like.The first thing I noticed was that I was seeing snake-like things everywhere and this caused me to laugh uncontrollably.  Then one of my friends was 2-D for the most part.  The front part of his body was there but from the ears back wasn't.  I mumbled something about him not having a brain and went on to try to say 'I feel weird guys.'  Well, I couldn't pronounce weird.  I tried a few more times without success and looked down at my hand which seemed to be holding something.  I was holding the word weird.  I held it up for them to read for themselves but they couldn't see it.  I attempted to read it to them but once again I failed.  Then I got the bright idea to smoke another bowl.After the bowl I started feeling dizzy and like I was being pushed back into the car's seat head first.  As my head penetrated the seat the feeling of being extremely stoned and drunk was appearing.  At first the seat suck me in slowly but then it hit my neck and I just fell back through it.  I remember being in complete blackness for a while and possibly having a mental conversation with something.  I came to in a flash not knowing who these people were or where I was.  After about ten minutes I was convinced I knew them and they were friends.  They had said I was mumbling incoherently for the past twenty minutes and was just staring out the window.  Thats about all I remember but next time I'm going to try it sober in a safe place.  This stuff is extremely powerful and had I not been drunk it probably would have scared the piss out of me.  Oh yeah, the next day I felt changed.  Everything felt right and better than ever. My outlook on life seemed better and I was in a great mood despite a massive hangover. I am writing this to express how I felt on the summer of 2005 which has passed about 8 months ago or more. My friends and I were bored and we decided to go to are 'underground' hideout in the basement of an abandond resturant not to far from my house. Now during this period during my summer vacation I was doing nothing besides drinking and getting high with my friends. Ok so me and about 5 other of my friends started a siph of 2 bottles of Vodka, a 2 Liter of a cheap vodka called Aristocrat, and a 1.75 liter of Georgi Vodka. We were all sitting on chairs in this underground spot we always went to and starting passing the bottles around with a 2 liter chaser of Sprite. As the siph continued I started to feel myself become heavily intoxicated. Despite my knowing I was already heavily drunk I continued to chug the bottles that were passed to me followed by an occasional couple of sips of the chaser. As time went on my friends became bored and started to leave. I had to get up now and tried to follow them out of the hideout spot and when I stood up from my chair I could barley even stand straight. Now keeping in mind I had obviously drank so much more then everyone else and was feeling so drunk that I started to run fast on the sidewalk when I found my way out, and luckily was saved by my brother in law and best friend as I was recklessley running across the bussy street of Richmond Ave where I live. In a very short amount of time I had fallen face down numerous times, and was unable to get up for almost a minute in those short periods of Hell I call it, because I had absolutley no control of what I was doing and I soon fell face down on a sidewalk near my local Deli, and thank god by brother was right there to save my life by calling the Ambulance. Before I realized it I was swinging punches at anyone who went near me when I got up for a bried period of time of what I could even remeber, which most was a complete blurr. I am now in the ER about to get my stomach pumped and handcuffed to the hospital bed because I was out of control and rekless at that bad state of Hell. When I finally woke up about 10 or so hours later the doctor said I had dranken myself to a stupor and he said I was very lucky to still be alive from the amount of alcohol that was in me. I had experienced Hell in my mind and am fortunate to even be here telling this story. It is now about 9 or so months after this horrible experience, and I still drink but I now know my limit and am more safe when it comes the my BAC. I find it pretty messed up that I later found out that the people that I thought were my 'friends' were only there for their amuzement, being me, besides one best friend Anthony that was there that day who actually cared about me along with my brother in law. I am usually by myself now chillin by myself or with my brother in law, and feel a lot better about myself now that I'm no longer hanging out with people who don't give a crap about me. Out of everyone that was there that day Anthony is the only one I still see occassionally when we hand out in each others houses. I made a mistake, which is hangin out with the wrong people just because their there because they have nothin better to do besides being street bums and backstabbers. It all started on Friday when I arranged for an acquantiance to pick me up 1 liter of cheap ass Vodka.  He was to drop it off in my mailbox on saturday night. Well, about 8 saturday night I'm watching T.V and I see someone's car pull up to the mailbox and drop my acquaintance out, vodka in hand, right as the my next door neighbors pulling out of the driveway.  I was like 'Shit!  He's gonna get the cops called on him'.  Well, he waits for them to leave, makes sure no one's watching, slides in the vodka and runs to his house.I made up some story to get out of the house to pick up the vodka, I was lucky I was able to smuggle it in with my pants, the bottle was pretty big.I snuck up to my room to take a look at it.  I hadn't planned on drinking any that night, mainly because I didn't know how much a liter was.  However, as I looked at how much I had, I figured what the fuck, I'll have enough left over for the party next week if I have a little now.Now it had been about 2 years since the last time I had got drunk, about 5 since I last had vodka, so I wasn't really sure of the dosage I wanted.  I decided to steal a little shot glass that no one used anymore.  I figured about 4 of those should be enough.  So I took my 4 shots and about 30 minutes later I'm feeling pretty good, I'm warm all over like when I smoke cannibis, everything seems like its almost a dream.  Things are getting all wavy and fuzzy when I move past them or they move past me, and it makes me laugh almost uncontrolably.  At this time I was getting some slurred speech and it was getting increasingly difficult to walk or stand up.  I did something a little stupid and decided to have 2 more shots. About 40 minutes after I took those shots I decided to go outside and smoke a cigarette.  When I came in I was a little bit too drunk, I was still feeling pretty good, but my complete loss of balance and the way I swayed back and forth when I stood up was really making me feel uncomfortable.  Quite unexpectedley I felt the urge to vomit, I would have probably made it to my bathroom, but I was too slow, my mind could see beforehand that I had to puke, but my body was too slow to make the connection and run to the bathroom.  This lead to me vomiting right on my carpet.  The alcohol helped the vomiting actually.  Normally there's nothing I fear more than vomiting, but with the alcohol it felt just as normal as coughing or sneezing.  I didn't mind one bit.  I actually think the cigarette induced the vomiting, I think I got too much smoke in my stomach, and this lead to it, but of course, the alcohol didn't help.Luckly there wasn't a lot of vomit.  My parents were up and I didn't want them to see. So I figured I'd go to sleep now, and clean it up early in the morning.Well, I went to bed, woke up about 6 the next morning, cleaned everything up, went back to sleep and woke up feeling clean and refreshed.  The only downside of this experience was the vomiting and the discomfort that came after .  O yea, and the cleaning up my own puke deal, I didn't like that much either.Although I did have an overall good experience, thing could have been worse. I began the testing by timing the amount of vodka I was about to consume.  I drank approximiately 3/4 the bottle of expensive vodka, mixed with fresh squeezed orange juice.  I was with my girlfriend, but she was sober and just observing me, making sure I didn't over do it.  Well, I drank for about 3 hours. felt pretty loaded.  then I popped 6, 10mg tabs of Valium to cap off the night.  I felt the effects of the valium 15 to 20 minutes after administering them orally.  At first, it was the usual dry mouth, slurred speech and clumsiness.  All this occured indoors, I was sitting in my den, looking at a picture of a bear.  I began feeling very sleepy, due to the valium.  Everything seemed slower, my stereo was on, but the noise somehow bothered me.  I decided to call it a night.  Once I got up from my chair, I immediately stumbled backwards and landed on my butt, and banged my head.  My girlfriend came in and looked at me.  I quickly stood up and realized I had lost all sense of balance. (Severe ataxia)  my mouth was dry, but somehow I managed to walk up my stairs, and slowly crawl into bed.  I put my headphones on and timed myself to see how long I could stay awake.  I was unconsciounse in about 30 seconds.  My girlfriend took the data.   the most severe effect of the Valium was probably the total loss of balance.  I awoke 3 hours later to urinate.  I got up from bed, and again fell on the stereo, my girlfriend woke up and helped me up,  as soon as she let go, I fell on my desk.  Well, the next morning i did not have a hangover.  But, wow, 60mg of Valium will sure make me lose your balance. it's scary, but insightful. I just thought that I would share my experience of the first time I got real drunk. I am 19 and in college and drink only once in a while. I had gone over to a friend's room to watch movies and have our own private little 'party'. It was just the two of us. I had done some drinking with him in the past and that had been fun. At those times I only had around 2-3 shots of vodka. That was enough for a good buzz and I would feel fine the next day. Well this time I wanted to see what it was like to get real drunk. I started with two shots mixed with powerade. Soon after I felt the familiar effects like before. We watched our first movie and during it had two more shots with juice. During the second half of the movie I was quite messed up. I was having trouble figuring out what was happening in the movie. When it was almost over I decided to have my final two shots and then it hit me hard. I had a hard time pouring it and my friend said I probably should not drink anymore. By the time 11:00 pm, and the second movie, came around I was far gone. This is where it got interesting. I remember laughing at the movie for no real reason. I kept 'zoning out' and could not figure out anything in the movie. At this point I could not walk, talk, or see too well. My friend told me that I was real messed up. I only had to ask him to repeat everything he said a few times to figure out what he said. I kept on saying random, slurred words that probably made no sense. I think that is why he kept ignoring me! Now keep in mind that my friend only had around 3 shots so he was functioning fine. Plus he weighed more then me and was more tolerant of alcohol. Keep in mind as well that I had drank all of this over the course of 1 and 1/2 hours with a pretty empty stomach.At midnight he said it was time for me to go back home. He would not let me leave on my own because he did not think I could get back in my current state. He claimed I told him we should head out the front entrance, right by the office. I don't remember saying that! Well we left out the back entrance of his dorm and I kept running into the walls. Once outside I did not even feel the cold winter air because my body was totally numbed up. I tripped over a curb and he had to pretty much carry me up the hill. I dropped my keycard to unlock my dorm building so he had to do it. At this point I said I was sorry and this other voice from behind me said 'That is okay.' I did not recall seeing anyone else behind us! After we got inside my friend said that the other guy was really drunk too. I had no clue that there was someone else out there. Once in my room I did something odd. My roommate is really messy and he has stuff all over. Fortunately he was not there at the time. Well I was trying to get a drawer open and all his stuff was in the way. I then got real mad and started throwing the stuff out of my way. Then the garbage can was also in my way and I started to kick it and punch it. Then I finally figured that moving it was a better way to go. I realized the next day that I had put three cracks in the plastic! oops! My friend did not bother to do anything to stop me. Why should he?At this point I got ready for bed and then my friend left.After laying in bed for a few minutes I suddenly felt really nauseous. I got to the toilet and threw up black stuff for about 5 minutes. I had not eaten much prior to my drinking. I assume that was bile and left over chips from earlier. Once that was done I finally got back to bed and slept until 8:30 am. It was a VERY good thing I was sleeping on my stomach and not my back. When I woke up I quickly noticed that I had thrown up during the night. There was vomit on my bedsheets and on my pajamas. Not a nice way to wake up! I have no memory of doing this. Well I could not sleep anymore in this condition so I got up. I quickly realized that I was still very dizzy and 'off' I had a little headache and my stomach was not in the best shape. I took a shower, drank some chocholate milk and did some laundry. I felt better in an hour.Looking back I have learned a lot. Now I know my limit of alcohol. I know that I stayed in control pretty well, but I was still very lucky. First off I am glad that few people saw me like this. I am even more thankful I did not get in any legal trouble. Being in the U.S. I would get in nice legal trouble for being underage and very intoxicated. Next I could have hurt myself real bad but I didn't. I am glad my friend was watching over me and helped me back to my room. I am VERY glad I did not choke on my vomit during the night. That could have been real bad!!! This was a nice experience but I did not like how I could not remember it all. I had to watch the second movie again because I did not remember a thing about it the next day. Also being sick was not fun. I don't think I will drink this much again. Unless I am willing to accept the risks with it. But now I prefer to go with a gentle buzz, not full intoxication. I have no major urge to do it again. Alcohol is fun but I can live without it. However it is fun for a change of pace.  My advice: Alcohol is powerful stuff!For this experience I had not taken any other substances. I don't do ANY drugs because I have no desire to. I don't do any street, prescription, or over the counter stuff. A friend of mine is taking a bartending course and was eager to test out his new cocktail making skills.  I was eager to be the labrat and so was another friend of mine.  We went to the liquor store and splurged about $50 on liquor (vodka, whiskey, rum), he already had mixers like triple sec, and vermouth at his house.  So we got back to his house and invited a few friends over and started knocking back cocktails.Now I've been drunk before many times in my life, but usually when I tread into the realms of 14 alcohol units plus, I risk all kinds of misadventures.  Ie. vomitting, hangovers, anger, sadness, saying stupid things, and blacking out, however tonight I managed to drink far more than that and have a really great time, hangover free.I easily had 20 units of alcohol, about 16 shots of liquor in cocktails, plus 4 beers.  I drank very quickly and recklessly, the alcohol wasn't even kicking in until i was on my sixth cocktail.  And then when I felt I was really drunk, I did the smartest thing.  I stopped drinking.  Usually I'd nurse a bottle of Jack Daniels until I fell asleep and those are the nights I don't enjoy, and wakeup in the worst state.After I stopped drinking, about an hour and a half after we started, we went for a walk to go get some sandwiches, and it proved to be very fun just to be out and about.  We were out walking and eating for around two hours and when we got back to my friends house we noisily polished off about 3 glasses of water each.  I fell asleep on the floor and woke up at 7am feeling really good, had a pee and a couple more glasses of water and was in a great headspace all day.  I remembered the entire night, and didn't feel guilty about anything.So, I'm going to try and remember when drinking, to stop when enough's enough and just enjoy the alcohol as opposed to attempting to drink the most alcohol I possibly can. Every September, my town throws a weekend-long festival celebrating the town's history.  It's apparently one of the five largest gatherings in Minnesota, or something.  Thousands of slightly overweight tourists descend upon the town, pretty much shutting everything down.  This all takes place at the beginning of the school year, and it's always the first 'event' that high schoolers use as an excuse to drink.  It was during this weekend that I got drunk for the first time.Two friends of mine, who I will refer to as 'Nick' and 'Paul' had invited me to 'get fucked up' with them, and I enthusiastically said yes.  Having heard of the evils of underage drinking for years, I was understandably curious about it.  I told my parents that I would be staying the night at Paul's house, and took off.  After obtaining alcohol, we wandered through the crowds of people downtown for a while, and then made our way towards a friend's ('Tim') apartment.  We threw an Aphex Twin album on the stereo and took out our alcohol.  I was pretty nervous, as I had heard numerous stories about how terrible this shit tasted, etc.  I took a timid swig of Limon and quickly washed it down with some Sprite.It didn't taste that awful!  My friends congratulated me on my first sip of alcohol, and each had some too.  They passed the bottle back to me, and I took several more shots.  I would estimate that I had roughly four shots of the Limon.  I wasn't feeling any effects from the alcohol, asides from a pleasantly warm belly.  We sat around talking for a few minutes, and Tim asked us if we wanted a beer.  I took one, and drank it in a little under two minutes.  Paul turned on a television and began playing Goldeneye.  I walked over to join him, and sat down in an antique weelchair that served was used as a chair, I guess.  At this exact moment, I began to feel the alcohol.As I sank into the chair, I felt as though I was sinking or falling into it.  I turned my head around, and was surprised to find that it felt incredibly heavy.  My ears were filled with a buzzing sound, and I felt pleasantly happy.  I talked with Paul for several minutes, and found that everything he said was unbelievably funny.  After a few more minutes of Goldeneye, we decided to go outside and mingle with the crowds of revelers.  As I got out of the wheelchair, I felt really undsteady, and I was sure that I was about to fall over.  We walked out of the apartment and down the two flights of stairs to the street.  I was now feeling really excited, and I couldn't wait to see what the night had in store for us.  I'm usually fairly quiet, but tonight I was keeping up a steady stream of wisecracks and conversation.  Paul and I spilled out onto the street, and realized that Nick and Tim had decided to bring the wheelchair with them.  We laughed long and hard at this, and decided that it would be fun to trick tourists into thinking that Tim was a cripple.  We took turns pushing him around, and then got bored.  We walked a block to a coffee shop and decided to chill there for a while.  By this point, I was feeling really euphoric, as well as slightly off balance.  We walked into the coffeeshop and sat down at a table.  A girl I knew from school waved at me, and I gave a confused wave back.  I was sure that I knew her, but I couldn't remember her name.  I began running threw a list of every girl's name that I could think of, and eventually remembered that she was named 'Anna'.  We spent around half an hour in the coffee shop, at which point we met up with a few other friends.  Nick had decided that tonight he had to try to find some marijuana, and when we saw two notorious local stoners, he offered to trade some of our alcohol for some of his pot.  they obliged, and handed us a bag of what turned out to be really shitty weed.  We walked back to the apartment and staggered up the stairs.  When we found the apartment door locked, we weren't exactly sure what to do.  I had the brilliant idea to hoist one of the stoners up on our shoulders, and have him wiggle into an open window above the door.  Paul and I stood facing the wall, and the stoner jumped up on our shoulders, disappearing into the apartment.  Nick sat down against a wall, laughing his head off.  The Stoner's head appeared in the window, and he informed us that he couldn't find the door.  He jumped out of the window, as Paul and I realized that we had lifted him into the wrong apartment.  Fortunately no one was home.  We walked down the hall and let ourselves into Tim's apartment.  I helped myself to another shot of Bacardi, and we just sat around and chilled for a while.  It was now getting pretty late, and we decided that it was time to head over to Paul's house.  He and I left the group, and walked the few blocks to his house.  I found it difficult to walk in a straight line, and was overjoyed, as this meant I must be pretty damn drunk.  We let ourselves in, and snuck past his sleeping parents.  I immedately fell asleep, and didn't wake up for around ten hours.  When I woke up the next morning, I was pleased to find that I wasn't the least bit hungover.  We talked about the night's events, and decided that we'd have to do it again soon.  I went home, feeling incredibly proud of myself.  It was though I had passed a major event in my life, like getting a driver's license or graduating from high school.  That was around a year and a half ago.  Since than I have had enjoyable experiences with both alcohol and marijuana.  I've also learned my limits after a couple of bad experiences.  I'm proud to say that I haven't turned into a complete fiend, like my DARE officer told me I would.  I was recently named a National Merit Scholarship semi-finalist, and am beginning to seriously look at colleges.  I feel lucky to have had such an enjoyable first-time mind altering experience, and I look forward to having many more nights like the one I described. A few months back, I was curious about the effects of alcohol. A couple of nights before the night in question, I had tried three shots of brandy and a bowl of pot, and it felt like a pretty good combination, but I didn't feel very much alcohol effect, so I decided to try some more in the near future. So in the night in question, I decided to drink six shots of Jack Daniel's Whiskey. Not knowing much about how much alcohol that contains or BAC levels, I just drank them all in a short period of time (~10-15 mins.) Afterwards, I felt pretty damn wasted. I had a really hard time walking. I went outside to smoke a bowl and afterwards I knew I was feeling really good. Afterwards, I made a really stupid mistake: taken from my experience with pot, I decided that 'more can always make it even better,' so I got another shot of whiskey and after that I went to smoke another bowl. That's the very last thing I remember.  The next thing I know, I'm dreaming and then I see the hospital. What I can't really explain is that my thoughts were at the time 'Oh no, not the hospital dream again!' As I awaken, a nurse tells me that I drank too much and that's why I was there. My dad was right in front of me. They checked to make sure I understood where I was and everything. They told me they had made me drink charcoal and had pumped my stomach. They removed an IV from my arm (for fluids) and gave me my clothes. I got dressed and went to a nearby bathroom to take a piss; urination was extremely painful (apparently they stuck a catheter in my urethra), so it took me a while. The nurse knocked and made sure I was alright... When I got out, I was greeted with a wheelchair. I sat down and was quickly rushed out of the hospital into my dad's car. I had a friendly conversation with the nurse along the way. My dad told me he had found me in my room around 3:30am; I had started drinking at 1am. He told me I was completely passed out next to a puddle of vomit and there was a pile of clothes on me. I was in some strange position under a chair and it appeared I had trouble breathing. He had thought I was dying of some drug overdose or something, as heknew I smoked pot, so he assumed I had gotten into hard drugs or something. I felt like complete shit; horrible headache, fatigue, and absolutely no motivation. It was 9:30am when I got back home; I had been in the hospital for nearly 6 hours! Fortunately, I wasn't awake for any of the painful procedures. I went to sleep immediately when I got home and woke up around 2pm. I tried to eat some cereal, but I had absolutely no appetite, so I went back to sleep. I woke up again at 6pm, and after finding that there was absolutely nothing to do, I went back to sleep. Finally, at 9pm I woke up to converse with some people, watch some TV, and eat some food. I didn't eat much and shortly afterwards went to sleep. My next day was still completely hungover. My dad took a day off work to take me to San Francisco and have a 'father-son' day with me. It was a pretty enjoyable day, but sometime in the early afternoon I began experiencing what seemed to be seizures. Earlier in the day, I had experienced some pretty annoying jaw clenching, but I disregarded it. What I later experienced was loss of muscle control; my muscles began completely tensing up and I couldn't keep my head straight, it would just start turning tothe left and I couldn't keep it in any other position. My body was shaking. We phoned a doctor friend who told me to take some Benadryl, which fixed everything. He told me I was experiencing this due to a severe alcohol intoxication. My BAC was .3%! I still had urination pain, but after I smoked my last bowl of pot the pain subsided and was pretty much gone after that. I learned later that I didn't immediately pass out. Apparently, I had also vomited outside and then for some reason I got a piece of cheese out of the kitchen and brought it into my room. I remember absolutely none of this, though. I also found sompackaging material for electrodes and such lying around from the paramedics who came and rescued me. I think I lost my favourite glass pot pipe in the ambulance as it was in my jacket and I couldn't find it after the whole  incident. I don't know if I'm ever going to try alcohol again, but if I am, it will be amongst friends and I will have to excercise extreme caution, especially since I have a pretty low body mass. I found that the extreme state of depression I had after alcohol wore off after about a week and I was in much better spirits, despite the horror of what had happened. I was visiting a friend one Hollows Eve, lets call him C. Me and C didn't have much planned on Halloween.  Just the same ol' pranks, and nicky-nicky nine doors shit as always.  I never thought I'd go to a party that night really, but I ended up doing so.Me and my friend were out getting some candy on Halloween, and we heard a bunch of noise up at this one house. C said that his friend J was having a party, and said we should go up there. I was hesitant at first, I didn't know any of his friends except J (who I didn't particularly like) - but ended up going anyways. When we arrived, this kid was crying about his dad having a heart attack, there was pretty much a big scene of people there, and he looked up and told me to cut my hair. His friend was this tall guy who I do not know (I live about an hour away from these guys, as I was just visiting C for the weekend) - regardless, he basically asked me how old I was, I told him 16, and he then said that that J's parents don't care if anyone drinks. It's all down in the basement he said. Me and C not having anything else constructive to do for the evening, headed for the basement. As soon as I got there, I saw a very drunk girl and a very drunk guy on a mattress laughing. There was also a guy who was passed out on the couch with a bucket underneath his head, another girl on another couch adjacent him being consoled as she got very, very sick in a bucket as well. I looked on the table and saw a large bottle of Canadian Club. I didn't really want to drink any at the moment, so I sat in the chair by the guy that was passed out. C left somewhere at this time. I'm kinda a quiet person, so I didn't talk to anyone. I finally got the nerve to go up and pour a shot of Canadian Club so people wouldn't think I'm a square. I kinda sat there dazed before drinking it, and one guy asks me multiple times if I was high. Which I was not. So I took my first sip of it, boy did it taste awful. But I continued to baby it until it was finished. I felt warm. Not buzzed at all. Just warm. I soon got up and poured another one - just so people won't think I'm square.  I think I started going into denial at around the third shot - 'I'm only drinking it because they'll make fun of me if I don't' - I wanted to get plastered. So this time around, I get up for my 4th shot, and the drunk guy I saw on the mattress came down from upstairs and gave me a happy hello by asking me to play a game with him. It consisted of drinking a shot of Whiskey, then taking a shot of coke (Coca Cola, not cocaine). Then whiskey, then coke, etc. At about this time, something came over me, he kept on pouring shots, I kept on drinking them. They didn't taste nearly as awful at this point, and plus, I was drinking some coke to chase the taste that I could *barely* taste, so why not drink a bunch more? I seriously drank around 20 - 25 shots that night. Maybe 30. Soon after that guy left me, so astounded at how many shots I had just dranken, that he called me a 'tank, I was really drunk. All I remember is laughing, slurred speech, running outside looking for C, putting on a really old New years Eve hat. . .and having a mercy fight with a Rugby player, who almost broke my hand. Of course, at the time I couldn't feel anything really.Then I went to sit down in the chair again. And I felt like I was going into a deep sleep. I remember waking my eyes up a bit and seeing some weird gothic people coming in, but not much else. C loves to tell me what I did at the party. Every time I see him, he'll give me a new detail of what happened on that night.  I have brief recollection of what happened, but some of it people have to tell me because I honestly don't remember:I was running around, screaming. Frequently taking more shots. My friend C says 'CALM DOWN, JON!' (my nicknames Jon) - and he would push me on the chair, and I'd fall over. And then I would get up for some more shots. C would take one that I was about to drink, and magically, I'd pull one from out from my other hand and drink it. Another time I spit the entire shot all over him. He then pushed me on the chair again. Then there's the window. . I was sitting on this mattress, and there was a window near it. And I guess I was REALLY bugging this sober Rugby player, and he wanted to kick my ass, so I hit him, and jumped out the window, flailing around uncontrollably. Running around a tree screaming. C tells me ALL the adults, and practically all the kids were staring at me as I did this, eventually falling down into someone else’s yard. They would drag me back to J's yard just so the neighbours didn't get pissed.I think by this point, I was in a ditch or something, and vomiting, and people had to bring me in the house again. C told me I grabbed some chicks tit, and actually held onto it a bit before she realized who was grabbing it. She accused the guy standing behind her if he did it, and he said no. I also heard I was playing with J's little sister (whos 11 I think) and her friends. Eventually, they were just jumping on me as I lay there passed out. I'm probably missing a lot of details, but I can't remember anything. All the stuff I'm telling you past the sitting down on the chair and feeling like slipping in a coma. I do not remember doing. It's like another person did that pretty much. But it's so strange that I did that, because when I was on the chair, I felt like I wanted to sleep, and go into a coma of sorts. But I suppose I got right up and went insane after that.I woke up on the couch of C's living room. There was a bucket underneath my mouth. I got up, surveyed my surroundings, and for some reason, went to sleep in his little brother’s room. I got up about an hour later, and went to the bathroom. I didn't remember leaving J's, or when I went to sleep at all. When I saw my self in the mirror I was in awe. I looked like complete shit. Massive puke stains on my shirt, little strand of it in my hair, heck, probably even on my face. I through off my clothes and jumped in the shower immediately. I later learned that I passed out on the chair, pissed my pants, and J and his mom had to drive me home to C's. I was fucking SHIVERING on the floor of C's kitchen. Shivering, vomiting. C's mom stayed up till 5am with me to make sure I didn't choke on my own puke. I'm pretty grateful. The hangover was hell. Not really that bad, but pretty bad. And it hit my friend C even worse (apparently, he had drank a lot too, but right after I lost it) - he made a huge whole in the dry wall from punching it. Yet, this experience was kinda fun. Mostly stupid though. I didn't know what I was doing when I took those shots, I just kept on taking as many as possible. I basically stick to weed now, it tastes hella good, and I love smoking. But I have an occasional shot here and there. Me and my friends went camping.  We figured to make it a little more comical we'd bring along a handle of Jack Daniel's.  So we get the fire roasting, and enjoy some hotdogs over the camp fire.  Then we break out the Jack.  I had never drank before.  So my friend said its pretty easy to mix with Cherry Coke.  So we proceded to do about a shot of Jack for ever 10 oz of Cherry Coke.  I drank 3 of those.  Each one had a little more alcohol in than the rest.  Then I took 2 straight shots, just for the experience.  So I figured about 6 drinks total.  This was over about a 2 hour time period, and with food in the stomach.  Now I felt weird.  I felt fuzzy, and just plain dumb.  It basically mimicked sleep deprivation I thought.  Just a plain careless, dumb, inhibiting feeling.  So we went to bed, and upon waking up I felt like crap.  I had about 20oz of water before I went to bed to make sure I wasn't so dehydrated.  I woke up with a weird headache.  Then I puked about 10 minutes later.  I figured whatever... just remnants left over I'll be fine.  So I take some water to get some fluid in my system.  I puked again.  I tried different things to make me stop puking but nothing would stop it.  I ended up puking about 6 times.  It was horrible.  I mean I barely had anything to drink based on the amount of time I took it in.  I don't plan on drinking anytime soon ever again.  I don't know what I did wrong, cause I've seen guys smaller than me do 6 shots within 15 minutes and wake up just fine.  I just figure maybe my hangovers will be really bad.  It was a horrible experience though, not something I would try again in the near future thats for sure.     My freind M and I were hanging out on weekend when I asked my mom if he could spend the night at my house.  At first she said no, like she usually does, but after some begging and pleading she said he could stay.  I had rented Bill and Ted's Bogus Journey a few nights before because I thought it looked pretty funny.  I decided that we were going to watch it that night against my freinds will.  Around 10 p.m. my parents were asleep so we went down the cellar and opened up the box of liquor on the shelf.  The beauty of the situation was; my parents always go to bed early, the liquor was down the cellar and they were upstairs, they haven't touched the box in years (my mom bought all the stuff a few years ago when she and her sisters went to Jamacia and got hammered every night), and they'll never open it again because they only drink beer.  We took out a bottle of some Absolut vodka and poured it in some glasses of Rasberry Ginger Ale.  I never really measured how much I put in it, but it was probably somehwere between 2 to 4 shots worth.  My freind is a pansy and probably put 1/4 of a shot and complained about how awful it tasted.  At this time and I had drank a few times before, but never really got drunk, just slightly buzzed.  After I poured in the vodka I stirred the mix with my finger and downed it real fast.  M and I went upstairs after we had finished and popped in Bill and Ted.  About 10 minutes after the movie started my whole body felt real warm.  It was one of the best things I have ever felt in my whole entire life.  I started to get real giggly and laughed at everything in the entire movie, while my freind looked at me wondering how I saw anyhting in Bill and Ted. I laughed at everything, even when they air guitared I thought it was the funniest thing I had ever seen.  I had to take a piss so I tried to get up.  It took be about three tries to lift myself off the couch.  When I made my way to the bathroom I was stumbling everywhere.  I used every chair in the house as support and was making quite a riot.  When I came back M said he was sick of the movie so we stopped it and went to the basement. I slowly walked down the stairs so I didn't kill myself.  We sat around in the cellar for awhile and I felt pretty tired.  I went over to M, ready to ask him if he wanted to go to bed.  What I said instead was, 'Do you wanna... like... uhh...'  and I started laughing uncontrollably at how stupid I sounded.  I went over to turn off the light and hit about three different things on my way to and from the switch.  I went to bed feeling better than I ever had in my entire life.  I woke up the next morning with no hangover or sickness at all.  We forgot to cover up our evidence, so we took the vodka bottle and filled it up with as much water as we had taken.  I shook it around and it looked fine, so I put it back in the box.  I also noticed that I had made a huge mess at the light switch area so I cleaned that up as well.  M told me that I was a complete mess last night, but I just laughed.  I said it was the best thing I had ever done.  I still drink ocasionally, but it is never as good as my first time being hammered. It was the end of term, and a generally very happy occasion for myself and a bunch of friends a little while ago. We had three weeks of partying until school started up again and we intended to use it to the fullest. The first little experiment we embarked on, and the only one I'm going to talk about here, was one that involved quite a bit of alcohol at one of my friend's places very late at night.This was the first time I've got truly wasted. I've been slightly drunk before, but never quite this drunk.The day term broke up we all headed over to his place by bus to have a bit of fun, see some movies, but not before considering the fact that we believed it was necessary for us to all get wasted. Thus, we went out and bought a bottle of Butterscotch Schnapps, and hid it in my bag.After arriving at his place and eating quite a bit of food, we proceeded to sample the Schnapps (before the movie) in very small quantities. While it had that comforting, burning sensation in the back of my throat like a lot of liquor it tasted like crap - personally, I prefer Whisky, but no matter. We weren't particularly fussy about the taste. We then went down (while my friends parents were out) to his cellar to inspect his stash - he had a box of Vodka 'Ruski's' - a mix of about 7-8% vodka and then lemon juice etc. and another box of Bacardi Breezers (again, about 7% rum and the rest watermelon flavoured water or something.) He also had copious amounts of reasonably light beer, about 4% alcohol, and a lot of liqueur, one kiwi fruit flavoured, which myself and another friend (who also got wasted) tried later without our host's knowing. He also had straight vodka and some whiskey in a cabinet elsewhere, that we also had. Well, I had.Anyway, at that point we just relaxed, watched some tv, played some video games, all in anticipation of the fun that was to be. So, around 7:00 or so, I consumed (along with most of my friends - there were 7 of us, only 3 of us got pissed) a Bacardi Breezer (we had about 36 or so) and then took another one to drink on the way to the movies. We rocked up at the theater at about 7:45, starting to just feel the first effects of the alcohol - a bit lightheaded, generally pretty happy, joking a bit, but still I was very conscious of my surroundings - it's strange that, when I'm drunk, I can still manage to take in everything with a part of my brain, but the other half just wants to pass out.Unfortunately, the movie we wanted to see (can't remember what it was) was sold out - thus, we bought tickets for the 9:45 session and walked back to his place (only about a 5 minute walk) to chill out a bit more. At around 8:30 I (and a few others) had a Ruski. They were quite nice, a good deal better than the watermelon Bacardis. I was feeling slightly impaired now, probably due to my relatively low weight. I wasn't falling over and could still feel straight, but I occasionally laughed at inappropriate times.Then the fun started. We left for the movies at 9:20 (planning to just hang out a bit before the movie started) and myself and a few friends ended up chasing our other three friends who had run off to do god knows what without us.We then came across four incredibly drunk young girls, who said they wanted to 'thrash' us, and professed that they were _sure_ they knew us. It was sort sad, really. We knew the same thing would happen to us if we drank too much - but of course, that didn't deter us in the slightest.Unfortunately, the night then turned ugly as one of my friends (the host, in fact) was bashed by some Maori guy (who was, I later found out, considerably drunk) and was left with a split lip and a bleeding nose. After he cleaned up, we watched the movie. Now like I've said, I'm not the strongest of fellows when it comes to alcohol tolerance, and while I tried to put on a macho face and say I couldn't feel anything, the truth was I could. Watching the movie was an almost surreal experience; I heard the jokes, but didn't laugh because a) they were bad and b) I wasn't really there. I was sort of floating above, my head bobbing from side to side, observing everthing around me in a wierd kind of way, smiling. Only on the way back to his house at about 11:00 did I start laughing uncontrollably.Then we got back. I then consumed approximately two more Bacardi breezers and another Ruski (roughly 11:30 now) and was starting to feel the effects even more. This was when my walking was starting to get a little shaky, and I was swaying all over the place. If I sat down, I had trouble getting back up again, and I had this constant desire to sit down and rest. I downloaded a few songs on my friends computer and listening to them was incredibly wierd. I could hear them, but yet again, I couldn't really respond, because I was in this sort of far off drunken land, floating above myself, not quite seeing everything or everyone. I can remember someone started laughing at me when I fell over, and I started laughing back (this was, I believe, the other guy that got pissed) and we both fell over and started laughing again. I couldn't really see him properly, anyway.What followed was a rather hazy incident I can't remember very well where I and the other guy that was pissed (call him B) ran outside, for some reason. The host caught us, pushed me over and I grazed my arm and my knee. I can't remember feeling any pain, though.We finished off the Schnapps (sip, sip pass) and then we were pretty drunk (about 12:00.) We went in source of more alcohol and found the vodka and kiwi liqueur we had seen earlier. After making a disgusting cocktail and downing that, we sat down (I nearly passed out) and started watching a movie. That was REALLY wierd. I was lying down, staring at the ceiling, and it almost seemed as though it was collapsing, everything was closing in - and then my friend, I can remember, said 'make sure you don't lie on your back...' and then I finished by saying 'so I don't choke on my own vomit.' It seemed as though as inebriated as I was, I could still think properly, which I pondered for a moment before lying back, stretching out and taking full advantage of this wonderful feeling.We then played a drinking game with some beer - whereupon I wrecked the entire thing with saying 'yeah, that was worth the whole bottle' and downing that. That was my last sip of alcohol the night. (about 12:45 or so) At this point I was really out of it, I mean completely off the wall. I stumbled upstairs, making loud noises and tripping over on every second stair, until I got to a bedroom. Another friend who was fairly intoxicated then punched a whole in a punching bag with a short sword (don't ask me WHERE that came from) and I was feeling a little scared then. I was drunk, but I had sense enough to tell him to put it down.Then I started really concentrating on the euphoria. I sat back, closed my eyes and tried to visualize various things. Floating on clouds, flying, falling. For a moment I wasn't in my body, I was soaring, it was amazing.At about 1:00 in the morning, I passed out on a couch downstairs.I woke up in the morning at about 11:00 feeling and looking really, really bad. I had some scrambled eggs (bad idea) and then decided it was time to go home. I could still feel some of the effects and I had a bit of a headache. Catching the bus was sort of strange because I was still a bit out of it, and people looked at me in a wierd way. And then, possibly the worst thing that could have possibly happened - happened. I threw up ON THE BUS. This was perhaps the single most embarassing experience in my life, especially because I threw up on my bag.After walking around a bit and finding a toilet to clean myself up, I went home and slept most of the day.In short:I had a great experience, overall, but it was ruined by the morning's hangover. Next time I do this, it'll be in moderation and most definitely NOT until I'm totally intoxicated. As usual, I began my weekend meeting up with my best friend M to go get some alcohol from our hook-up. Everything went as planned as I bought 1/5 of my favorite vodka and was set for a fun night of drinking. My friend S called me and said she knew of a crazy party that was nearby and wanted me to come along. We followed her to the party which looked like something out of a teen movie with a mass of cars parked on the street and drunk kids stumbling around. I saw many of my old friends’ cars and saw cars of people I despise, so I was excited for whatever was gonna happen. As we made it to the house I said hello to a bunch of my friends and started drinking straight from my vodka bottle VERY quickly. It seemed like after 5 minutes I was already drunk and was surprised I could get drunk that fast. Usually I like to take shots as a way to monitor my drinking, but tonight I decided to be stupid and drink from the bottle straight. My friend M and I were having a blast and couldn’t believe the mass of people that were at the party with no cops around. I spoke to early...About an hour into the party somebody yells 'cops!' and everybody starts fleeing away from the house(which is really stupid) and I start running through the woods with them. After running through a creek, hiding in three random bushes by people’s house, my friend M called and told me to walk down the street and get to his car. Still with the vodka in my hand, I run into the street only to find the cop sitting at the end of it with his lights turned off. Scared shitless, I ran to the backyard of the house across from me and jumped over the fence only to fall down head first (OUCH!). As I walked around, I found the street and made it to my friend’s car. We sped off to a nearby fast food place and told a bunch of other people to come there. At this point I felt drunker than I've ever had before. After hanging at the fast food place for awhile, we got bored and my friend dropped me off at the lake near my house. Right after leaving the car, I began to throw up violently and felt like shit. For about 10 minutes I sat there puking and puking. How would I ever get home like this? I walked inside my house without my dad thinking anything was up and ran up to my bedroom to try to sleep it off. I started throwing up all over my room and couldn’t believe how sick I felt. Suddenly I woke up feeling still drunk and very hung-over. As I lay in my bed, I began feeling extremely annoyed by anything I heard, saw, smelled, or sensed. Every negative thought ran through my head and lead to a new one which began to make me sicker. Lying in my bed my stomach felt like it was going to explode soon, so I ran to the bathroom and forced myself to puke by sticking my finger down my throat. For the next 6 hours of hell I kept lying down, then getting up and forcing myself to puke. My parents knew I was sick but didn’t know it was alcohol sickness until they found my bottle. They weren’t too mad because I made the promise to myself and them I would never drink again. Some people say that and never live up to their promise but I never want to feel like that again. For now I will stick to the harmless plant marijuana and know I will never drink again. It was an april saturday much like any other saturday, full of life and thoughts of the night ahead of me. I was hanging out with a friend whose dad was visiting from Vancouver. His dad was an alcoholic, but he only drank wine or beer. He liked the buzz while my mindstate at the time was, I just wanna get as fucked up as I can. Anyways it was my friend heathers birthday and me and my buddy were invited. We went into town at 2:00 pm with my friend's dad to get some drink. I wanted to start drinking right away til late night so I figured I'd get a 40 pounder of wieser's whiskey.  Well I start drinking a bit mixed in with a slurpee I bought at seven eleven. Then I went to the local high school cause apparently some big band concert was going on and concert bands from all over British Columbia would be there. The reason we went was not too listen to band dorks toot there horns it was to scope for any outta town hotties. Well ill tell ya there weren’t too many. During the day I paced the drinking nice and at 9ish I got to heathers house. Mostly girls were there and I was having a blast just talking and enjoying the company. By then I had probably finished 2/3 of the bottle and was quite drunk, not over the line, but nicely hosed. Then one of my other friends that was there dared me to chug the rest of it. Being hosed and confident I didn't take the challenge seriously. I slammed about 12 shots of liquor in one hit. I was fine for about 5 minutes then I vaguely remember taking huge stumbles 10 feet in either direction and walking into a tree. I fell over and heather was trying to get me to walk. I couldn’t my body felt like it weighed a thousand pounds. After that I remember involuntarily passing out, I couldn’t hold my eyes open. It was really strange cause it felt like I was in a coma or something cause I could still hear. I remember girls screaming at me telling me to wake up and crying and my buddy B yelling 'hes gonna die'. I have no recollection of anything after that and I woke up the next morning in a chair on my lawn, covered in vomit.I was still so messed, I had to get my dad help me to the kitchen to get water. It was like a child learning to walk or someone who had got both his legs broken taking his first step after recovery. I drank some water and immediately puked it back up. I couldn't get anything to stay down til about 6:00 pm. It was the most absolutely horrible hangover I had ever suffered. And I scared all my friends so bad and ruined heather's party, that’s probably the worst part. I was stuck at home on a friday night and I figured I'd make the best of it and have a little party with myself.  I looked around the house and located a bottle of Irish Cream (60 proof).  I poured myself a tall glass full with the intentions of chugging it.  However I got sidetracked and went looking for a gram of regs I had left over from a session with my best friend the day before. I found the marijuana and surveyed that I didnt have anything at hand to smoke out of because I lent my bowl to a friend of mine.  So I grabbed my pack of cigarettes and began to pinch out about half of the tobacco in 5 cigarettes.  I later filled the half empty cigarettes with the finely ground marijuana and smoked them throughout the evening, about 8-11.  At 11pm I drank the liquor and smoked a cigarette and was ready to sit back and relax.  The mood was so lifted and despite being stranded alone at home, I was having a blast of a time.  This isnt such an extraodinary event, im sure many people do things similar to this.  I do it whenever I have the necessary ingredients and im home alone or bored.  As simple as it may seem, these three substances when used together have such a perfect harmony.  Whatever the chemical reasons may be, at the same time, all three create an ideal euphoria.I sat back and relaxed as all of my worries drifted away and I turned on the television so I could drift off into whatever movie I began to watch.  I smoked a few more of these very strong cuban cigarettes I had left over from a recent trip to mexico.  Each time I smoked I got the smallest, most perfect lift back into my state of bliss.  All in all, what posed to be a boring and dull night turned into what couldnt have any more fun. I'll try to make this report as short as possible, mainly because I don't enjoy writing too much. It started out on a Friday night, and I was visiting my hometown on vacation. I was with my best friend Chelsea, and made plans to go to our 'friend' Jason's house to drink. We told her parents we were simply going to go shopping at the mall and be back by nine, for her parents are quit strict, and by this time it was already around 6. We waited for Jason at the mall to pick us up, which consumed enough of our short time. We finally arrived to his place, and he poured us some drinks of straight whiskey. Then, I had never had a hangover or felt sick after drinking. I proceeded to drink, rather fast, consuming about 3 tall glasses of the whiskey. By then, I was pretty out of it. The last moment I remember was when I grabbed a bottle of red wine from Jason and had a few swigs from it. It all went down hill from there... Apparently I stumbled my way to Jason's room, and fell immediately to his bed. He came to see how I was doing, and I told him I was going to puke. He quickly ran to the bathroom to get a garbage, but I had already thrown up all over his 600 dollar bed, which was actually his grandpa's. Furiously, he brought me to the bathroom. By then I had passed out, and was laying on the cold floor. I could hear Chelsea crying and telling to me get up, but I simply couldn't, I just couldn't move! She proceeded in attempting to pick me up, but I came crashing head first onto the bathtub. I was covered in throwup, as well as the bathroom floor and carpet. By then my 'friend' Jason was fed up, and started screaming horrible things to Chelsea, and finally kicking us out of his house. He realized there was no way Chelsea could carry me, so he helped carry me and got a cab (which he payed for with the money he stole from my purse, around $70).While in the cab, Chelsea struggled putting my filthy clothes back on. We arrived back at the mall, where Chelsea called her parents and told them to pick us up (I was still passed out). They finally arrived, and freaked out when they saw me. They rushed home and immediately called an ambulance (which I thought was totally unnecessary when I first was told). Chelsea was still crying haaard; my lips by then had turned blue, my face completely white, she thought I was dying, or even dead! The paramedics placed me on the floor, and squeezed verrrry hard somewhere on my shoulder, which for a split second brought me back screaming and telling them to stop, then I was gone again. As I opened my eyes, I realized I was in a hospital, laying on a bed. I looked around the room to find Chelsea, her parents, and my brothers staring at me, in disappointment. I was still rather drunk then, and very confused. I was crying hysterically, laying in my own vomit, asking myself soo many questions. I continuously kept crying out my oldest brother's name, I didn't want to be alone. I looked at the clock, it read 3am. Shiit, I passed out for 6 hours.There's no feeling I could describe the way I felt about myself. I was ashamed of myself. I never thought shit like this could happen to me, I'd never had any problems drinking. I was very anxious to leave this damn hospital, but I was told to take a piss test. Apparently when I was still passed out, Chelsea freaked and told them some bullshit story which made it sound like I was drugged. I came clean and told the truth though.Well that night I learned alot. I remember constantly telling myself that I'd NEVER drink again. A couple weeks later there I  was, getting shit-faced at a party. But I never touched whiskey again! It scares me though, knowing I could have easily died, my BAC was .44 ! I felt hung over for the next 2 days too, throwing up bile because I had nothing left in my stomach, which messed up my throat for a while. I drank waaaaay too fast that night and learnt the hard way.  Have fun but be careful!!Ooh yeah, the ambulance ride costed me $500 :S 3:23 PM- Parachute ~2 grams of super-grade kratom powder. ( 1.5 tsp)+0:14 - Ate caffeine tablet containing ~ 90 mg caffeine. Headspace also slightly altered- possibly placebo.+0:35 - Noticable relaxed buzz, very tired. Taking longer for effect, probably because it was taken on a full stomach. Cognitive impairment also noticable- its a lot tougher to type.+1:10 - Not nearly as tired, probably because of caffeine, kratom's effects are still very subtle, but pleasant. Feels almost like the beginning of a psilocybin trip. +1:35  - Frustrated by subtlety of effects, I consume an additional 4 grams, parachuted. According to erowid, in addition to my initial dose this should yield strong effects.+1:55 - Noticable strenghtening of effects, very pleasant and opiate-like. Appetite is suppressed. Perceptual alterations very similar to onset of psychadelic drugs.+2:27 - Effects continue to strengthen, my skin feels warmer than usual and I am sweating more than i usually do. Lack of motivation. I decide to enjoy a cold beer, which goes down exceptionally well.+2:40 - At this point it feels like a mix between a tranquilzer and a painkiller - not much euphoria, but i am very calm and content to do nothing except admire the beauty of nature (or the TV screen). I think it's time for some ganja.+2:57 -I smoked a fat cigarette containing very high-potency cannabis, red poppy, blue lotus, chamomile, and sage. I was extremely high after finishing, and i still am. The kratom, and the other herbs to a lesser degree, definately enhanced the cannabis high; it was much, much more euphoric and there was none of the paranoia that is usually present. Interestingly, I am not tired at all; i am awake and alert yet tranquilized at the same time. A very pleasant feeling.+4:37 - Effects have gradually faded to a strong sense of relaxation as the marijuana wore off. A few more beers adds to the effect. The effects faded away completely within a couple hours. Overall, I believe Kratom to be an interesting recreational drug; it certainly enhances the effects of marijuana, and by itself provides a relaxing, tranquilizing high. I would recommend it wo anyone seeking to end an opiate or benzodiazepine addiction, or enyone who wants to experience a very unique and natural high. Last night, I had a bad reaction to pot and beer. I have always considered mixing pot and beer to be disorienting, nauseating, and usually pretty sedating, depending on dose. I have had experience with pot for about 4 years, varying from a once-in-a-while smoker to an almost everyday smoker. I am less experienced with alcohol because I never really desired to drink much, only socially on occasion. The night was the fourth of July, and I was at my friends house. I had purchased four 6-packs of some pounders of beer. It was my friend, W, and my friend's brother M. I was in a happy state of mind, it was Independence Day and we had all experienced some very good fireworks. I was talkative and relaxed. I had just finished five beers (80 ounces) in two hours. I was feeling really good, just slightly sick to my stomach. My friend W goes inside while I stay on the porch talking with his brother. Then, my friend brings out a packed bowl, of what looked like mid-grade pot. I had not smoked in about a week, so I was quite excited to get high again. I knew from past experience that drinking and smoking pot didn't go together too well, but I figured I would just quit drinking if I felt too sick.We passed the bowl around. We got about 3 hits each. I was staring to feel the effects of the pot coming on, unusually intense. I felt like I wasn't getting enough oxygen to my brain. I felt a heavy feeling all over. I was still feeling good though. Soon after we smoked the bowl we decided to go inside. When I got up, I felt a huge head rush, then my memory skips to me being on the floor with my vision slowly piecing back together, right inside the doorway. I had fallen into some chairs and hit the floor pretty hard. I came to and felt the head rush feeling subsiding. M and W were kinda laughing at me. I did not really feel that messed up to be falling down. I was very surprised to have awakened on the floor. I was only laying there a few seconds I was later told.So, I got up and said, wow, I don't feel good. As soon as I stood up I got that intense head rush feeling again. I staggered toward the bathroom, which was about 10 feet away from where I had gotten up. My memory once again skips to me being halfway in the bathtub. I had fallen out cold, again. The head rush feeling subsiding slowly. M and W were once again there, and they tried to help me up. I didn't really feel nauseated anymore, just a toxic feeling was flowing through me. I still felt the effects of both the alcohol and pot strongly.I once again got up and started walking again. I was headed for the living room which was down the hall about 20 feet. I said I could make it there without help. I didn't feel too messed up, I could think normal, but did feel a little unbalanced. The head rush hit me once again. I then wake up again on the floor. M and W ask if I am ok, and I nod, being kind of embarrassed and also surprised that I was fainting. I have never fainted or passed out like that before. They pick me up by my arms and help me into the living room. I sit down, realizing I cannot stand up without getting that terrible head rush. I do not know if this head rush was caused by too much or too little blood going to my brain, but I can guess that my blood pressure was low and my pulse rate was high. I could feel my heart beating very fast. I was feeling much better sitting down. M and W kind of thought it was funny. They told me that when I had collapsed those three times, I 'woke up' seconds later. I assume since I was laying down, from falling down, the blood to my brain returned to normal, and I would regain consciousness.I started to come down off of the peak of the pot about twenty minutes later, and then I attempted walking again and I was fine. I started to feel some sharp pain on my chin, nose and elbows a little later. I started to get more sober, and I didn't feel the desire to sleep, so I stayed up a while longer. We smoked some more a little later, but I didn't touch any more beer that night. I am very surprised with what happened. I don't believe I drank too much, or smoked too much, it was the combination of the two that did this. I would like to note that I was on the third story of an apartment building, and if I had passed out on the porch I could have fallen. I think it is very scary that I had collapsed three times from standing up. I didn't just fall down, I lost consciousness, causing me to fall down, obviously. I use extreme caution with combining these two drugs. I think they together negatively affect my vital signs, like blood pressure and heart rate. I am very experienced with altered mind states and would have never thought that I could pass out from two low-medium doses of pot and alcohol. The week before my experience I was in the pub talking a friend who had supplied me with Salvia before. He said he might be able to get hold of some mushrooms from the season previous, and asked me if I was interested. I hadn’t taken mushrooms before and had only had a mild LSD trip a few months previous. I really wanted to trip again though so I told him I would be back next week with the money.I got the pub around 7 and started drinking. My alcohol tolerance is pretty low, so it wasn’t long before I was drunk. Salvia guy turned up with my mushrooms not long after and sold me fifty liberty caps which were ground up. They were in a plastic zip bag and I slowly started to eat them. Around twenty minutes later I started to feel like I was rising into a new world. This world didn’t exist in the present the past or the future but existed somewhere. I carried on drinking while I rose up to meet this new world.Someone walked over and sat between me and Salvia guy which made me angry, I couldn’t understand how they could do such a thing. I told them to sit away from me and my co-pilot. I was starting to come up nicely and felt like I had joined the world now so I decided to leave. On the way out I told the bouncer I loved him. He said, ‘Oh, drunk again are we?’ which made me laugh. As I began walking home I felt really good, I could feel a warm buzz inside. It wasn’t as intense as MDMA, but somehow nicer.As I walked some more I began feeling content with everything, I wanted to find friends and chat to them about what I felt. Everything was ok. I took a piss in the middle of the street, It didn’t bother me, and I couldn’t understand how anyone else could be bothered by it either. I walked up to a friends flat and knocked the door, no answer, so I started making my way home.On my way home I was just loving the feeling of warmth and understanding. I decided to take a detour through some woods, the darkness didn’t bother me as I was in love. In the woods I began thinking about my life, how things weren’t so bad and how the future was going to be so bright. I decided to change a lot of things about me and the way I thought about others. I felt like some sort of guru who knew the secrets of the universe. When I was coming out of the woods questions came into my head, which I had the answer or solution to straight away. I kept firing questions at myself and answering them with total ease. I must have asked myself dozens of complex questions in the time it took me to walk twenty-five meters.Once out of the darkness of the wood and back onto the street I was filled with a sense of nothing. I couldn’t be bothered to think, just relax in the feeling of love. I managed to get home and to my room where I lay out on my bed and listened to Sgt. Pepper’s. I lay staring at nothing listening to the music. The songs spoke of the place I was in which felt good. After the album ended I tried to sleep. I don't know how long it was before I slept, ten minutes or three hours. I woke up the next morning quite hazy and not remembering much.The experience taught me how to improve myself and how to treat others. This lasted for many months, but has worn off. I feel like I need another mushrooms trip to bring back the things I’ve now lost. This is my story. Never in a million years did I think I would end up here, but I did. I guess it started when I was 13. People at school would talk about ‘getting high’ and how cool it was, and me, the loser, wanted to fit in. I didn’t really understand what alcohol and drugs were, or what they did to you, I just knew that if you did them, you were cool. So at the age of 13 I was at my grandma’s house and I stole some cigarettes from my mom to smoke, took a couple beers and drank them. At first I didn’t really know what to expect, I just felt a little weird. I continued to smoke cigarettes and drink a little here and there.Then one day, I was sleeping over at my friends house and his brother had some really good weed. I smoked for the first time that night. I got so high all I could do was laugh. It was amazing. So from then on I would come over every weekend to smoke weed with his brother. Now at this time, I am still a loser and I wanted to fit in. I told everyone at school I was doing heroin and ecstasy and every other drug under the sun and of course they didn’t believe me, so I was even more of a loser. But, I didn’t just say it to be cool, I really wanted to do all of these drugs, Heroin especially because it was the hardest of all. I couldn’t ever find a connection to these drugs so I continued to smoke weed on the weekends and drink very occasionally.Well, his brother started selling weed, and got caught with a pipe at school, so he gave me 3 1/2 ounces to sell for him. Now, I was the shit. I started to sell weed and everybody bought off of me. I thought I was so cool. Now I was smoking every night, every morning before school, and every day after school with my friends. I went through a period were I pretended to be suicidal and abused cough medicine for a high. After being hospitalized several times, I gave up. Then I sort of just stopped hanging out with people and doing drugs all together.Then my mom sent me away to Christian summer camp. I met somebody with a car that wanted to hang out with me and she introduced me to a lot of people. I started dating a pot head and together we bought weed. My hook-up just so happened to be a female that was 4 years older than me, so I dumped my girlfriend for her. Me and her smoked weed every single day, and at least once a week I would party with her friends and get drunk while I smoked weed.Well, eventually I wanted to do something else. I started stealing prescription pain killers from my grandma, from my girlfriend’s parents, or anybody else that had them. So I would still smoke weed everyday, drink more often, then I met someone who sold cocaine. The first couple times I bought it I got ripped off, but then I met someone who had some very strong coke cut with ether. This really kicked in my addiction. I was stealing jewelry from my mom, pawning everything I owned, stealing large amounts of money from people in my neighborhood, and ripping people off to get my coke every single day, while still smoking weed and popping pain pills. I stopped doing coke after being confronted about the missing jewelry, and then I began to drink every single night. My mom started calling the cops on me for coming home trashed to the point that I couldn’t walk.I accumulated 7 charges of Unlawful Consumption of Alcohol by a Minor in the end. I started hanging out with people when my girlfriend was at work and ended up hanging around some people that did heroin. I was very interested in this, so I took up the opportunity. I paid people to drive into the city to pick me up some dope. I only bought a few bags at a time, after realizing that my bags were being cut in half, I took it upon myself to get my dope. I met a girl who was an old user who had just started using again after rehab, and she would drive me up to the city and I bought a couple bags at a time and that was the first time I truly got high on heroin.Now keep in mind this whole time I am drinking daily, smoking weed all day everyday, popping pain pills when I could get my hands on them, running away (for the night) with my mom’s best friend to go out drinking and ended up buying crack, hiding the heroin from my girlfriend, who only smoked pot (did not even drink, but used to use coke with me). Then one day I talked my girlfriend into doing heroin. She did it and liked it, so I talked her into it again. And again. I started out once a week (buying a few bags), then once a week buying a jab (14 bags or $100) then to buying a jab twice a week, then buying a jab every three days, then almost every other day.I was always drunk when I wasn’t high on heroin, still smoking weed constantly and popping Vicodin, Percocet, Oxycontin, MS contin, and dihydrocodeine. I went from sniffing my heroin to shooting it up. I would completely disregard anything my girlfriend said about quitting the heroin and drinking. And the whole time I didn’t see a thing wrong with it. Now at this point I am just in a constant state of oblivion. My 7 charges of unlawful consumption caught up with me and I ended up on probation. My mom had suspected I was using heroin (my friend overdosed on it in my driveway and I called my stepdad, a recovering heroin addict, to ask him what to do, and we ended up driving him to the hospital) and part of my probation was to undergo a drug and alcohol evaluation.Well, I was filling out paper work at the clinic and my nose started bleeding, I was urine tested and tested positive for heroin, and when the counselor told me I needed inpatient treatment, I screamed at her and walked out. Well, I continued to use heroin and alcohol until the day I was admitted into rehab. I spent 45 days in a treatment facility, and three days after being released I was getting high again. It started once a week, then on weekends, then everyday again. I failed 5 probation drug drops and was put in jail for 17 days, where the only way I could get out without going back in to treatment for 6 months was to agree to do the Drug Court Program.If I fail one drop I am detained, put in jail, then transferred into rehab. I am completely miserable, I obsess everyday about getting my fix, I thought this lifestyle was so glamorous, and it is, until you get caught, and you will get caught. It might take years. Let me tell you, forced sobriety is the most horrible thing in the world. Sometimes I just want to give up, but I am doing this at least for 6 more months, if not more. I would stick with weed and occasional booze, because it’s not too hard to kick those, but once I touched the harder drugs (coke and heroin) I never forgot that wonderful euphoria, nothing in the whole world feels that good, I will never get that high naturally, only chemically, it will destroy me.I know I will use cocaine and heroin again, because I love that feeling. It is incredible.I can’t believe this actually happened to me. I thought it was what I wanted, no, if I could go back, I would have never touched those drugs, so I would have never had to think about it, or obsess over it. I am so miserable today. But this is a consequence of my actions. Just remember, the lucky ones are the ones that OD and die, the ones who don’t get to live miserably for the rest of their lives because they will never forget what they had. My bro and I were always after whatever we could get. The MS Contins and oxy's were getting way to expensive and we were always after real H but could never find it. My bro started a new job about 3 months ago and quickly found himself immersed in the drug culture. Sure enough, we found a guy who had the real deal. Last saturday we started it out nice with 20mg's valium mixed with 4mg's xanax and just drinkin beer all day. We were feeing wonderful and stupid too. We were getting bored with the benzo buzz We decided we needed the extra boost of an opiate, the real thing would be perfect we thought.He called The Man, the bundle was purchased, we split it 5 bags a piece and we immediately started snorting away - all the while we kept this a secret from our wives. The Man supposedly told my bro that this was some very powerful high quality stuff - and his bags were quite generous to boot. I have always been very cautious about my intake so I was snorting 1/4 a bag at a time, giving it some time then go back later for another line, etc. The Man was right about the quality - the euphoria was breathtaking and absolutely wonderful - well worth every penny - best I ever had.I was not paying much attention to my bro who had snorted the stuff before so I figured he knew his dosing. He was in and out of the bathroom quite a bit. We were still drinking moderately and we popped a couple more valiums and xan's. I honestly don't know how many he had but it wasn't many that I saw - just a couple.Well, everything was fine we had a great fuckin night. I remember him saying a few times 'there is no better buzz then this'. Around 2am we parted ways. I went home with my wife and my Bro went in and went to bed with his wife.Around 9am the next morning I got a call from my sister; she woke up to her peaceful looking husband cuddled up to her except the problem was he was cold and his lips were blue. He of course was dead and had been dead for quite some time. He couldn't be resessitated.Later we searched the house and found nothing so I figure he must have snorted all 5 bags.As you can imagine, the fallout from this incident has been a complete fucking train wreck like I have never seen. I'm 29, he was only 28 and my sister is destroyed in every way. Imagine waking up to the lifeless body of your soulmate right in your face. She said she originally woke up because she was feeling cold from something - it was my bro's cold lifeless body. I can not even believe this happened to me - I can not believe I am a statistic - I was always one of you guys reading these stories - never being part of one. My sister knew about the valiums and xanax but not the H. I had to tell her about that, that we lied, sneaking in the bathroom and doing lines. went behind her back, etc.Holy shit guys, please be fucking careful with this shit. You don't need a needle to OD and die from it.My wife raided my stash of drugs and flushed everything down the toilet and I was happy to let her do it. (I kept quiet about the small stash of MS Contins I had hidden in the basement because I'm a fucker and I still wanna get high) And you know what's sicker still, is that my sister made me swear to never do the shit again and I'm already high on a handful of MS Contins right now - I even thought about shooting these things for my farewell salute to drugs but if that went wrong - the repercussions would be Earth-shattering for my already-fucked family.. Even though I am high, I don't plan on getting any more of these and going back to the simple old beer and whiskey routine.Fuck. I'm not going to preach to anybody, just learn from my mistake, don't ever let somebody go to sleep on heavy doses of H - even snorted - they might not ever wake up... I've been doing E for 2 or 3 years, I've only done around 30 or so pills and I never do more than 1 1/2 at a time. I'm a pretty careful user and I'd never had a serious reaction. I think the problem this time may have been that I was stressed out in general and had a bad experience with a girl I thought I trusted. I was a bit depressed I guess. Anyway, after getting a bit drunk, maybe 7 or 8 drinks, I was still in control, me and a friend decided to do some E. I knew it didn't combine well with drink, so we split one pill between us. I was in a great mood at this point from drinking and felt brilliant as the E started to kick in and slowly build up to that feeling of euphoria. You know the feeling, when you know you're just going to have a great night. Then it all started to go wrong. I started to get anxious, and everything seemed wrong. I've had it before, it's a common reaction, you just ride it out. But this felt a lot worse and was coming on fast. I spent the next couple of hours worrying like crazy, convinced I'd hurt myself badly. After a few hours I calmed down, but I still felt all wrong. I was in control, but my head was just telling me something was going wrong, and it was intense. I smoked some cigarettes and sat around watching others dance at the club we were at until I went home to sleep.The next day was the worst feeling, when you wake up and your head is just on fire. I had a massive headache, it was ringing like nothing else and I still felt really anxious and was shaking. By now I was really scared. The day after was even worse, I couldn't go to work. I couldn't relax, I was completely on edge, I drifted between watching TV for 2 minutes to going for a walk. Nothing could take my mind off it, I was in a permanent state of anxiety. I don't know if it was nervous exhaustion, but my vision started to slow down and get blurry. I couldn't eat or sleep anymore. I was completely exhausted but couldn't sleep, I was in that state you get when you're coming down off E and you just want to drift off but you can't. I went and saw a doctor and he told me not to worry, it'd wear off, but I didn't believe him. I thought I had brain damage. I was off work for a week and I'm on anti-depressants now. Two weeks later I feel much better, though still slightly on edge and down. As a former alcohol abuser, I thought I'd do a short writeup on the varying effects of different psychedelics when combined with alcohol, along with some warnings and good combinations.  Effects varied from great to horrible, generally relating to the order in which the two were ingested.  I have quit drinking but this information may be useful to those who drink.  I generally prefer the effects of these substances when taken alone but all of these have been tried at varying times.    YMMV. LSD + Alcohol - LSD tends to override the effects of even large amounts of alcohol almost completely, regardless of the order in which they are taken.   This becomes a problem, because mass quantities can be consumed and the effects will not be noted until the LSD is wearing off and my head feels like its been beaten about by a crew of LA police officers for a good part of the evening.   I found it very easy to drink more than necessary or more than I wanted to on this combo.  Not recommended. Psylocybin + Alcohol - Fine to mix in small amounts, better if the mushrooms are consumed first.   Still easy to gauge the level of alcohol intoxication, sort of a synergy with the body buzz and mental is affected by the alcohol less than usual, but still noticeable.  Ok with a beer or two, no need or real desire to drink more than that.  GI problems usually noted. 2C-T-x + Alcohol - Unknown safety.   Alcohol is felt but functions remain.   Almost guaranteed vomiting if alcohol is consumed prior to ingestion of the 2C-T-x, some GI distress.  These do not seem to mix very well at all.   Drinking late in the trip (T+8h or so depending on the chemical) is ok, but not something I'd repeat.   Drinking before can cause some seriously bad bodily feelings lasting hours into the trip, even with minor (1 beer) amounts of alcohol.   2C-T-2 never causes vomiting or nausea for me normally, did in the case of 1 beer beforehand.  2C-T-21 caused 6 hours of a horrible sick feeling and lack of energy / near catatonia when ingested after 3 drinks.   Not recommended.  2C-I + Alcohol - Only tried late in the trip, not something I would repeat.  Predict similar reaction as 2C-T-xs if drinking beforehand.  2C-E + Alcohol - Similar to 2C-T-21.  Light drinking beforehand, severe nausea but no vomiting, hours of feeling very ill which evolved into an extreme paranoia and fear during the peak, recovered slowly afterwards.   Low dose 2C-E with alcohol consumed afterwards (T+4) was ok, but not good.   Ketamine + Alcohol - Vaguely recall.   Dizziness and vertigo, would not repeat.  Similar stories from everyone else I've talked to. MDMA + Alcohol - Good if low amounts of alcohol are consumed after the trip starts, especially as the peak starts wearing down as they can bring it back up for a short duration.  Easy to drink too much and completely override the MDMA effects.  MDMA 'hangover' is much worsened with small amounts, but this isn't a bad combo as long as one remembers to drink enough water.  Could be dangerous otherwise.  Methylone + Alcohol - Even large amounts do not seem to affect the empathic push of this substance, but strange 'stuttering' of memory was noted although not that much alcohol had been consumed.   Would be nice if it wasn't for this, might be better in a private environment, but is probably better alone.  Same hydration advice applies, probably not too great on the body.  Salvia Divinorum + Alcohol - Anesthetic effect during peak is increased greatly enough to make this pointless.  Ego reintegration is much more confusing, not recommended.  These are all that have been tried at some point.  Generally the alcohol amounts are around 2-3 beers max, although noted exceptions are the Methylone (ingested 180mg Methylone after 2nd beer, continued drinking beer and water for remainder of the night with no decrease in effects but various short periods of memory loss), and LSD (drank heavily a few times on it and didn't realize it until the next morning).    The general trend has been that the tryptamines tend to be ok, or even kind of good in the case of mushrooms with low amounts, phens just shouldn't be combined with alcohol at all, and the MDxxs are kind of iffy.   Be careful and keep your water intake on par with your alcohol intake, and watch for signs of dehydration.   Alcohol and psychedelics are on the opposite ends of the good/evil spectrum in my opinion and probably shouldn't be mixed, but some like to drink, as I did, and you may find this useful. It had been a long week of partying at my friend's house while his parents were away, when we had an idea. We had spent the week drinking like fish and smoking more pot than we knew what to do with, when the idea came to us that we should find something that would be a stronger mind trip. So, being the connected person that I am called a few people, and 5 hours later held in my hand 10 grams of P. cubensis, due to the difficulty I had in finding Acid. We agreed that when we all got home the next day, we were going to go back over to Mike's house and shroom together. Personally, I like to shroom on my own, as I get very insightful, however, we decided that we would all trip together.I show up at Mike's house around 8:30 PM, the last one to arrive (also the one with the shrooms!). Mike's house is in it's usual state of disarray due to entirely too many drunken pothead dudes hanging around. I clear a path to my chair (that I claimed many moons ago as mine and mine alone when I am at his house), throw the Mad Dog bottles out of it and sit down. I take out my baggie, extract three nicely-shaped caps, grab a box of KFC from the end table and relax. Kyle takes the other three caps, giving us about 5 grams each. We chew the caps, swallow them and promptly start eating everything in sight to prevent the unhappy upsetness our stomachs usually experience on this wonderful substance. We sit back, me in my chair, and Kyle on the couch, and wait for the effects to be felt. 45 minutes pass, and we have yet to notice anything. About this time, Josh walks in the room with the bowl of Jell-O I made the night before. This was no ordinary Jell-O. Of the total 4 cups liquid needed to make a box, 1 cup was Redrum. He sits down and begins to scarf the wonderful concoction. Kyle and myself, upset at missing out on this, and upset about not noticing anything from the shrooms yet, get up and have some of the Jell-O. We take turns eating spoonfuls from the bowl. About the time that I am eating my fifth spoonful (about the equivalent of 4 oz. Redrum) I begin to notice that the quivering Jell-O has some sort of abnormal importance to me, almost a Buddhist feeling of guilt, like in a previous life I was some form of Jell-O. I begin to feel guilty for eating it without being concerned about how the Jell-O feels about being eaten. Realizing that at long last, the shrooms are having an effect, I return to my seat to ponder what it would be like if the Jell-o was eating me.About this time, Kyle starts to talk about a wild visual he is having, about the guitarist from Mudvayne dancing with Bowser and the mushroom dude from Mario Brothers. Kyle is just a weird sort of guy. He will randomly come up with bizarre visuals, that seem to have no real importance. However, when I use P. cubensis, I almost always come back down feeling like I know more about the universe and how everything is linked together. For instance, what the cosmic relationship between order and chaos has to do with cats, or, more specifically, Mike's cat. Tigee, a tiger striped cat, is normally a very anti-social beast. He is perfectly content to be left alone. This evening, however, he was the guardian of all in the house. He kept a very watchful eye on everyone who had any significant amounts of drugs/alcohol in their systems. He was especially watchful of Kyle and myself, and at one point we made eye contact.What I saw in the eyes of that cat is difficult to explain. He had a profound oldness of spirit, almost a wise and longing gaze that made me feel as if I was in the presence of a higher being. He moved about the room in a way that seemed to be much more intelligent than I had ever thought before. He was checking every nook and cranny systematically, as if looking for something. Finding nothing, he came back to me, sat on my chest and stared me right in the eyes. He spoke directly into my mind, telling me that he was one of a chosen few souls on the earth that was charged with protecting it from whatever would do it harm. He reported directly to something that he tried to define as the Earth's soul, or nature embodied, but I could not seem to comprehend what he was talking about. He told me that I had just passed through one of the states of consciousness that very few people make it to, that only a handful of human beings knew of the existence of his kind. He told me that because I had crossed into that state and found out about their kind, that someday I may be called upon to complete a task in the name of the Earth. My conversation with the cat continued for some time, until he was called away to do something important. At that point, I spent the remainder of my trip marvelling at how good my hair and skin felt, and periodically catching a small visual. Ever since I came down, the cat has still acted differently around me, and has continued to make me marvel at how every movement it makes seems to be somehow connected to its mission to defend the planet. The night began when my girlfriend and I were at a local club.  We had a few beers, then decided we'd go home, take some acid, and return to the club.  Upon returning home, we each took a hit of (apparently) some very strong acid.  The most I've done before was 4 hits of pretty strong acid, but this one hit outdoes that by far, but we'll get to that later.So my girlfriend and I after having consumed our hits, decided to watch a little TV, and get some rest while waiting for our trip to begin. The onset was pretty slow, roughly an hour or so for noticeable effects (I've had trips start in about 15 min before). After the effects really started to begin, we got into our usual 'giggly' mindset of acid, where everything seems so new, and we feel quite mischievous.This continued on for a while or so, until my girlfriend and I noticed that we were continuing to get higher, approximately 2 hours after we had taken our acid, and at a rapid rate.  It's at this point that we smoked some marijuana, just because we were a bit apprehensive at such a long yet rapid continuing come up.  The weed did nothing to slow us down though, and we just continued to get higher and higher.  For an example of how high we really were...I was able to move my hand in a circle, to create a tracer, then I was able to hit that tracer, and have it glide down my vision.  I was also able to close my eyes for a visual, then grab my head, pull that visual out of my head, and throw it into reality. I also saw my ceiling turn into a black hole, whereupon everything was ever so slightly being sucked into it, in a blurry way, such that everything existed where it was, but it was also being sucked into the black hole at the same time.  I also received tactile hallucinations, I began to feel as though I was floating towards it for a moment. It was all getting just a bit overwhelming for us though, and we decided to change rooms.It's at this point, that things really started to change. Moving into another room just increased our coming up even more, and this is roughly 3 hrs into the trip.  I remember that at one point, all my senses formed into one sense, or consciousness, however there is no word to express what it was (I'm sure those of you that do acid frequently know what it's like to have a feeling and no word to express it), my eyes saw the same thing open as closed, which would have just been color, in a way; my ears constantly heard a low droning sound, and I couldn't feel how I was oriented in space.  If I THOUGHT of a word, I would hear it, only broken up, (ex. wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo wo rd rd rd rd rd rd).  I also felt quite disconnected from my body.  There was also this feeling that all this sensory information I was getting, was also judging me in a way, it was painful, but also relieving in that it was cleansing in a sense.  It also felt as though we were trying to receive all the information that could possibly exist, at one time, and our minds weren't able to handle it all.  We had it together psychologically the whole time though.My girlfriend and I endured for what we figure was about 3 hrs of this, and eventually, we decided enough was enough.  At this point we took a cap of MDA each and waited.  At about the time we took the MDA, to one hour after that, we basically have no memory.  When our thoughts returned to us, and we began to feel the gentle warming sensation of MDA in our bodies, we were lying huddled on our bathroom floor.  As it really started to kick in, things became brighter, clearer, and my mind was again able to think.  We sat and discussed the 'trip' we had just been through, and we came to the conclusion that very few people have been there.  We weren't sure what 'there' really was, we were happy we weren't 'there' anymore, yet, it wasn't a bad trip.  Never once was I overpowered by bad thoughts, the fact of it is, the sheer volume of sensory information prohibited me from having thoughts at all. It was the feeling of being absolutely overwhelmed and completely vulnerable. However at some points, I received quite a rush when I felt like I could funnel the 'energy' of the trip through me, and I was able to function, but I could only do that for so long, before I lied back down and stared into space.So, I'm not too sure as how to rate it as being good or bad, I'm happy I've been there, but I'm also happy I'm not there now.  In the end, it feels almost like a rite of passage for trippers. This experience was by no means my first with alcohol and I have drunk much greater quantities than this, but as a result of the speed at which I consumed the booze, this is the most drunk I have ever been. I was going through a minor depression of sorts, and I really wanted to just have a few beers with my friends. It was a Saturday evening, and I had done nothing exciting the whole weekend thus far. I was itchin' to be in an altered state of mind. I made some phone calls but everyone was unavailable. I figured I'd just buy a little thing of booze and get a slight buzz going and relax in my bedroom. Telling my parents that I was going for a bike ride (I am 21 but live at home; my parents don't mind drinking but would disapprove of my drinking alone) I headed down to the Liquor Commission and bought a mickey (13oz) of Bacardi white rum. I got on my bike and headed out to a semi-secluded wooded area where I lay on the riverbank and forced down a few shots. I probably had about 4.5 ounces or so.  Feeling a slight buzz, I stuffed some gum in my mouth, stuck the mickey in my pants under my shirt, and returned home. I poured a huge glass of orange juice and went back to my room.  I drank about a third of the OJ and poured rum in until it was full again. It wasn't too nasty, and I kept gulping it while I watched TV.  I had a bit of a buzz, but not much, so after the OJ was gone, I finished the rest of the bottle. I laid down in my bed and stared at the ceiling, wondered why I wasn't very drunk.  That is the last thing I remember.I woke up at 5:30 am with a blinding headache and a bone-dry mouth. I had a vague recollection of a dream where I vomited on my friend's coffee table and his parents banned me from their home.  There was so much vomit I knew it had to be a dream.  Although I was painfully hung over, I was relieved to wake from my awful dream. I knew I had been drunk the night before, and figured I had just passed out in front of the TV, but I could remember nothing.Something was wrong though.  It was the middle of winter, and I had awoke wearing only my briefs. Even in the summer I always wear a t-shirt to bed.I stood up and wracked my brain. An image of me hugging my own toilet popped into my head.  I checked the toilet and there was no evidence of vomit. I guess I had remembered to flush. I was quite alarmed that I had zero recollection of the previous night's events. I went downstairs to see if I had knocked anything over or something, because I could have done anything and I'd never remember.When I got to the bottom of the stairs the smell hit me. Wretched, rancid puke smell.  I looked into the living room and there it was: the coffee table was absolutely COVERED in puke except for two places: where I had tried to wipe it with my shirt, and where I had tried to wipe it with my pants. Evidently I didn't make much of an effort to clean it before deciding it was hopeless and going back to bed I guess. I cleaned my puke reasonably well before my parents saw it, but when my dad asked me why I was up so early I said it was to clean up my puke (I was still half-drunk).  He assumed I had gone to a bar the night before, until my mom told him I was home the whole night. My parents asked me if I was having 'problems' and I said no, and that I had learned my lesson about drinking alone.  I had. I am a diabetic who drinks Alcohol whenever I can get some. This is not so much a certain experience, but an overall experience. I have grown to learn that when I drink lets say anywhere from 4 to 11 beers one night the next day around 12:00 or so my blood sugar drops very low. Not only do I get low the next day I have a major hangover and it impairs my ability to tell if I'm low in the first place. So I have made a certain list of adaptations to dealing with my blood sugar while drinking.1. I always check my blood level before I even start drinking to make sure I'm not starting off at a low level.2. I always make sure that I check my blood level during the drunkiness. I know this sounds hard, but I keep track of numbers as much as possible so I know where I am.3. I always let someone know or drink with someone who does know about diabetes. Also I make sure that person knows how to treat a low blood level if it should occur.4. After I have fallen to sleep and I wake up the next morning with a pounding headache, I check my blood level to make sure it isn't low already. *I am sure to check often the next day to ensure that I will catch the blood level falling. Cause it will fall at some point, I just have to figure out when!!!I hope this helps some other fellow diabetic to keep it under control while drinking alcohol. I recently ran across a website that sells an authentic 'Viking Mead Kit'. Being an occasional home brewer, I decided to grab a kit and try it out.I'd heard that one can just brew mead with honey and water, but the package I received contained additional unidentifiable [save for oak leaf and moss] herbs and seeds in a cloth satchet along with a container of organic orange blossom honey.I added all of the ingredients and ~4.5 gallons of purified water to a 5-gallon glass jug. The jug was cork stoppered and placed in the closet. I came home from work the next day to a house filled with a sweet, bready smell. Upon inspection the jug had blown its cork and sprayed my clothes. This stuff was CO2 volatile! The airtight plug was exchanged for a clean mayonnaise jar lid which allowed the mix to 'burp'.30-40 days passed and I invited 3 of my psychonaut friends over to quaff. I strained and decanted each of us 1 gallon. We hit the deep woods with our bounty and climbed into an abandoned deer hunting platform [20 feet off the ground]. We said our own individual drinking sayings and turned up. The mead was clear and astringent, almost effervescent with alcohol. It portrayed a lightly sweet berry aroma, although we couldn't discern why it would. A half-hour later, we were unexpectedly f*cked up. It is a unique and seemingly friendly ancient buzz, not a downer like beer, but more like a bubbly wine fuzzy-giddiness. I noticed we eventually started talking and laughing loudly and the fear of falling from the tree waned.  The spirit drinking being complete, we set about a 'Wyk' adventure which was comprised primarily of swaggering at large trees, yelling at the gods, and berserking on boulders. We knew that the spirits of Valhalla watched us as we praised their oft-used concoction. The next morning did not bring the expected sharp hangover. Only a numb memory and bramble scratches described the previous Viking venture. Don't drink and climb! A little background info:  About 1.5 years ago I was what you could call an alcoholic by the amount I drank (almost daily), but I wasn't addicted.  I quit drinking about 7 months ago and haven't touched a drop yet, thanks to a spiritual experience.  I have been smoking/eating Cannabis for two years.Whenever I trip (believe me, eating 4 grams of cannabis is a trip!) I write it down in a log.  I had been thinking about the cannabis high and the alcohol buzz (which I had forgotten) and decided to experiment.  NIGHT ONE:  I ate 2 cookies containing 2-2.5 grams of cannabis each.  After an hour the familiar efects came - drymouth, red eye, munchies, and a nice trip.  My imagination always runs wild, I sit back and pretend.  This time I had memories of good times with an old friend and drinking in Paris.  I was full of such warm happiness, I can't even describe it.  I was feeling sad, thinking how awesome they were.  This gradually left and I felt my body feel like it was shaking and just layed back and enjoyed some music before I passed out.NIGHT TWO:  I figure if I was to visit an old friend, why not get something good?  I drove to the liquor store and grabbed 2 cases of Smirnoff ICE - at 7% each.  I love the taste of those things :)  I proceeded to drink 6 of them rather quickly.  At first there was that nice warm body buzz.  But it was different than with Marijuana, it feels almost dirty in comparison and like my body is dulled instead of becoming sharper (as with MJ).  I felt rather drunk and almost equally depressed.  I decided to go for a walk at 3.30am and wandered into a construction zone and then snuck into a forested area inside a private tennis club.  I had a huge urge to be with people - anyone - and wandered around making scenarios up of me seeing people I knew.I walked home and passed out.  I can't stress the synthetic and dirty feeling enough.  I woke up feeling like shit, a lot worse than being burnt out.  NIGHT THREE:  I've gotten this far, why not mix the two?  I had the same amount of cookies (2) from the same batch, along with 6 new Smirnoff ICE bottles... a scientific control if you will :)Definetly not a nice feeling.  I drank a bit while waiting for the Marijuana efects.  Took about two hours before I could seperate them from the alcohol feeling.  Imagine wearing the whitest, cleanest clothes and jumping in the dirtiest mud.  This is how I felt.In conclusion, use cannabis and refrain from alcohol!  I have had more alcohol (this is not gloating, it was irresponsible and wrong) than people could believe, so I assumed the effects would be an old pleasure.  I see how alcohol is a 'social' drug though, because that feeling of absolute NEED for others was intense.  Cannabis is nice with or without people, in fact I prefer it without. It was a wed. Night, I had just gotten over a virus of some sort, and was perscribed tylenol with codine to suppress my cough, and help me sleep.  Some how my friends convinced me to go out, I figured I'd take a tylenol with codine... And I'd be okay and out of any discomfort from my cough or what not.  I also decided that I wouldn't drink a lot.  I ended up having 3 beers (which isn't a lot), in about an hour... I was feeling a buzz, but didn't want to drink any more b/c I had taken the pain killer. Pretty soon my two friends and I wanted to head over to a fraternity house, where we regularly smoke weed.  I was feeling really good in the car, and decided that the perfect end to the night would be smoking some weed, and going to bed.  When we all got up to our friend Brian's room, I was anxious to smoke some and go to bed.  My best friend took the hit before me, and she took a really good big long hit... The guys were clapping. So of course I had to do better if not match her bong hit.  We would always see who could take a bigger hit, and clear it completely.  I usually don't smoke out of bongs because I had a bad high the first time I smoked out of one.  However, it had been a few years, and I had recently smoked out of the bong... Which was Brian's and it was about 2 ft high.  I knew I had taken a really big hit, b/c I couldn't stop coughing, and a few mins after my face began to get flushed.  I know I'm going to get really high when my face gets flushed.  Then it happened, like all the other times I got paranoid when smoking weed.  I looked down at my hands, and they didn't seem to be a part of my body, and It felt like I had just woken up from a dream.  I knew I was going to be 'scary' high, and started to dwell on this fact, which didn't help me at all.  Every now and then I'd look up and feel like I had just awoken from a dream, and everything that had just happened... Seemed like it was forever ago.  I looked at Sue, and told her that I needed to go home now.  I kept saying it.  All I wanted to do was go home and have some sense of self.  Then I looked at Michelle and said the same thing, I think they both thought I was crazy.  Sue asked me if I needed to go to the bathroom. I said yes, and went with her.  I couldn't even see myself in the mirror.  Sue asked if I needed to throw up, and I said yes... So I started to make myself throw up for no apparent reason.  I kept telling her 'I am in this world, but I'm not... And I can see myself through a little hole'. I can't exactly explain this feeling, and it usually happens a little when I'm really high, but this was out of control.  I started to remind myself about how I got there, and started thinking about everything that happened in the past hours that lead me to the frat where I was throwing up.  My perception of my own self was messed up.  I didn't feel like the same person, I didn't feel that I looked how I normally looked, etc... I couldn't even tell you where I was from until I really thought about it.  Sue realized that I needed to go home, and I was getting deeper into my paranoia state.  The next thing I knew, I was walking outside on my way home clutching Sue's arm.  I kept telling her my heels were sinking, and they were... Into the mud.  I also felt as if I were slanted sideways.  And somewhere along the way, I peed my pants, and that is the first time i've ever peed my pants while messed up from drugs... (I only smoke weed and drink alcohol) anyway the whole walk home seemed like it took hours, while it only lasted about 10 mins.  When I got to my dorm, I went straight to my other best friend Steph's room. I soon realized that I needed to actually finish peeing... Sorry thats gross but, I went to the bathroom and peed, and then came back and sat on steph's floor.  I woke up her roommate and demanded a gatorade.  She gave me one, and they took a picture of me out of control laughing on the floor spilling it everywhere.  I looked at the trash can, and made a face and said... I don't feel so well.  I felt nauseated all of a sudden. This part gets a little graphic and gross, sorry... So Steph and Sue quickly ran me to the bathroom, I sat and puked for 2 hours, straight... Still high as hell... In fact I was basically dry heaving, because I hadn't had anything in my stomach.  I was so sick, I threw up every 3-10 mins, and I couldn't comprehend anything that was going on around me. I wouldn't let anyone touch me b/c I felt so sick, in fact I couldn't even put water in my mouth because it made me start to convulse.  After 2 and a half hours in the bathroom, one of the girls wanted to call the medics, Steph and Sue being my loyal friends came and gave me a pep talk, about how I did not want to get caught by the police, and and that I need to pull myself together and if necessary puke in the trash can in their dorm room.  They had to literally pick me up off the floor, and carry me.  I layed down on her floor and totally passed out, I woke up a few hours later and sat straight up realizing the nights events and said 'what the fuck' loudly, I think I was still a little high.  I was weak the next day, and was pretty embarassed.  I still smoke weed, and drink, however I don't recommend mixing the two with a pain killer. I guess thats what the problem was, because I've drank and smoked together a lot more, and it was never like it was.  It scared the hell out of me, and it was the worst night of my life. Take this as a story or a warning, or just a little advice. There's a little history that lead up to this whole thing. Maybe it'll explain why I was so 'off the chain'. First, I'm no kid. I'm a 32 year old, white, career person. I'm not any kind of sloucher dope fiend. I just party on the weekend once and awhile. On Thursday night my husband decided to shoot some pool in a tournament. He got stupid drunk and passed out in his truck. He didn't come home until 6:30am in the morning. I know from sources, that he was where he said he was, for all of you thinking he was off with some slut. That still didn't make me any less mad. Friday night he was going camping with the guys. I was going out with my girls. I had 1 blue Xanax and about 2 shots of Quervo Gold for later. I smoked a bowl, then about 9:30pm I left for the local small town bar. I ate half of my Xanax (pie as we call em) and drank the 2 shots. I didn't want to get too fucked up while driving. It takes about an hour for anything except acid to hit me, so I was safe. I got to the club and my girlfriend gives me a percocet I ate it and the other half of my pie. Goal for the night....Get Fucked Up Royally. About an hour after this I found out my husband & the guys didn't go camping because of rain. They show up at the bar. I was pissed and told him not to talk to me. My girlfriend's husband gives me another blueberry pie. I must have ate it. I was drinking a lot (funny thing was that I only spent $10. I bought two shots, $4.50 EACH). I know of one guy that bought me a drink, after that I couldn't tell ya. In the meantime this young guy sits next to me while I was resting from dancing. I remember thinking that he isn't all that cute, but there was something he said that made me take an interest in him. I don't remember his name or what he looks like all that much. I remember telling him thank you several times because he kept telling me how beautiful I was. I get that a lot so it wasn't the compliments, it was something else. I just can't remember what. Could be where I got the rest of the drinks for the night. That may have made him interesting at the time. I do remember dancing with my friends when he came up behind me and he put his face near my neck. That's when my husband told him to quit pawing his wife. I didn't know I was being pawed! I don't know what I said to people that night. I do remember saying that I'd sure like to have a joint. To top it off, 2 people that I work with were in the bar that night (I try not to show my wild side at work). My husband, give the guy a hand, apparently put up with this behavior and did not even beat my fan to a pulp, which he normally would have done. Of course the next day he told me about the half of a morphine patch he'd had. Maybe that was why violence didn't come into play. Anyway, the next thing I remember was standing in my bedroom and my husband handing me the slinkiest gown I have. Then waking up VERY pissed off because he was leaving to go camping again, and he was telling me that I'd sat with this guy for 2 hours at the bar. He said my fan kept putting his hands on my back and stuff. I didn't believe him and got so mad I threw all of his clothes out and told him not to come back. Now this gets more interesting. Sometime Friday night I bought another half pint of Quervo because it was on the table. At about noon I opened it and drank the whole thing. Result=Fucked Up again daisey! I called my girl and she came and got me. I had all intentions of going out again to show him a thing or two. After I got to her house she told me that Friday night I'd left the bar with her husband and my #1 fan tried to follow me but was told to go away. I think he was on some serious drugs too. I apparently went to her house and locked myself in the bathroom for awhile. I don't remember being there at all. She confirmed that this guy & I were very cozy for about 2 hours. They thought I knew him. After I sat around and watched a movie I sobered up, went & got something to eat and decided that I was a terrible mother for even thinking about getting tore up and going out two nights in a row. I went and rented a movie. Left my wallet there even though I was sober (I think) at this time.  Went back and got it, then picked up my kids about 40 min. later from my mothers house and went home. I watched a movie and went to sleep. I let my husband back in Sunday morning and helped put his clothes back. I think my emotions were out of wack.Today is Monday and I am very frustrated that I have a whole night that I don't remember. Thank Heaven I had my friends and my husband there because I could have done anything with anyone and not known it! I will not ever take more than one pie again. I will never do that without being with my husband so he can take care of me. I really don't like being that tore up. What's the fun if you don't remember? If you're thinking about drinking and taking Xanax, PLEASE have someone you trust with you. Do not think that just because you do drugs a lot that you're immune to this kind of thing. I can honestly say that I have NEVER EVER been that fucked up, EVER. And people think Extasy is bad. HA! I laugh. I've ate 6 beans in 6 hours before and NEVER been that out of my mind!!!!  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] T+0-5min.: two friends and I smoke a conservative bowl of decent pot from my bubbler. T+1hr20min: enjoying a relatively mild, controllable high, I drive to a party with friends and have one beer which affects me a lot for one beer, presumably because of my heightened senses. T+2hr10min: (approximate because of time distortion) we drive back to campus and eat in the CUB. We relax with the tv and computers at the coffeeshop.T+3hr30min: we drive back to the party where my friend decides he wants to not drink more, but to be designated driver and smoke again. Within an hour and change, I drink 6 beers. I'm feeling pretty good and very functional. I can carry on conversations and my coordination is decent, but I'm clearly drunk. My high from the pot can no longer be identified through the drunkenness.T+4hr10min: we drive out and smoke again, a mixture of his schwagg and some very nice nugs. I take 4 or 5 hits, but the last one or two are resin hits smoked by laying the flame on the tar and shit at the bottom of the bowl. As usual, the last hits of that tar-like resin blow me away for a little while. My friend drives us back to the campus parking lot, but on the way we begin to feel heavily the effects of the pot. T+4hr25min: I experience extreme racing thoughts. I see closed eye visuals resembling a rainbow starfield in a strobe light. My body rocks back and forth with the rhythm of the flashing images in my head. I rap off thoughts without control and at a pace unlike any other. I start rambling about the intensity of my high. My words run together and each syllable is stressed deliberately, even splitting words up to their component sound segments, and the ideas thereby isolated, I feel as if I am expressing thoughts perhaps never expressed before. The ideas in my head are so void of connotation and ambiguity that the set and setting of the car and its occupants becomes drastically changed. I explain that what I'm having is somehow different because of the closed eye visuals and breakneck pace of my racing thoughts. 'A' begins to experience presumably a similar high as myself, and I attempt to watch him while also enjoying my own high. His body convulses and he speaks in a tongue unknown to himself. I respond in another language to his sounds. Our exchanges freak the third party, but only because he doesn't know our languages; did I just say that? I continue to rock forward and back while speaking rapidly and seeing things. My equilibrium shot, I begin feeling a little nauseaus. I throw up the cheese pizza, but continue to have closed eye visuals. When I open my eyes, I perceive the twisting world in front of me in stereoscopic, beautiful detail. 'A' switches tongues and continues to convulse. He cannot respond to sean, and sean worries about him. 'A''s breathing seems safely contolled, so 'b' and I leave him alone. My mind races even faster when perceiving the near infinite detail of a face or the upholstry, and I become naseaus again. For that reason, I close my eyes. I remain in this naseaus black tunnel of projection screen eyelid movies for at least 20 minutes. The visuals never became clear, but had intense colors and some shifting, gridlike patterns, meanwhile, 'a' is coming down and he drives 'b' back to his residence hall. I lack the coordination to walk or the desire to, because I want to continue focusing on the still-enjoyable high with which I have burdened myself. Eventually 'a' leads me back to our residence hall, and the walking combined with cold air helps my nasuea, despite the dry heaves contradicting my reported improvement in condition. T+?(major time distortion): I climb into bed and sleep soundly. Now, at 9am the next morning, I still feel some aural distortion effects of the high and grogginess from the alcohol. Conclusion: given the choice to go back to last night with a guarantee that I would have the same experience if I drank those beers, I would accept. In retrospect, we decided this was not like a paranoid freakout. We all remained calm despite our inability to control the situation. I've seen a paranoia freakout complete with yelling, hysterical girls, and this was a wild, but totally individually focused trip--not a freakout. Truly, this was a high that could not be endured repeatedly, but it taught me to be careful with beer and pot.  DOSE: 7 shots oral Alcohol - Hard \\xa0 \\xa0 200 mg insufflated Modafinil (pill / tablet)            BODY WEIGHT:   160 lb         At around 11 o clock, my friends and I began drinking. It was nothing new. After about 7 shots or so of some vodka, I started to feel a pretty heavy buzz. At this time I remembered the Provigils I had recently collected from a friend.I have had experience with provigils before, and they have all been quite similar to the experiences listed online, but this was a truly different experience. I pulled two 100mg provigils from a bag and proceeded to finely crush them and form them into two large lines. I was expecting the normal upper feelings with the unique provigil intoxicated high that comes along. However, after my first line, the effects were immediate. I all of a sudden became heavily intoxicated yet almost clear at the same time. I sprawled myself on the floor where I could tell that sight and sound was amplified but somewhat unimportant to me. I then daringly snorted the next line which gave the same immediate feeling. From then on stuff began to get a little blurry, but I remember trying my hardest to have a normal conversation, but all I could focus on was the way my own voice sounded. It was almost as if I was hearing my voice echo. The experience was very enjoyable and I would definitely recommend it.Though the experience sounds very hallucinagenic, I believe that the unique feelings were just due to the strange combining effects of the drowsy intoxication of alcohol and the high of provigil. Well, it all started with a hard day a work...damn...time to come home and drink some beer which had been my unhealthy routine after work.  A girl I know called me and asked if I would come pick her up so we could hang out being only slightly buzzed I decided it would be a good idea.  A night like that needed a little kick and some lowered inhibitions so I threw in 2 mg of Xanax for fun.  And this was all before I left to go and pick up this dear freind of mine.  Anyhow, me, being addicted to DXM and doing the substance for more than two years wanted to trip that night as well.  Two bottles of Robotussin Maximum Strenght Cough were picked up and drunk before I picked the girl up.  Well, the Xanax and alcohol had fucked up my mind and I was already having a little trouble driving.  I picked the girl up and then we went to Taco Bell to see some friend we both know there.  After about half an hour she knew something was wrong with me so after her asking I took her home.  What happened that night after she got out of the car is a mystery to me......I woke up standing in my room at 4:30 am and my dad was up.  I found out that I had taken a side mirror off of our car and scratched the side up pretty bad.  On top of all that I was talking shit to my parents for like four hours...saying all of this nasty shit to them.All I have to say is that I have an addictive personality.  I always said I would never do what I did and it still happened.  Drugs control me....I always said they didn't but they do...and it really sucks because to tell you the truth I love drugs escpecially DXM.  Maybe if I lived on a desterted island I could do all the drugs I want. But drugs, for me, do not work in this day and age.  I have hurt myself, phisically and mentally, and the ones around me and now I am fucked...to say the least.To sum it all up...all I have to say is be careful...everyone.  Drugs are fun but some people cannot handle them.  Everything has an effect, on you and other around you and only you can do what you think is the best thing to do.EX_DXMTRIPPER At 7:30 PM one Friday night, I ingested 354 mg of DXM (dextromethorphan HBr).  I really did not anticipate doing any other drugs due to the fact that I had stayed up late the night before and was pretty tired.  About 8:30 the first effects of the DXM were felt and I got into a pretty good mood while using the internet and listening to music.  After about 1 hour and 30 minutes after taking the DXM I remembered that I had roughly five shots of Tequila stashed away.  My mood was lifted as I quickly downed two shots of the liquor.  Beacuse of the DXM I could feel the alcohol move down my throat and into my stomach, it was a pleasant feeling and I was soon greeted by more disassociation and a care-free mood that left me feeling like I was on type of the world.  It was more of a mental eupohoria than that of a body one like an opiate would produce.  After three hour of this same feeling I realized that the alcohol had made the DXM last a lot longer.  I forgot to mention that I had a cold and after about 3 hours of ingesting the DXM and alcohol I also took 1 Benadryl for my nose and just for kicks.  I knew the Benadryl would make me a little drowsy so I also took 1 yellow jacket that contained 25 mg of ephedrine.These two pills were washed down  with the remaining 3 shots of Tequila and by the time all of the drugs kicked in I was feeling great.  I experienced the effects from all of drugs at one time.  I could feel the disassocitaion of the DXM, the drunkeness of the alcohol, the sedated feeling from the Benadryl, and the sped up feeling from the ephedrine.  The mental effects of this synergy were amazing but my motor skills and ability to walk straight were highly uncooridinated.  I do not believe I could have walked straight even if I had tried to.  After a while of this I decided that I would go to bed and get a full nights rest...it was about 12:00 am and I needed the sleep anyway.  I drifted off peacefully to sleep.Overall this was a good experience and I would repeat it.  The only thing I would change is the amount of Benadryl (diphenhydramine) that I took.  I would take 4 or 5 next time.  Benadryl in high doses is a 'recreational drug' if you could call it that...except it makes you too tired to enjoy the high.  I believe that the 1 yellow jacket would take care of this.  Also, ephedrine, for me, is only good at lower does (under 150 mg), anything above this and I become very agitated and just plain shaky due to over-stimulation.  I just wanted to write this to tell about my experience and show how fun synergy can be but I wanted to say that moderation is the key.  Keep cool and stay safe.DXMTRIPPER  I wake up. I'm a bit dizzy. I know am at my friend's place, but I don't remember falling asleep the night previous. In fact, there's a lot of last night I don't remember. No wonder why it's a date rape drug. What I do remember of my first experience is this: I went with my friend to his friends' place. Everyone was going to take Rohypnol and go to the local world-known theme park until it was closed. They always take alcohol before the pills because it's supposed to create a synergy, and the goal was that you were supposed to feel a good buzz (not too strong a buzz). I snorted a pill (no nasty drip and no burn!) and we went on our way. It felt like a different state of drunkeness, or maybe just more inebriated than I've ever been. Beyond relaxed, similar to xanax or, to a lesser extent, valium. I could still understand people and their intentions all right, but I didn't want to talk. My walking didn't seem too bad, but I wasn't paying attention to that. Normally I would be, but it's as they say, it takes away inhibition. I believe I took another one an hour or so later, but I didn't take more alcohol (to keep the synergy, and supposedly keep your memories). Even though I had snorted the first one, it still didn't come on all at once, which seems to be why my memories start to become faded at this point, like a dream. I remember going on a slow, sit-down ride, but my memories end a bit after that point. I think I took a xanax also that night, but I don't think it affected me with a bunch of alcohol and two rohypnols in my system. I do remember spilling a drink on myself, and after we left, getting the driver to pull over so I could throw up... wait! The driver had drank and took some as well! I remember him telling me to watch his driving, but I think I fell asleep... all very dangerous! I was amazed I let that happen. There was about five hours before that memory which I knew I was awake and walking around, but do not remember. Never had I experienced this before. I look around where I had been sleeping and the objects I had with me remind me of brief memories during the lapse. Later that week, I revisted those friends, and found that they had brought a digital camera and a voice recorder. Pictures of me reminded me of that instant, and I could remember it again. They told me I had fun and stumbled around a lot, but I don't remember. It's like someone else had my fun for me. Perhaps if I didn't take so much on my first time, I would have remembered... but this does 'make' you do things you wouldn't do normally. I've always had a laundry list of drugs that I'll never try: PCP, ketamine, crystal meth and crack.  With the exclusion of those 4, I've always been up for anything.  I've been taking Wellbutrin (an SSRI) [Erowid Note: Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is not generally classified as an SSRI because it has only weak SSRI activity] for the past 7 years, but had not been taking it regularly at the time of the experience for about 2 years.  The mix of drugs that I was doing, the adderall, the coke, the diet pills, the alcohol, the weed, and the ecstasy, I'd done before and while the mixture had made me extremely edgy, I didn't feel any overtly negative side effects.This particular night, I was hanging out with a friend of mine who had just returned from being out of the country for 3 weeks.  I had also decided that it was time for me to start taking my anti-depressant again.  I knew that the combination of Wellbutrin and alcohol could cause seizures, but had been drinking heavily on Wellbutrin since I was 18 and besides blacking out a few times (which arguably is something that happens when you go off to college and are away from you parents for the first time ever), I had never had a negative experience.My friend and I started drinking our wine and doing lines when I saw him take a pill out of his drawer and I asked him what it was.  'ecstasy.  you want one?'  he said.  This guy is careful, he has a test kit and thoroughly inspects everything he buys, so I knew that I was getting something safe from him.  But being the reckless person that I am, I never considered that it could be hazardous to take with Wellbutrin.  Once the ecstasy started to kick in, I totally lost control.  I was talking about everything, having auditory hallucinations and felt really really uncomfortable with what was going on in my mind.The next thing I remember is waking up with my friend leaning over me saying, 'I thought I'd lost you.'  I asked him what happened, and he told me that I'd started shaking and stopped breathing.  I've always assumed that this was a seizure, and have since done a little research on the internet on the affects of mixing ecstasy with an SSRI and think that I'm correct in this assumption.  My experience hasn't caused me to stop taking drugs, but it has taught me to look into the safety of mixing more carefully.  I wanted to share this experience because I don't think there is nearly enough information available pertaining to combining ecstasy with SSRI's.  I'm taking Wellbutrin regularly now and since that night have not touched ecstasy and will not do it again.  Mix Carefully!! A while ago I read in a book that Vassopressin was able to counteract the intoxicating effects of alcohol. Recently I was able to procure some Vassopressin over the internet so I decided to test this theory. My friend Ramielrising and I paid a visit to Simones beverage store and got some hard cider and Yukon Jack. We headed back to my house and began drinking. We tried to call otheres to join the festivities but  couldn't get ahold of anyone else. I had a couple shots of Yukon Jack in Ginger Ale followed by four bottles of hard cider.Then it was time for the Vassopressin. I took three inhalations of the drug from the spray bottle. I immediately felt a little rush of my brain kicking in, similar to cocaine but much more mild. We decided to go for a walk. Everything was much funnier than with alcohol alone, I couldn't stop laughing.  I felt more coordinated yet more intoxicated than I had felt before drinking. I had the room spinning effect normally present with high doses of alcohol but with none of the nausea.I woke up this morning and had a hangover, I rarely get hangovers. I wonder if the hangover was caused by the Vassopressin or just dehydration. Over all I did have an enjoyable time but I don't know if it was that much better than alcohol alone. My next expereiment with Vassopressin will be using it while on marijuana. A friend of mine showed up at my apartment one night while I was pretty drunk.  He had some crystal meth and wanted to do some.  I said go for it, and as a matter of fact, let me try some.  I had never snorted meth before, only a pill here and there so I'd never really experienced speed before. Well, it woke me up right out of that drunk buzz.  We did lines every 30 minutes or so for about 4 hours.  By this time, I wasn't drunk at all, and I was feeling pretty good.  The sun was coming up, and my friends had plans to go see some other friends of ours and I was going to go with them.  As I was getting ready, I started to feel sick.  After a while, I realized I wouldn't be able to go.  They left, and all day I was sicker than I'd ever been before in my life.  I almost choked on my own vomit, I swear I was scared there for a second that I was going to die because I couldn't breathe.  It was like getting the wind knocked out of you but it lasted for about 15 minutes.  I finally recovered enough so that I wasn't puking, and went to sleep.  The next day, I was extremely depressed.  I was crying all day long, I mean boo-hooing, which is REALLY unlike me.  I thought something was terribly wrong with me and even dialed some help numbers and talked to some counselors.  I felt like killing myself.  I got through the day somehow and finally went to sleep.  The next day, I had a lingering depression, but nothing like the day before.  I don't know if it was the speed and the alcohol combination that caused such horrible aftereffects (possibly the vomiting was) but if just doing speed was the cause of depression like that, I'm never doing it again. 3:47 amJust took approximately 25 mg of IAP.4:12 amGetting pretty nice head euphoria. Not really speedy, but euphoric. Nose feels tingly. Music euphoria. It is a possible SSRI so I do not know how it is going to affect my DXM trips, but I like what I am seeing thus far. Seems to increase the flow of conversation, but I do not notice any actual mood elevation that comes accustomed to GHB.4:23 amNose tingling has gone away, now it is just head euphoria, music euphoria, and an opening of senses without any visual distortion. I feel good. It does feel a bit like MDMA.4:58 amEuphoria comes in waves, head is tingly and feels good. Like a low dose of MDMA - will experiment with 50 mg next time. I feel open and talkative.5:21 amConsumed some alcohol. I feel very open and empathetic. Feeling really good. Not intense but very nice positive attitude and energy. Not 'let's go out and do something' energy like with GHB but just happy-go-lucky, content with life, talking a bit more than normal, easy to converse, etc. Alcohol definitely adds to the euphoria.6:29 amEuphoria, disinhibition (probably from the alcohol added - very synergistic). I could only imagine what GHB and IAP would do together. The euphoria is amazing - it encompasses my entire head. And I feel more open and talkative. If only this could be marketed as an antidepressant instead of Paxil and Prozac, the world would be a MUCH happier place.6:50 amJust got stoned with AK-47 strain. I can not tell you HOW synergistic IAP is with weed/alcohol - it feels like a good clean MDMA with waves of euphoria all over my head, without much body buzz or intense effects by itself - increases the flow of conversation, it is truly a remarkable substance. I have found the second best thing to GHB. Perhaps even better, if tolerance is not an issue and I see how it goes at higher doses.THC provides an amazing synergy with this drug. I now have a full-body buzz going. The two go hand in hand. I imagine that GHB+IAP+THC would bring about a full-body orgasm, much like MDMA+N2O.Sleep was difficult. I was not able to sleep until 12 hours after ingesting it. It is a lot longer acting than I thought - the alcohol and marijuana may have prolonged the effects, but I doubt it. Sleep, when it came, was normal.  Today I felt fine, and I notice there is no interaction with DXM. Appetite is normal, everything else fine. Since it lasts so long, I probably wouldn't do this more than once a week. Date: May 23, 24 2003Time: 11:40-12:10Location: USA, Illinois just south of ChicagoHalf an hour ago I had a really F'd up encounter with the police. I was driving home from chillin with my buds when I saw the right lane of traffic was blocked by a police officer. He stepped in front of my car and directed me into a parking lot filled with cop cars, civilian cars, and two huge police-task-force like vehicles. I had been going the speed limit, moving with the flow of traffic on a fairly busy road, (U.S. Route 52, Joliet IL) nothing was wrong with my car.What was wrong however was that I was really high, and had most of a 30 pack in my trunk, along with four joints in my cupholder. I'm 17 so its illegal to possess any alcohol. Weed is obviously illegal. There was an empty on the floor, so I kicked it under my seat.My heart was racing like that guy in 'The Telltale-Heart' when the cop said that this was a Driver Safety Inspection. He asked for my license and registration, while giving my car a good look-over, moving around to see in my back seat.I was driving on a ticket so I gave it to him and got my insurance stuff out of my glove box. Thank God I didn't stash anything there. The cop left and I was alone for about 10 minutes (11:49~12:00)It occurred to me that this was a huge breach of my civil rights, but it also occurred that the more contact with the police I made, the bigger the chance that theyd see my cashed-out eyes. I didn't know if he had seen them and was getting a k9 unit right then. I waited for a long ass time and then they pulled a squad car out of the way and waved me forward. The pig gave me back my ticket and let me go. As I approached the officer who gave me my ticket back I could see inside one of the huge task force things, and I saw TVs with pictures of all the surrounding area, including a view on another person waiting in her car. I could see her there perfectly, and if she had tried to hide anything she would have been caught on tape. I had fingered a roach in my pocket, and had thought of hiding it, but thought better of it, thank God again. :) (and I'm not even that religious) This sting type thing was way more sophisticated than anything you'd see on COPS. This was like the really high tech stuff you see on a movie. I can't believe that our country would allow such invasion of privacy, and such an ineffective one at that. If there is a lesson in this it is Keep your shit well hidden when your driving, and take the smaller streets whenever possible. Dont ever talk to the police more than u need 2 even if ur rights are being violated, send a letter instead. Dont freak out and suspect they 'know' u have drugs and are loaded or anything (I did a little of this). Stay safe and outta jail. peace Wish I had found experience reports such as this before last weekend.  I play music professionally in addition to my day gig and had shown up to a gig with a sore back.  While playing this 4-hour gig I met an ordained minister (no shit) who had recently suffered a pretty bad back injury and was prescribed Valium.  We talked; I spoke of my slight (in relation) back soreness.  He offered me a blue 10mg tab which I stuck in my pocket.  I knew I'd have to drive an hour home later that night, and not having any experience with Valium, I wanted to be cautious.  I am a reasonably small-framed guy in my late 20's and have gained a pretty experienced knowledge base of drugs/experiences and also what to not do.  I assumed that I put a reasonable amount of thought into taking the drug.  I saw 2-3 folks swallow a 10mg tab that night.  They had a few beers and seemed in coherent (albeit a bit silly and slurred) shape.  The next night I had another gig and I decided to split the Valium and take 5mg.  Waited about an hour to try and perceive what effects.  Taking it easy.  After the hour passed I began to drink a beer and smoke a bowl (done that every time I've played for 15 years or so).  Felt pretty good yet entirely in control.  Decided to swallow the other 5mg tab maybe 1.5 hours after the initial dose.  A second beer for the 2nd set and following the show shared in a bowl of commercial grade pot and a hot dog.  Felt a little Jell-O like but I wasn't going to drive and felt OK.  Kind of liked it.  Back pain was gone….  Still articulate and in control.  In the 10 minute ride home I began to feel very light headed.  Cold sweat rush feeling.  No good - I think upon arriving home I'll puke and be OK.  My driver stops the car at home and I get out heading for the closest tree (I think).  In retrospect, these 3 substances at this moment likely have my blood pressure akin to a hot, flat soda.  I put my 2 feet on the ground took a step, counter balanced my wobbliness and, reportedly, I collapsed like a wet noodle.  45 minutes later I begin to regain consciousness with 2 large gashes on my temple/eye brow area.  Lots of blood, confusion, scared....wtf did I do?  2 days later I am still confused from the head injury.  I look back and winder if I came close to death.  I don’t recommend this for any self-respective, slight good time seeker – or as a way to combat back pain.  Careful. About 2 months ago I had quite an experience that was both enlightening and frightening at the same time. My friend K and I were supposed to go to a party, and I wasn't sure I was up for it.Naturally, I just sucked it up and went along, and when we got there it only about 7 of us. Myself, K, S, A, B, and two other girls I didnt know. We all went out into the garage and had a cigarette before beginning what would be an insane night.I started out by just having a few cups of Everclear (190 proof) and orange juice. After the third one I was pretty plastered. Now in the past, I have mixed Weed and Alc at the same time, and it's never really turned out that good. My vision blurs very badly after just 3 or 4 beers so you can imagine what the effects would be if I mixed weed with it.We went downstairs and shot pool until B announce that they were going to smoke a bowl of 'some really good shit' in the garage. I went out there, very drunkedly I might add, and plopped down in a lawn chair. After one bowl I was just completely gone. I decided in my stupid head that I should smoke another, so that I did.I remember turning around to my friends and saying 'I can't come back now. This is it,' and walking out the garage door to the drive way. I lit a cigarette and admired the world around me. The first thing I experience was a sort of 'night to day' transition. It was slightly raining outside, and I just felt like it was daytime. It's hard to explain, but it's sort of like flashing a camera in the dark - you see things in the light very quickly, but you know it's dark. I became very dizzy and lay face down on the driveway. The dizzyness I probably account to the cigarette, it often gives me a funny feeling in my brain when I'm high.I became a puddle on the driveway. My brain connected itself to other parts of itself that were not meant to be and I believe I had a mental breakdown. The world appeared so incredibly beautiful and intreguing, and yet I couldn't help but feel sad. I started to cry and sob and choke and got on all fours and vomited four times onto the pavement. When I got up the entire world was a haze. It spun and spun, and didn't stop. A car passed by, and at the same time I saw a reflection of it on the rain-soaked road. I pictured the world as a single plane, and I believe that the world had become flat and stretched on for millions of miles.I went inside the house to try and find everyone but I could not. I didn't know where they went, and I completely and totally freaked out. I thought that perhaps the armageddon had occurred, the eastern sky had split open, and Jesus had come to take all of the Christians and I was left here because I was not one. I started to cry again and felt my stomach drop millions of miles.I crawled up the stairs into a guest bedroom and pulled my clothes off and got in bed, feeling ripped in half. This is the way I imagine it:Marijuana, obviously, is a drug that slows me down; while Alcohol (in me), speeds me up. I felt like my mind was being ripped in half, and a song by Radiohead came to my head (Everything in Its Right Place) where he sings the line 'There are two colors in my head' repeatedly.The darkness engulfed me and I don't remember really anything of what happened after that except getting up once to use the bathroom, and the agonizing feeling of the world spinning. The axis of the earth had pierced me and I was clinging to it, watching myself spin.I passed out at what I would assume to be 3am, and awoke at 9 or so by my friend K, and explained to him what had happened. He told me that I freaked out in the garage one time and tried to clamp a plastic bottle of paint thinner into a vise because 'I knew what I was doing, I do it all the time'.I got dressed, put on my shoes and went downstairs where K handed me a Ritalin to help me wake up and recover from what had happened. I stepped outside, and in the morning haze, I stood with my left arm hugging myself, smoking a cigarette and looking at the captivating stormy blue sky.Words of advice: be careful before you mix drugs, especially ones that will counteract the other; you may be in for a wild ride. This event had proven to be life-changing to me, and I haven't mixed alcohol and marijuana to this day. Hi!I had this experience last saturday, that i HAVE to share with everyone. I have tried 2CB severeal times before, and though fun, it has never intrigued me, like stronger psychactives such as LSD. That is, untill last saturday.My companions and me had planned on a hard night og drinking, and never expected to have the time of our lives. We had been drinking since 6 o'clock in the evening, and was quite drunk, when i located a couple of 200 mg capsules og BZP in my drawer. We where four persons drinking in my cellar(I have a really nice cellar for tripping), and three of us dosed with the BZP. After about one hour or so, we where all quite stimulated, and where really silly. It was about 11.30 in the night at this point. We decided a small amount of 2CB, would be just the thing to get us in the right mood. All three of us(the last friend, dont do any psychoactives) put 25 mg 2CB (hydrobromide salt=20 mg 2CB hydrochloride form) in a capsule. We immediately went to a bar and smoked some skunk on the way. We arrived around 12.30 and where all feeling the 2CB alot. We could not hide the fact, that we where REALLY affected by drugs, as we where talking QUITE loud. The paintings on the walls, started coming alive, and turden into the most beautifull visuals ever(not strongest, but most beautifull). We had a couple of drinks and where extremely ecstatic. We just sat there, like a couple of MDMA heads and looked at all the beauty of the bar. After one hour we went to the nearby club. We peaked of the 2CB at this point. The line, before we got in, was SO amusing. We all just stood there and looked at the shifting, liquid and extremely vivid hallucinations. The body was so pleasantly stimulated, that it aws impossible to describe. It was like a 10x MDMA buzz. When we got in, the light and sound simply took over my soul. I started dancing(i usually hate dancing) by myself and was carried away. We just stood in the hallway, between the two areas, and grooved to the beats. It was the most ecstatic feeling i have ever experienced at this point. I was so happy and i just loved my friends etc. We went upstairs to a chillout area and has a lot of gingerale-vodka drinks, which where nice. We just sat there talking to everyone while having the time of our lives. Now and then, when a groovy song was being played, we went dancing. Every time the sound and light took over and we became one, with the whole dance scene. The visuals where very nice throughout the evening. Never to intense, and never boring. Simply perfect at all times!! I went home around 4.30 in the morning and had i very nice walk home. It was a 30 min walk home, but the time just flew by, as i reflected over the experience i had had. I slept quite good when i got home(which i account to the large amounts of alcohol and some marihuana).All in all: I cannot begin to desribe how much i enjoy the BZP-2CB combo. It has a very special synergy, that cannot be described as a mix of the effects, but more like its very own. The BZP enhances the psychedelic effects of the 2CB(with 40 mg pure 2CB i did not have this strong visuals), and the 2CB brings out the emphatogenic effects of BZP. The body load was minor, but i had a body buzz, that resembled that of opiates. I will try this combinations again VERY soon!!RegardsVoorhees My friends & I have an understanding of how GHB works and how much to take.  I have never had a problem myself, although I became involed in one at my house party.5 AM. Everything is going well, and slowing down from a good night of music.  One of our DJ's (who had been drinking beer all night) thought it would be nice to dose himself.  None of us noticed him using/drinking the GHB or we would have stopped him. I didn't even know he had taken any... Until one of friends asked me to see what was wrong with him?  I'm not sure how much he took, (he has an ego problem) but I'm sure it was more than 3 water bottle caps of very strong G.He had his shirt off and was very hot.  He was walking around making strange noises and had a 'Blank' but crazy look on his face.  He couldn't or wounldn't talk, and this got me worried.He sat in a chair, pulled down his pants and underware and defecated in the chair...This really sucked since I had to clean it.I've seen others 'OD' as they say.  Which means you put the person in bed and watch the breathing (which will be very long & deep).  Also, turn the person on their side to keep them from choking on vomit.The next step was to try and get him to go to sleep.  He was fighting the GHB effects and us.  It took about 4 of us to 'Over Power' him onto the floor where we had a bed waiting for him.I told his friends that he would be alright once he started sleeping.The next morning he woke up, feeling fine, but not remembering anything about the night before.  He said he would never use GHB again...We all hope this is true.As for my friends & me, we use GHB very carefully.  It is a God send for people who use it correctly! My Version: at 9:00 was down at the beach, chilling, lighting a fire and enjoying the company of a few very intimate friends.  We were laughing and telling stories and I was very social for the first half of the bottle.  Then the rapid consumption of alcohol caught up with me, I remember becoming very silent and chugging a lot of whiskey very fast.  Next, I'm standing over the whiskey bottle guarding it from police officers who tell me to put the fire out and throw away the bottle, I remember agreeing to both things.  Next thing I know I'm walking to my friends car.  Then I'm eating pizza somewhere.  Then I wake up in a very familiar place, my friends basement and I feel pretty good, I have a vague hangover, but even more strangely no recollection of how I got to where I was.  I calmly walked up the stairs to my friends room and threw socks at him until he woke up and I demanded a full account of last night.My friend's version:I confirmed this story with a few friends so I have a fairly vivid account of what happened.  I also have seen a video displaying a lot of my behaviour during the night.We were sitting at the beach and at about 930-10:00 my friends noticed I'd become very quiet, somebody picked up my bottle and asked if they could have some and I agreed but when they picked it up they said, 'OH my god, he drank it all.'  It was empty.The police arrived and very nicely asked us to put out our fire and told us that the beach wasn't very safe these days, people were using bear mace to mug people (note: I once got bear maced while drunk: not fun.)  When the police asked me to throw away the bottle I argued with them and continued saying, 'the bottle's not mine, it's empty...' after a few circular arguments I finally had the good sense to pick up the bottle, which I was very obviously guarding.  Then we went a pizza place, and I hugged some girls who appeared to be total strangers (I later discovered, quite awkwardly, that the girls were my a buddy's little sister and her friends... oops.).  Then my friends decided quite rightly that I was too drunk to stay home by myself and needed to be watched so they put me in a car and drove me to my friends house.While in the car I threw up out of the passenger seat window onto the side of the car and all over my arm.  I also tried to open the door and get out while moving at about 70km per hour.When me and a few friends arrived at my friends house I spent a few hours mumbling and vomitting and then passed out on the floor.  My friends were kind enough to put pillows under and around me.  I slept very deeply.The video:A few shots of us chatting on the beach, I am talkative for the first bit.  Then the next clips are at the pizza place, where despite being in a public place I wander around making faces at people with glazed eyes and I continually stumble into things.  I look, in short, like the village drunk.  The next footage are some lovely clips of me vomitting onto the side of my friends toyota.  Then some pictures of me falling into some girls.  Then this was possibly the most funny clip on there.  Back at my friends house I was lying on the floor, and I stood up with the intention of going to the bathroom, but I was very weak so I needed a chair to stand up, I grabbed a chair to help myself up, pulled the chair over onto myself and toppled backwards, I somehow found my feet but immediately stumbled into three bar stools and knocked them all out, still somehow on my feet I then fall into a wall and fall over.  Every piece of the furniture lay on the ground with me...  DOSE: 1 tablet oral MDMA (pill / tablet) \\xa0 \\xa0  oral Alcohol - Beer/Wine (liquid)            BODY WEIGHT:   150 lb         Note:1. I did not take medication 2 weeks prior to this experience. 2. I have explored many various psychoactives in the past. 3. I am a mellow individual with very little stress. This particular pill was not tested to be 100% mdma, but I have tried many mdma pills in the past that were proven to be pure so I know what the feeling is like (although I am aware other chemicals carry almost identical effects) Mindset: Happy about getting another mdma experience, anticipating the well-known effects, and eager to experience them with my girlfriend/partner who has never tried it before. Setting: A clean, quiet, and comfortable living room/bedroom. No interruption. In the presence of my trusted girlfriend and my Trip sitter who was also there watching television in another room. Experience: My partner and I swallowed the pills at the same time, both having only eaten once that day, 5 hours before taking the pills. 2+ hours after consuming the mdma, we both felt a complete nothing. Rather disappointed I went and got a light beer for my partner and I to share. We both drank the beer quickly. Another 30 minutes later we felt nothing. After we decided the tablet wasn't any good, we both drank another beer.Before I knew what was happening I was shot into an exhilarating peak. The standard physical side effects were noticed along with the empathetic effects so commonly reported. Soon after I came on the experience, my partner began to feel immediate effects also. For the next 30 minutes of the peak, it was great, like a standard MDMA 'roll.' My partner and I then walked to my room to sit on my bed and talk and show affection. Something strange then happened to the both of us, and we only realized it when it was over. Suddenly we both started crying as the peak became so intense it was shocking. Our eyes went through severe nystagmus, and through a blurry focus, we stared into each other's eyes repeating delirious phrases of love. It was as if we were caught in a time warp or a loop that prevented our thoughts from leaving the feelings of love and each other. I did not experience one thought aside from my concentration on her. I did not know anything even existed; I even lost thought of physical feeling. I couldn't feel the tears in my eyes, or my body on the bed. The next thing we both remember we are sitting on our bed holding each other, now in the presence of my trip sitter. Definitely a unique experience, although I am not sure I want to be in that position again as it was pretty frightening. The next day I had a light headache and I was restless from the night before. Many people report feeling depressed with a longing for the feelings you experience on mdma - This time, surprising, it was not the case. The next day had a brilliant positive energy flowing throughout it. I had a heightened appreciation for everything I was involved in. I became more respectful to everyone I encountered that following day. Even though I was abnormally happy I felt as though it was pure and real not residing effects from a drug. Note: I did not test the pill at all. Since I have never encountered this experience from mdma, I am apt to blame it on [something other than mdma  --editor]. Overall: It seems almost impossible to explain these remarkable feelings through words that feel so empty... The climax of my trip was not only mind-blowing, shocking, and thrilling; it has become a very meaningful part of my life that has even furthered my interest in exploring my mind. I bought 10g high quality 5X extract. I had never done salvia before. I used up three whole grams with no effects at all, even though I knew the stuff was good since it sent everybody else into outer-space.Then I tried it after having three small beers (approx. 1 liter 4% beer in total), and I finally broke on through. Used exactly the same amount, method etc. as before. People might try a little alcohol if they have trouble getting any effect from Salvia. I have listed on this page my personal experiences with different drug combinations.  If your curious about a certain combo but arent sure if it's dangerous or not, then it might help to see that i didn't die from it and what someone else thought of it.  please be advised - i am an undergrad psychobiology student, not a doctor. all of the information on this page is for informational purposes only. remember that even though i survived all of these interactions with only temporary after-effects, not everyone will react the same. (i have had an exceptionally good track record of health my entire life) recreational drug use is still very dangerous and is not for everybody!!!!the purpose of this page is to share some of the knowledge that i have gained in the last five years of drug experimentation. there seems to be very few web pages offering information on radical drug combinations and if i can save someone out there grief and/or money by sharing my experiences and mistakes, then i'd rather do so. LSD and Ketaminek while tripping is an excelent way to boost your trip and take it to another level. bumps are good, but be careful to not overdo it. id say two lines maximum. you do not want to go into a hole! a k hole tripping is not the same as one normally. a normal k hole can be an enjoyable, profound expirience when done in a safe setting. you are much more concious and have a hieghtened sensory awareness while in a hole on lsd. on new years 2001 i was on two geltabs (equal to about 2 1/2-3 paper hits of lsd) and did four lines of k during my peak. it felt like a half hour long whip it that i just wanted to end. it felt really cool at first but after it didn't stop i began to really dislike it and went on a bad one. after the k wore off i was so sick of tripping i took a couple of xantax's to pass out. i didnt trip for about a month afterward.LSD and Mushroomsworks great for me, you get the best of both worlds in your trip. but this has the tendency to make people (with weak stomachs) sick. drop the acid first then eat the shrooms slowly over a period of a half hour or vomitaing may follow.LSD and Cocainenot really an enjoyable combination. the coke pull you out of the trip but at the same time doesnt really feel like coke. you get the downside of coke but not the good. in my opinion, its a waste of coke. however, smoking a coke laced bowl of weed while tripping isnt bad. then again, when isnt it fun to smoke a laced bowl?LSD and Ecstasya fun combo. you can alter the times you take each drug in order to have different expiriences. taking the roll/s at the same time as the acid will ease you into the trip and can keep you from coming down hard on the roll. taking the roll in the middle of your trip is good to. id recommend you dont take acid in the middle of your roll because if youre tripping on acid when your coming down from the roll, the comedown will be worse. my worst trip ever was in oct of 2000. i had dropped 5 rolls and was ready to drop a couple hits. i was so fucked up i didnt notcie that i had eaten an entire five strip. when i came down i felt the worst ever. yuck :( i havent rolled since then.LSD and Alcoholnot really fun to do at the same time. drinking while tripping can make you sick. drinking before trpping is okay, but i wouldnt have more than two drinks after dropping the acid.Cocaine and Ketamineyuck! you're disgusting for even mentioning it!Cocaine and Ecstasygood if your rolls are dirty. if your rolls are pure than the coke can make you come down from the roll and not offer anything in return. see above on lacing bowls ;)Cocaine and Alcoholin my opinion, the perfect club combo. just do them in equal amounts. one line = 1 1/2 to 2 drinks.Cocaine and Mushroomssee coke and lsdEcstasy and Ketaminereally fun, especially on clean rolls. dont overdo the k unless your in a safe environment.Ecstasy and Alcoholif you want to havbe the best roll of your life get pissdrunk before you roll. but be careful cause you will be a mess. dont drink after dropping the roll cause you will most likely feel sick/ vomit.Alcohol and Ketamineits oay, but nothing special. i have better uses for k.GHB and Cannabisjust like drinking and smoking.GHB and AlcoholDON'T ASK!!!!!! Last night was my first experience with a recreational dose of codeine, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed. I used the cold water extraction to obtain a clear, pale pink solution from one packet of OTC 'chemadeine' pills, each containing 8mg codeine phosphate and 500mg paracetamol. I had first intended to drink all of this, but on second thoughts I decided to err on the side of caution, mainly because I wasn't certain that all of the paracetamol had been removed. I have OD'ed on paracetamol before, and let me tell you all it's a horrible horrible experience.So at about 10:30pm I mixed half the codeine solution (roughly 100mg codeine phosphate) with some coke and drank. The taste wasn't bad at all, just a slightly bitter edge to the coke. Slight effects were felt within 15 minutes, at which point I lay down on the couch and put Air's 'premieres symptoms' album in the stereo. In another 15 minutes I was definitely feeling the effects of the drug, although at this stage they weren't particularly pleasant: dizziness, heavy body feeling and a slight headache (strange given I'd just eaten half a pack of headache pills). I decided that a nice cool bath would be great (it's the middle of summer down here in australia), so I started filling the bathtub, pouring myself a strong whisky and soda while I waited. Lying back in the bath sipping my drink was when the first real effects of the codeine hit me, suddenly everything seemed just right: the temperature of the water, the position of my body, the soft light from the candles reflecting off the ripples on the water…mmmm =) I had a great time just lying there blissing out, although I did notice that it was disturbingly easy to forget to breath. Eventually (at about 11:30 I think) I decided to leave the bath for a minute and go smoke a cone of some reportedly very nice sensi. It look me a long time to actually achieve this though, because I found that wandering about my darkened house was SO SO pleasurable that it was difficult to actually force myself to get out my bong and gear. By this time I was in a seriously great mood, my body was feeling amazing. That whisky was just what I needed.In the end I managed to get myself established on my back porch with bong, lighter and a cone of weed, with a small pinch of salvia 5X on top. I don't smoke weed very often, and that fact combined with the extreme potency of the buds put me on another planet. At first the combination of the weed and the codeine was magical. I went to lay back on the couch and put on another Air album, and it was fantastic. I got this amazing glowing sensation travelling in waves up and down my body, and I found that moving around just made it better. I was experiencing some pretty strong euphoria, coming close to a medium quality pill (but in a different way, much more cozy) and hugging myself felt really really great. After Air finished I put on Infected Mushroom's 'Classical Mushroom' album. This album blows me away even when I'm straight, but on any sort of drug it is completely mind-blowing. Although I didn't feel particularly energetic, I couldn't resist the urge to dance, which was fun but not in the way that dancing on pills is fun. While this was happening, I seemed to be sliding deeper and deeper into a drugged out state. After a while the codeine's effects became only very slightly noticable, and I was left with a very heavy stoned feeling, like when I'm really drunk and I smoke a joint of some good hydro... all I could do was lie down and zone out on the couch journeying deep into the incredible music. I must have fallen asleep at some point because suddenly infected mushroom was over and the last song of the Air cd was playing again. I struggled to my feet and dragged myself to bed, feeling very heavilly drugged out. Laying down on the bed brought back a bit of the cozy euphoria I had had earlier, but I was too tired to fully enjoy it. I looked at the clock: 2:30am (4 hours after drinking the codeine) then quickly fell asleep. Woke up at 9 this morning with a heavy 'stone-over', went back to sleep, woke up again 1 hour later feeling slightly more alert. This was a great experience, although next time I probably won't be so hasty to pull out the bong. The weed seemed to overwhelm the more subtle effects of the codeine. The alcohol went well though, it was a good way to boost a relatively small dose up to a very nice level. I wouldn't have more than one or two drinks though, because even after one drink I got fairly dizzy and unsure on my feet. I was glad to find however that nausea was largely absent, I had only a slight bit after drinking a glass of water way too fast (my mouth was soooo dry.) I still have another 100mg sitting in the fridge, and I have a feeling it wont be long before I'm down at the chemists again... Overall a very positive experience, deliciously cozy and happy... I can imagine a lot of hugging would've happened had there been anyone there to hug. Oh and the paracetamol didn't bother me at all, except maybe for the slight headache at the very start (high doses of paracetamol give me headaches, but I can't say for sure that it was definitely what caused this one). We decided to do Salvia in pairs of two in his room just so we could do it in complete silence. He had soft Trance/Fantasy music on. I went downstairs to play some pool. Down there I took a very small shot of Bacardi Lemon. I played pool for a while. Then my friend and I went upstairs to the room where the other two guys were having a session. I went in the room, sat down by a water bong, and my friend packed it very densely and blazed the Salvia. Without talking or thinking, I exhaled all the breath out of my body. I put my mouth to the top, and sucked hard and let go of the choke of the bong. I followed a procedure that I made. I sucked in deep and let it out my nose. Then, I sucked in the second time, and let it out through my nose, but this time, I let out less than what I took in. The third time, I sucked in hard occasionally letting go of the choke, and I exhaled a about 75% of what I inhaled. I continued this until my lungs were fully occupied. Each time I would take in a 100% and let out 75% through my nose. This way, I still had 25% in me every time. The 25% gradually increased at each inhalation. Hence, at the end, my lungs were full and I would hold the smoke in for around 20 seconds and let it go slowly. This was the first set. I followed the same set of procedure three times=three sets. The last hit of the third set: I took it in deep and held the smoke in for about 20 seconds. When I let out the smoke, I just fell on my back and started laughing wildly. I felt so emotionally aroused. I could feel the tips of my fingers on my chest. They were unusually cold. Stage 1: I felt like I was dazed & tipsy. I felt like I was in an earthquake because everything started to move & shake. I was laughing so hard my friends pulled me up from the floor and layed me on the bed. I stared up at the glow-in-dark stars and I looked around the whole room like I was in heaven. I felt so emotionally stimulated it was unbelievable. Stage 2: I had no control ove my body or my thoughts. I heard everything but did not know how to respond. I merely gazed at my surroundings in awe. Then I started crying. Yes...I started crying like a baby...like 'There was no tomorrow' as my friend later told me. I still do not know why exactly it is that I was crying so much. I had a wide mix of emotions. Happiness, Joy, Wonder, Fear, Anger, Empathy, and Sadness. I had no control over things I could normally control. Stage 3: I began to talk a little bit, but I was still halfway inside the vortex of this Salvia. I was sexually stimulated. I moved around, but I fiddled with things. I questioned everything, and I was paranoid. I looked around like a child and touched a lot of things. Stage 4: REALIZATION. I had gone to sleep, and woke up the next morning. I felt hazy and like I had been awake for a long long time. I could not recollect the wide range of emotions I had the previous night. I came home and started writing this. BAAM. It hit me. As I was writing this, I realized and understood what happened to me. I HAD FLASHED THROUGH MY WHOLE LIFE YESTERDAY. I RECREATED MY OWN LIFE. I was in awe in the first stage. This is when I was a very small child in the world. I just looked around. And in stage two, I was crying. 'CRYING LIKE A BABY' because I was a baby. I felt all sorts of emotions, and did not know where to let them out and how to react/relate to them. Just like a baby who would not know how to deal with emotions. In stage 3, I began to talk just as a child would start talking after a certain age. I questioned things, fiddled with things, and became paranoid just as one would be when he/she is a child. I was sexually stimulated just as many teenagers. This was my trip to heaven and back. My friends told me a lot later that I had forgotten, and from that I could recollect what had happened. My entire life just flashed in my own self yesterday. During all of this I was only semi-conscious. My body was there, but my mind was in other realms. Salvia is like a boon of the gods. Its sacredness is not to be taken lightly.  DOSE: 4  oral Alcohol - Beer/Wine (liquid) \\xa0 10 hits smoked Cannabis - Hash \\xa0            BODY WEIGHT:   45 kg         About a year ago I went to the gynecologist to get a little laceration treated and he prescribed a drug basically compounded of centella asiatica (Gotu Kola). As far as I know, this substance is usually administered to heal small wounds and, as I found out, can have unexpected results if mixed with other substances.So I started my medication, which consisted of one dose every two weeks for a period of four to six months, topically administered (although I don't recall the exact number of grams in every dose of centella). It so happened that during my treatment I went out partying one night. I had had my last dose about five days before and to be honest it didn't even cross my mind that having drugs during the treatment could have any effects.Anyway, I went out clubbing with a couple of friends. We arrived at our favourite club about 1 in the morning and I had my first beer for the night. I had a second and a third beer during the course of the night and everything was fine. We were all dancing and having a great time. So about 4 in the morning I had a fourth beer and while I was drinking that and dancing I had about 10 drags of hash (rolled with tobacco). Soon after that I started feeling that a different state of conciousness was starting to settle in, to blend into the slightly drunk dizziness I was already feeling. It started as some kind of hyperconciousness--I was extremely aware of every movement, every sound, every look and every little gesture around. There was also some paranoia to it... I started thinking that people had noticed the state I was in and were making fun of me. Then suddenly the feeling changed.I found myself standing in the middle of a dancing crowd and having a bombardment of thoughts and ideas coming into my mind. The sensation is difficult to explain. I would have an idea and then that image would give rise to five different ones and those five would equally multiply by five, until I was unable to keep track of my own thoughts. Of course, none of these ideas had any sense or were attached to reality in any way. It was pretty much a flow of intellectual images--there was logic to them in a certain way but I think this 'logic' was just an illusion. Unfortunately I am unable to recall any of the ideas that crossed my mind during those minutes; in fact, even as I was experiencing this I couldn't remember the ideas after a few seconds. The flow was so fast I guess there was no space left in mind to use memory. This is the weirdest sensation I've ever had in my life. In a way I wasn't really thinking about anything BUT I was thinking about all this exponentially multiplying ideas at the same time. And, there still was a little spot in the back of my mind that was watching all this chaos from the outside, recording all the sensations and keeping the 'real me' alive and concious. It was an amazing and frightening experience. Basically, I was scared not to be able to get OUT of that state. I remember thinking (in one of the free spaces in the back of my mind) that maybe that was what being crazy might be like. But at the same time it was fascinating. The height of it came when the club was about to close. My favorite song was on and this was when I had my 'mystical' experience, to call it some way. I was dancing, completely carried away by the music and the flow of ideas was starting to slow down. Suddenly I felt _I_ was music. I was the song that was playing. I completely lost track of myself. This is really hard to explain and actually I don't really remember how it felt like exactly, I just remember that I felt it. It wasn't like getting out of my body... it was more like my body was part of the music, without losing its physical entity. Probably hard to understand, I know.Anyway, this is NOT something I would recommend doing, especially because the feelings of paranoia, craziness and loss of control of my mind was absolutely overwhelming. On the other hand, I have no idea if this state could be reproduced. There had been previous times during my medication that I had had alcohol and hash with no such effects or any effects whatsoever apart from those I would normally expect. But it really was something I will never forget. I've always been a really good girl.  Before my junior year in high school, I never drank alcohol and I certainly never pictured myself smoking weed.  I worked at a restaurant with a lot of varying types of people.  We had a Christmas party and I decided to go with my friends.  It was really blizzardy that year and I remember that we were packed like sardines in the back seat of my friend's car.  Everyone met at the restaurant before driving to the bowling alley so that we could eat some of the free food that they made for us.  I was fighting with my boyfriend over his addictive marijuana habit and when we walked into the restaurant, I knew that he had been smoking with his friends even though he tried to deny it.  I just sat there in stony silence, angry that he had betrayed my trust.  My friend had mentioned something about smoking some weed and I decided that I had to be in on the action.  When we went out to the car, my friend rolled a joint and started to pass it around.  We sat in the parking lot and finished off the joint.  Only myself and two of my friends chose to smoke.  We left for the bowling alley and on the way I noticed that the friend sitting next to me was sipping on a cup.  I asked what was in it and he told me that it was straight gin.  He asked if I wanted a swig and I said sure.  I was feeling a little bit different from the weed, but I've heard that it doesn't affect you that much the first few times that you smoke.  I took a deep gulp from my friend's cup and I almost choked on the contents.  The alcohol burned my throat and mouth and I wanted to throw it back up until my friend handed me his chaser, a packet of Capri Sun.  When we got to the bowling alley parking lot, my friend rolled another joint and when we were finished smoking it, we went inside.My best friend's little sister was there and she had a drink in her hand.  I swiped it from her and took a deep gulp, realizing much too soon that this concoction was half Powerade, half alcohol.  She just looked at me as I took two more swigs after that.  She asked me if I was trying to get drunk and I said yes.  I'd never been drunk before and I didn't even think about being hung over or anything.  I wasn't prepared for it and I hadn't eaten anything at all that day.  I just knew that I was mad at my boyfriend and that I wanted to forget everything for one night.By 11:30 I was feeling very light headed.  We were glow bowling and so the room was very dark.  There were pulsing lights and lasers and there was incredibly loud music.  I remember standing on a speaker with M and singing along with one of my favorite songs and dancing.  Me, dancing!  I was shy...I still am shy.  But I was dancing.  I had long ago reached the point where I was decently buzzed, but midnight, I was positively wasted.  To make matters worse, I kept going outside to partake in the smoking of a joint.  I must have gone out four or five times, after a while, I just lost count.  I don't smoke cigarettes either, but I went through about half of M's pack.  I remember one moment very vividly, I asked my friend Deb for her lighter and I realized that I was practically slumped on the table.  My voice sounded like I was talking with my lips closed.  My eyes were reduced to slits.  I realized that I looked ridiculous and that I should stop.  That's when I felt nauseous.The nausea hit me while we were still in the bowling alley.  I threw up everywhere, it just exploded from deep inside of me.  I was running to the bathroom and I remember vomiting on the carpet.  The lights slanted and seemed to want to hurl me to the ground.  I made it to the bathroom for another round, only this time, I really had nothing left in my stomach.  I was dry heaving and it hurt so much.  I remember looking into the toilet bowl and seeing green (that was the color of the last Powerade that M and I had shared) and wanting to vomit again.  I blacked out over the toilet and was revived by my best friend (L) only to find my hand hanging in the vomit and water.  L was crying and I was just laying there on the floor.  'I want to sleep' I said repeatedly.  I didn't know it was bad to pass out like that. They made me leave the bowling alley and I sat outside in the cold with my boyfriend (J) and L on either side of me.  When my head dropped, they made me get up and walk the length of the plaza that we were in.  I threw up on J's shoes.  My manager came out and gave me some 7UP to try and settle my stomach.  I threw up on his shoes too.  I felt bad.  I kept apologizing.  I told my boyfriend that I loved him a million times.  I hugged him for what seemed like an hour before I left and tried to kiss him (which is disgusting when I think about it now) and he just pushed me into the car.  I cried for a minute and then tried to focus on my breathing.  I couldn't see anything and my neck felt completely loose.  I couldn't lift my head.  My arms were plastered to my sides and my legs felt like rocks.  The only good thing about the ride home was that I got the front seat.  I remember rolling down the window and hanging my head out and throwing up.  Then I turned to my friend R (who was driving) and told him that I had just puked out his window.  I blacked out after that and didn't wake up till I was trying to walk through L's house to her room.  I passed out on the floor and didn't move all night.THe next morning, I woke up and wanted to vomit.  I held it in because her parents had been asleep and didn't know what happened and I was embarassed.  I had to work that day at 4 in the afternoon.  I got up at 12.  L told me to eat, but the sight of food brought bile to the back of my throat and I refused.  All day at work I had a headache and I was really slow.  Looking at food and getting nauseous was bad in my line of work, but I made it.  That night, I collapsed in my own bed like a ton of bricks.I recommend not drinking to get wasted.  It's not fun to wake up with your head splitting into a million pieces and constant bile in the back of your throat.  Make sure that you have time to rest the next day...make sure you eat!  DRY HEAVES SUCK!!  Don't drink if you're depressed because it only makes you want to drink more and drink it faster in order to get rid of that empty lost feeling that you have inside.  And pace yourself.  That's all the stuff that I didn't do.  But I've learned. I guess I should mention that by profession I am a Bodyworker / Kinesiologist and my interest in energy systems within and outside the human body continues to intrigue me.  With this line of work, I have tended to become very sensitive to my own reactions as well as others'.  I used cannabis regularly as a means of enhancing my regular meditation, physical (combined with stretching) and mental relaxation routines.  I recently moved to South Korea and have since been looking at alternative forms of entertainment as alcohol can become very boring after a while. I stumbled on fresh ginseng which is used in various dishes here.  Previously, I had only tried Ginseng teas and they had no effect on me whatsoever.The fist time in ingested fresh ginseng root I was knocked by the power of it. I was in a brightly lit, sit on the floor type restaurant with my husband eating a local specialty, chicken and ginseng soup (Samgye Tang).  Only a few minutes after eating it, my body began to warm up considerably, I felt like I was literally expanding out of my skin.  This was followed by an intense heat building at the top of my head (around the fontanel on the top of the skull, this point in acupuncture is called the 'Gateway to Heaven', a point that connects you to the universal energy (as it has been explained to me).  My head was growing upwards and outwards and it was quite disorientating as well as being a very euphoric experience.  This continued for over 30 minutes before subsiding into a simple feeling of wellbeing.  As I was in public place, I didn't have the opportunity to use meditation techniques to explore this phenomenon.  Walking home from the restaurant, I was light bodied and happy and this feeling of wellbeing stayed with me for the next couple of days.I didn’t get the same reaction the next few times I ate this soup, just a residual joyous feeling of wellbeing, however, recently I drank another local specialty and had another “hit” of ginseng power.  The alcohol was a homemade type of cloudy rice wine (Tongtong Ju) which had raw fresh ginseng chopped up in it.  I am a great lover of this alcohol as it gives me a body-buzz similar to the one experienced when I’m stoned.  A friend and I were sharing the brew over lunch and we both experienced similar reactions to it, though he mentioned feeling more drunk than anything else.  Again I felt the expanding of my body as my temperature rose, and the euphoric sensations.  My head was less affected this time, in fact, I was very clear in thinking, and felt very powerful.  As a result, I ended up on a 12 hour drinking binge after lunch, with various people and felt I was on a happy high the whole time, no matter how many different types of alcohol I was consuming.  I woke up the next morning, totally hangover free (not to mention money free!) and feeling on top of the world, this again lasted for a few days.As yet I have not bought fresh raw ginseng because of the expense but it is definitely an amazing root to explore if one is sensitive to it!  A warning though, if you have high blood pressure or are prone to heart palpitations, give it a miss as you might get a nasty reaction to it. They say you can always tell that a junkie is lying if his lips are moving. I wonder why that is. Last year, my uncle died from a heroin overdose. For years he tried to break the habit. I remember being at my grandparents' house when I was six years old and watching him go through heroin withdrawal. At that point he had been using for twenty years. It was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen. I sat there horrified as I watched him convulse and vomit up slime. His eyes rolled into the back of his head and he looked as if he were dead. The stench was worse than that of burning flesh. It was one of the most disgusting things I have ever seen in my entire life. I was terrified. Last Christmas Eve I was visiting some relatives up on the mountain near my city. My aunt and uncle, along with my father, are all heavy drinkers and drug users. My aunt's face was bruised and stitched from a fall in the bathroom one night in New York City when she was drunk. As the evening grew on, my mother and I began to get tired. It was Christmas and we wanted to go home. My father, who was belligerently wasted on God knows what at the time, refused to leave. So we left him, but before we did we made him promise that he would not attempt to drive home. Well, we arrived home safely and at around 12:00 am we all went to bed. At approximately 3:30 in the am, my mother and myself awoke to a series of rings at the doorbell. We answered the door, but no one was there. Thirty minutes later, the same thing. This time, when we opened the door, my father staggered inside, covered in his own blood and piss. Turns out that he had come home, slipped on a 'piece of ice' in the garage (keep in mind, we had no ice in our garage), knocked himself out, got up, went the wrong direction, slammed his head into a desk and knocked himself out again. My mother had to take him to the emergency room and left me there to clean up the blood that had dripped onto the kitchen floor and wash his urine/blood soaked clothes. He got sixty stitches and suffered from internal bleeding in his eyes. You see, my father has a long, long history of drug use. When he was fifteen, he got strung out on amphetamines. From there, he moved to heroin, then to coke, then back to heroin, then to alcohol, and now it's a mix of alcohol and whatever else he can get his hands on. I think it's fair to say that my dad is and always will be a drug addict.  My family has a long history of drug addicts. In fact, I couldn't think of one person off the top of my head that isn't a drug addict or a recovering drug addict, except for myself and my Grandpa Bill. I don't know what it is. I guess we're just cursed. Drugs have destroyed my family and it hurts so badly when I see another person that I care about fall into the trap. Like, when my sister was 15 she overdosed on Ketamine at school. She put herself in to a massive K-Hole and her heart rate dropped down to 35 bpm. She was only fifteen years old!!! We're very fortunate that she didn't die. I was shocked when I came home from school that day and saw my sister lying on the couch, looking very pale and very dead. The only reason she had been released from the hospital so early is because my dad is a trained professional in the Drug Abuse field. Ha. Talk about irony. For the rest of the week she was so fucked up that I had to go to the bathroom with her and hold her on the toilet just to she wouldn't fall off. It is scary to see someone that close to you be in a state like that. She is 19 now and still hasn't stopped using. She has totally screwed herself over! She just violated her probation AGAIN by failing her drug test (it was her 4th offense). She's probably going to jail. It makes me sick knowing that everyone around me that I love and care about is destined to end up like this. I hate it.My dad, my sister, and my uncle are not the only drug abusers in this family, however. The huge plethora of addicts includes all my aunts & uncles, all of my grandparents (except for one), my sister, my cousins, my step-relatives, my mother.... Well, pretty much everyone. And now, on top of the rest of them, the one person that I cared about the most. The one person that I honest to God loved with all my heart is losing himself to drugs. It's my best friend. Every single day he's messed up on something and it absolutely breaks my heart. He is such a talented and intelligent person, but he is throwing it all away. This hurts worse than seeing anyone else fall into drugs, because this is my best friend. The one person I thought I could depend on. The one person I could trust to not hurt me or themselves like that.Recently, and by recently I mean exactly 3 months ago, he started using heroin. I had already begun to notice his mood swings and the drastic change in his personality. Then he told me he'd been using that stuff. I was crushed. Absolutely heartbroken. He had always been really into drugs, but I never knew it was this serious. Some of you would say that it isn't a big deal and that I should lighten up and just let people be, but you people haven't seen everyone that you have ever loved in your entire life lose the battle. I am not anti drugs. I am anti drug abuse. If people want to get high every now and then, I am totally cool with that. I'm not even saying that I never use drugs myself. It's just a shame when people let drugs take over their life. If you have the ability to use drugs responsibly and still keep a good head on your shoulders, then by all means, get high, but, unfortunately, I don't think most people have that ability. I'll admit, I think some drugs, like LSD, can be good for you, but that most people do not have the control to stop at just that. Yesterday my best friend stopped by to pick up some money because he was in 'debt'. I gave him the money then asked if I could trust him not to spend it on something he shouldn't and he said yes. His lips were moving. 7/28/01This report was started at T+50 minutesFirst tried to make tea about 3 weeks ago. I replaced two tea bags with a total 10 grams of powdered poppy pods. Boiled for like 10-15 minutes pushing the bags around and such. Split the tea two ways. Me and my friend drank it and didn't feel much more than high from the herb consumed. Thought i might have felt it but only slightly.Tonight i decided to make it more like how i had read. One person boiled 1 cup water in microwave, then dumped in 3 grams powdered poppy pods.let steep for 15 minutes, strained, and drank. He said it felt like a little more than a percocet. That sounded promising. I remember reading a while ago a lot of reports saying putting lemon juice in the water would extract everything out better.I decided, based on previouse experience with hydrocodone and a few other opiates, that i would require a little extra. I decided to triple the dose of the one i had read. T-30min - boiled 1 + 1/2 cups water with ~1tbs lemon juice on stoveT-20min - dumped in 9-10grams powdered poppy pods and turned off stove let steep for about 15 minutesT-5min  - strained with basic fine plastic mesh strainer, left some sediment, it went into solution if the glass was swirled, it was a yellow tan brown color, smelled bitterT+0min  - drank vile yellow brown liquid, tasted bitter and slightly sour from the lemon, just enough nasty taste to be hard to swallow, chased it with apple juice and a peanut butter kudos bar, worked wellT+10min - stomach seams ok, smoked kind stomach medicine just in caseT+20min - took about a 25 minute shower, felt great, high, not sure if anything elseT+50min - started writing this report, everytime i look at my hand there apears to be a bar of light over my fingers, strange, goes away within a fraction of a second, guess that was good budT+1h- feel good, kinda heavy, read about a feeling in back of neck, sorta feel that, though not sure if it is just me thinking about it, I keep mispelling stuffT+1:15  - strong pain in lower stomach, tolerable, not like a vomiting feeling wich is good, still feel high maybe heavy too, pinch myself and feel little painT+1:35  - feel altered, it feels like it is fading then it comes back, it is an odd feeling, somewhat annoying almostT+1:40  - open up a bud light long neck (born june 1, 2001), hopefully this will increase effects, though i read one report it made them through up within 5 minutes, we'll soon see, tastes alrightT+2h    - beer done, no extra nausea, except maybe from the nasty beer/poppy burpsT+2:30  - feel strange slightly off, kinda just a mild alcohol buzz, feels like the herb has worn off start ingesting beer number 2, bud light can (born same day!)T+3:00  - beer 2 done, no real rise in effect, decide to ingest 225mg tramadol, has a nice general sedative feel to it after a couple hours, couldn't hurtT+3:20  - smoke kind herb, started beer 3, feel high, not sure if i can even still feel the poppy tea no nausea for a while now, only one short bout of nausea at all T+3:45  - beer 3 done, feel alright, probably go to sleep here in a bitT+4:10  - tiredT+4:30  - think I might try to sleepT+5h- instead of sleep decide to roll a cigarete, half kind half shwagT+5:10  - noticing some itching lately within the last hour or soT+6h- smoked some kind herb, don't think i can feel anything from anything other than the herb. But I just pinched myself and I am very numb to pain Panyin and I had a cocktail or two one evening. Feeling good, we decided to dip into the ketamine stash. At that time in our lives, we were roommates in a large and beautiful house, living in a socially backward town. Ketamine was a lovely respite, a sort of entheophile's candy. We had had some emotional breakthroughs through sharing our ketamine reveries. I felt acute pain each time I tried K IM (one time I flinched so hard the syringe went flying across the coffee table, much to my embarrassment), so I always insufflated. Panyin would either do it IM or join me in the sniffing. We would lounge on opposite sides of the ample couch in the living room, listening nearly each time to Karma (Delirium) and spacing on the cushiness of our k-nest. I was prissy about the bitter-tasting drips, so I would suck on cherry cough lozenges or Altoids to cut the taste. This evening, I picked cherry lozenges.The alcohol had, unfortunately and understandably, clouded our judgment. Ketamine was not quite the thing to be doing. We sniffed a bit of powder (about 50 mg of K each) and lay back in our respective corners of the couch. After about 10 minutes, I got very woozy and felt especially nauseated. (I usually didn't feel nausea from K except upon coming down, when I would often get ambulatory, usually to change the musical selection). I now did a mortifying thing, I retched, right onto the mostly-white rug, and slid off the couch, with my face in my own cherry-colored vomit. My hair was wet from it, but the cold floor felt good against my face, and the wetness was even a bit nice. I was so high from the questionable combination of ketamine on top of a bigger-than-I-had-thought alcohol buzz, that I felt firmly pinned to the floor and was not too conscious of what was happening. Something in the recesses of my mind told me this was an especially obnoxious position to be in. But I kept vomiting in little dribbles, with spit hanging out the side of my mouth, unable to lift my head. It even felt good to let go so much, but the good feeling was underscored by barely-there horror. Meanwhile, Panyin emerged from her reverie with alarm and concern for my predicament. Even in her debilitated state, she rallied up her limbs and helped me up off the floor, maneuvering me through the living room furniture, into my bathroom, onto the floor of the largish shower. There she rinsed me off. I continued to feel pinned to the floor, only now it was *wetter* as well as cold. I was completely helpless, and felt a pang of love for my equally-intoxicated friend who was taking care of me as I lay in such a vulnerable and embarrassing position. The whole episode was like sleepwalking and telepathy at the same time -- our instincts kicked in from under the weight of the ketamine, as we coordinated enough to get our shit together. Panyin continued to clean up the mess, after putting me to bed. The next morning, we revisited the adventure over a cup of coffee. I asked Panyin to swear not to tell anyone. We marveled how -- faced with a small crisis -- she was able to suppress the effects of the ketamine and come to my rescue. We laughed at the scenario. How gauche, doing drugs and squirming in a pool of one's own vomit! It was exactly like the bad antidrug propaganda we liked to make fun of. This was a psychedelic faux pas, one of those things I will not do again: top off an alcohol buzz with ketamine. Thank goodness I had the presence of mind to make this mistake in the privacy of my own home.Another evening later in that 'season of K on the couch', I in turn performed the 'suppressing the effects of ketamine' feat. Again Panyin and I were on the couch, accompanied by our friend Adonis. It was Adonis' first time trying K. We had just sniffed (about 35-40 mg, which was enough to send us), and lay back to enjoy our reveries, when the doorbell rang. The doorbell never rang at our remote home, but unfortunately it was fairly easy for a visitor on the front stoop to observe people were inside. The doorbell set off one of my conditioned responses, and I leapt off the couch, to the incredulity of Panyin and Adonis. I proceeded to escort the visitor into the kitchen, write down his phone number, talk plaisanteries for a moment (all the while feeling cross-eyed with the surging effects of the ketamine), and walk him back out. Then I collapsed onto the couch and resumed my trip. We don't think he noticed. Note to self: Remember to not answer the door in such situations.  I'm the type of person who prefers drugs (pot, PCP, LSD, MDMA...) to alcohol. But one night (out of boredom and lack of weed) , a few friends and acquaintances and myself decided to drink (again). But this time we got a lot more than just beer. We each (out of the 10 or us) had about 3-4 40's each and a bottle or two of rum and Vodka. We first started off sitting at a friend’s house drinking the vodka and rum. Then we sat around thinking we weren't drunk enough. We then went for the 40's. This was a bad idea from the start.We were 1/2 way done when we realized that we were drunk. We were falling over everything and could not get up. The girls were ditsy and the guys were horney (not a great combo). We started running in circles, which made it worse. We left and ran up to complete strangers and saluted Adolf Hitler (not the best thing to do I know).Afterwards, girls were making out with anyone in the group who had anything left to drink. They were basically selling themselves out for a 'better' intoxication. They were degrading themselves and realized that in the end.A little later, all the guys were trying to get the girls to sleep with them. No one wanted to though. But being intoxicated, many of them just passed out and were taken advantage of. That was the saddest day I've experienced so far. It's hard to see some of your friends corrupted and others being defiled. I regret it very much. If this story actually does get on the site and someone reads it, I hope they gain something from it. You should be VERY cautious when you drink (and if you do for that matter). It was a terrible experience which shattered friendships, ruined lives, and overall changed everyone for good. The only thing I hope is that it doesn't happen to anyone else out there. Be careful and be safe. Peace. Finding the ether reports on Erowid a bit disappointing, I wanted to share a bit of my own experience.  My employment gives me access to unlimited amounts of reagent grade diethyl ether.  It is powerful stuff!  Taking (inhaling) it at baseline is the most fun.  One first feels a powerful head rush, yet this is only the beginning of the magic.  I guess the best way to describe it is that you see ghosts.  I remember one night sitting on my couch and seeing a couple walk out of my kitchen, go into my bedroom, and start making out.  Another time I was in my lab and saw a face appear on the side of a five gallon bucket- he burped at me- lol!  I've done ether a few times after drinking . . . bad idea.  I passed out for good.  Another aspect of ether is that it truly is addictive.  So, what's this dawg's bottom opinion on ether . . .?  I think it is an amazing time if done cautiously and when sober.  But as always be careful. My girlfriend and I had some time off, and we decided to trip for three days.  We licked blotter, and began hitting the bong with good Mexican hash right away, and drinking burgundy wine.  About 2 1/2 hours or so into the acid high, we each swallowed a small bottle (an ounce) of liquid kava kava, and then took two green Ecstasy tablets (about 160 mg we think).  Through out the day, we continued to smoke hash on and off, and we each drank 1/2 liters of wine or so.We did this for three days straight.  We started at about noon.  For all three days...we had pretty intense sex on and off -- esp. when the rolling began.  This was the best drug experience we had.  I am 190lbs and 6'0', and my girlfriend is 5'4' and about 105lbs.On the last day, I had dropped another dose of acid at 6:00 PM and two more x pills.  My girlfriend took another half hit of acid at 6:00 PM and two more x pills.  We shared another bottle of liquid kava kava on the last night at about 7:00 PM.We noticed no room spinning -- or any of the negative features of alcohol.  We both felt very warm, tingling and numb.  I felt extremely numb in my lips.  We both felt very light-headed, and 'detached.'  The feelings were very powerful, relaxing and peaceful.We felt the rolling about a 1/2 hour after we took the x.  It had to be about 4 times as strong...but we did not notice any negative heart racing...  We are not sure why.There were no real visual hallucinations other than everything feeling 'fuzzy' and we felt a kind of mystical one-ness.  We arranged to be alone in a very peaceful setting -- with relaxing music throughout the day.  We slept a very strong 7-9 hours each day...and on the final day -- we both had intense dreams.It seems that the hash and kava kava might have reduced the jitters that we normally feel after rolling.  The next day there was little 'hangover' but we both felt a little 'numb,' and agreed that this experience was also very positive, but that it would be hard to do any kind of serious work, as we just wanted to sit back and relax.  I think any kind of concentration would have been difficult.During the experiences, we ate light...fruit, salads, breads...but never really had an empty stomach -- and ate three meals each day.This morning -- on the fourth day -- we were fine.  Feeling extremely relaxed, lazy, and slightly numb.We think kava kava alone -- or in combination with hash -- took the edge off any hangover.The sex was incredible.  It effected my girlfriend greatly -- it had a profound dsinhibiting effect --- to the point where she now claims she claims to want to have the type of sex she was once afraid to try -- anal and light bondage -- which we got into the last few days.  This activity was new for me.  It is hard to describe, but it seems to 'change' your personality a little, and make you more receptive.We both want to mix these drugs again --- the experience was so wonderful.  Usually, we roll about once a month, and normally are very light social drinkers.I am almost afraid to write these words...cause I feel if anyone tries doing what we did --- they would be hooked --- it felt so so good.One more thing --- it seemed like we needed to drink a lot of water...and had felt a bit dehydrated. I had a rough bout with E from October of 2000 to January 2001.  I was 20.  Before that, I hadn't really been a big abuser of drugs.  I basically was your run-of-the-mill Catholic school girl gone wrong, having started to smoke a lot of pot and drink heavily in my senior year of high school all of the sudden.  Like breaking out of a shell.At first, the pot used to make me really nervous and I would freak out and get paranoid, but I learned to love it.  I was a complete pothead by the time I was a freshman at college.  And of course, I got absorbed into pot culture...  it's captivating in a way... just the whole atmosphere behind it all...Anyway, fast-forward to last fall, which was supposed to be my junior year of college.  That summer, I was smoking really good KB about 4 or 5 times a day and drinking a six-pack of decent beer on my porch every night.  I used to wake up at 2pm the next day with a half a beer on my window sill and drink that for breakfast.  I was pretty numb to my anxieties at this point and suffering from a lot of depression, though I would never admit it and was probably unaware of it anyway because I was high all the time.  I had been putting off some casual therapy for years.  There was nothing wrong with me enough to require drugs or a psychiatrist or anything... I just really needed someone to talk to... but I was smoking all the time and I thought it was helping so I just put it off...So I had really wanted to try E.  In October, this shady kid I'd been sleeping with over the summer called me at 4am to ask me if I knew anyone who wanted some pills.  So I said, yeah - me.  They were big, blue statues of liberty pills.  Not double stacked or anything, but big.  I was half scared and half excited.My boyfriend and I decided to take the pills at our off-campus house on a Thursday night.  We lived in a three floor house with 16 other people so we figured there'd be enough going on there to keep us busy.  We didn't really make any plans to go out because I freak easily and we wanted to make sure I stayed calm.  The setting was calm - people smoking bowls in the common room, studying, making dinner... lots of light and low music.  We'd bought two gallons of water to drink cuz we were scared shitless about the dehydration stories.  We didn't smoke or anything beforehand cuz we just wanted to experience a pure MDMA high.So we popped them at about 7 and at first, nothing seemed to be happening.  The scared part of me seemed relieved in a way... but then I started to feel tiny pinpricks of nervousness eat away at me.  It was strange... like my body knew it was waiting for something.  We complained that they were duds and climbed up to my loft to hang out... at about 8, I started to feel slightly like my body was physically expanding to encompass the area of the room... like it was spreading out in little particles all over... but I didn't feel high and I could think very clearly, so I was confused.  All of the sudden, I looked at this crack in the wall of my loft and I let it out: 'That is the most beautiful thing I have ever seen,' I said.  BOOM.  Instantaneously I was rolling, and so was my boyfriend, who was looking out the window at all the people walking by and talking to them.  It was overwhelming.  At first I thought I wouldnt' be able to handle it.  My heart began racing faster than I'd thought it would and I started to sweat and shake... my boyfriend had me lie down, at which point I started babbling about how wonderful it all was and how I wanted to be at peace with it all... but I didn't know if I was ok... it passed.  The rest of the night was one of the best experiences I've ever had.  We listened to music, came clean with people in the house over stupid issues... talked their heads off... got it all on video... had sex... but we didn't even want to... we were too busy holding each other and telling each other how much we loved each other...  It was like the connecting mentally was more important than the actual sex.  I felt like I was walking on air too and fast.  Very speedy.  I was hooked then and there.The next day I had diarrhea before my 8am class for three hours... vomited once or twice... thought I was absolutely going to die... but I was so goddam happy even still... I didn't care.  I was still clenching my jaw that day, lying in bed sick... smiling my ass off and making phone calls for more E.Over the next three and a half months, I did E at least once a weekend and usually more in pretty much the same exact setting and always with just my boyfriend.  We never went out.  We liked the house.  We never took more than one pill at a time or more than one pill per experience.  No time was EVER as good as the first.  The first three or four times were fantastic.  The rest of them we usually spent getting high (smoking gravity bong hits, which I had started doing at a rate of three or so per day with good KB) and complaining that the E was weak.We started arguing a lot.  A lot.  I started crying a lot more.  I had barely noticed, but my friends had all stopped talking to me.  I had secluded myself with my boyfriend in my room most of the time and had started to hate everyone in the house.  On Christmas Eve, my very calm and peaceful boyfriend threw me into a closet, stuck his fingers down my throat, ripped a sweater I was wearing into shreads and left me in the bathroom while I held a razor to my wrist.  The whole time, I couldnt' figure out what had gone wrong.  We had done E the night before and we were so addicted we just kept trying to get more anytime anything like this would happen, but it had gotten to the point where we weren't even getting high anymore.  We were pissed off and frustrated and blaming it on the dealers, saying the E was weak, tampered, fake.On January 1, 2001, I took my last hit of E.  The night before I had taken a huge rip off the gravity bong and had forgotten my name... I had been in the kitchen telling my boyfriend that the voice in my head told me to guard my neck...  riiiiiight... this sort of thing pretty much did not happen to me from smoking pot, so I was a little freaked out about taking E the next day, but I did anyway...  It was snowing outside and for once, we decided to go out.  We thought it would kick in while we were playing in it.  About six blocks from the house, I suddenly looked around and everything was weird.  I wasn't hallucinating or seeing things or anything like that... I can't really explain it... just, the world was NOT as it shoudl have been.  Houses and buildings looked scary and I was afraid.  I thought my boyfriend was trying to kill me... we started walking back and I nearly collapsed from the cold weather.  I couldn't talk... my speach was slurred...  My mind was racing with weird thoughts... specifically that the world wasn't really there... that I had been imagining it my whole life.  I got into the shower and then passed out.  It was absolutely horrible.  The big surprise came the next day when I STILL FELT THIS WAY.  I literally woke up in the middle of a panic attack.  Screaming, crying and shaking.  I couldn't tell who was real and where I was.  I felt as though my mind had retreated back into my head... far away behind a glass wall and that I was just watching everyone around me but not really participating.  I had no appetite.  I felt sick.  Things were coming out of my mouth and they were making sense, but I had no idea how it was happening.  I was scared shitless.For the next two full months, I constantly endured this horrifying state of mind until it finally started to get better.  Strange, scary things happened to me.  I was in the car as a passenger when I told my boyfriend that he was just a figment of my imagination and that I knew I was really driving.  He freaked.  I would go up to my housemates and touch them to see if they were really there, which freaked them out.  It was horrible.  I thought I was mental for life.  I couldn't get out from that glass wall and I read about dissociative disorder and started thinking it was me...I was physically sick too.  I went from 125 lbs. to 100 lbs. in three weeks, which, believe me, is painful.  My skin turned yellowish.  My eyes sunk in.  I WOULD NOT eat.  Not because I didn't want to, but well, because I had no appetite at all and becase food looked so scary.  Everything was so scary.  I developed night sweats so bad that I had to change my T shirt four times a each night... we were in the back room with the windows open in the middle of January.  I was so dehydrated that if and when I peed, it was this sick, orangy color.  I had to wait for my boyfriend to get home to help me shower because I could not stand up alone.  I had lost too much weight and felt dizzy enough to pass out.  Finally, I developed a 102 degree fever which remained constant for TWO WEEKS.  This is when I decided to go to the doctor - at the beginnning of February since all of these symptoms had continued for over a month now.  Keep in mind I had stopped ALL drug usage on the 1st of January.  ALL of it.  So I'd been sober and crazy and sick.I was honest with the doc (guys - you can do this - they have a legal obligation not to tell anyone) and she said, well, you're going through intense physical methamphetamine withdrawal.  She asked me if I'd had the pills tested cuz it sounded like I'd done a lot of meth and/or amphetamines to her... she even kept asking me if I'd done coke which I'd never touched, but hardly believed me.  She said my symptoms were severe.  I'd also started to suffer from a lung infection from smoking so goddam much.  She didn't put me on any medication and said to wait it out.  I was scared.  She said my mental health would get better... that I was going through 'methamphetamine psychosis'... something lots of users develop in withdrawal that is temporary but makes them schiz out a lot for months afterward.Finally at the end of March, I felt good enough to come home and start working.  It took a while to get used to and I was still having sporadic panic attacks, but I did it.  I told my parents everything... kept going to therapy... saved money and took some summer classes and now here I am, I've been sober almost 8 months, from everything, I have a good relationship with my parents, I've resolved my depression and my mental health is stable.  I gained back all the weight and am healthier than I've ever been.  I am so lucky that things turned out all right.Through therapy I discovered zen meditation and philosophical means of working through my cravings (which I still have SEVERAL of) and my anxieties.  My relatives have noticed a huge change in me and say I'm a much happier, relaxed person.  Through meditation, you can achieve the same high you get on E, but you can control it.  The basic ritual of counting your breaths as you meditate helps this, placing you in a euphoric, yet contolled state of peace and calmness.  I would recommend this to anyone interested in the topic.This whole thing has changed my life.  All my beliefs, my plans for life, my friends (who, after much effort on my part, came back to me), my family... ALL CHANGED...  I will never, ever be the same.  I still have mini flashbacks and sometimes horrible panic attacks... but as time goes by, I learn to deal with them and to calm myself down.  This has just been one hell of an experience that I still find hard to belive I went through... and sharing it not only is a theraputic release, but also lets me know I may be helping other people... research your drugs before you experiment, and don't do as much as frequently as i did... that was my biggest mistake... all in moderation...  Hope this enlightened some curious folks out there... I was just starting a three-day weekend, and my Foxy had arrived that morning... I was waffling between AMT,  2C-T-7 and Foxy, when I remembered that I take Paxil, so the MAOI effects of AMT could lead to some serious medical complications... With this in mind I opted for the Foxy. I didn't have access to an analytical scale anymore, I guess organic chem. lab was of some use after all; so I eyeballed what I guessed to be an even 10 mg and stuffed two capsules each with 10 mg, Big Mistake...  My friend came over at around 9 and we took the gelatin capsules... I swallowed mine, and he poured his out on his tongue since he cant swallow pills for some reason... (T +5min.) My friend tells me that he's starting to feel weird, I consider this odd but don't really give much thought to it...(T +20min.) My friend now tells me that he's fucked up, but that he doesn't know what he's supposed to be feeling. I tell him to just lay back and let it happen...(T +30min.) I finally start to feel it and get the usual speedy twinges in my in my legs and arms... I become kinda restless and find that these tingly sensations make it hard to sit still... I can't say I like this sensation, but I remember it from previous experiences and remember that it always goes away after an hour or so.... My friend on the other hand, he is really really fucked up and tripping balls ... He is restless just like me and from what sentences I can get him to make I think he's having the same odd sensations... He keeps on telling me that he is very retarded....(T +45min.) I am starting to really come up at this point, but remember the Foxy peak as only being like an hour, and tell this to my friend who is tripping very hard at this point...  He tells me that he is too fucked up and doesn't know what's going on... I tell him to relax and that it will smooth out after a while...(T +1-3hr.)  I am starting to get these really intense tingling twitchy sensations all over my body, it makes getting comfortable impossible so I find myself wiggling around trying to get comfortable... The same exact thing is happening to my friend, and he is even worse in this respect than I am... My vision starts shifting and I am getting that definite tryptamine feel to things... My friend is starting to bug out and is now on the floor moving all over the place, stopping sometimes to go into some sort of trance.... He doesn't appear to be having a good time so I spend the next half hour reassuring him that everything will be alright and that it is just a powder he took and that he will be fine in a little bit... I try to get him to talk as much as possible so that he doesn't drift off and make this experience any worse... This seems to really help him, but the body load is really almost unbearable and seems even worse for my friend... I don't want him going berserk so I sit there talking to him for the next hour, which is a real drag on my trip and really prevents me from going anywhere...   The psychedelic component of this substance at these doses is VERY strong; I am getting very vivid visuals and could feel a marked amount of dissociation if it wasn't for me having to keep my friend grounded... The body load however was very very uncomfortable, and unacceptable for further research at whatever level this was... I manage to keep my friend afloat, but unfortunately am doing the same for myself in the process...  My friend seems to be settling down a little as am I, but he still seems to go deep into wherever he was every couple of minutes... This is really sucking for me so I decide to swill down some beers in hopes of numbing out these odd body sensations that keep the both of us from sitting still... I crack my beer open and take a few sips, within 5-10 minutes I really start to settle down and it seems to smooth out the body load... I neglected to mention this up to this point, but my friend had already had 3 or 4 rather severe vomiting sessions, to the point where he was just dry heaving....  He has one more and it seems to be the last of it so I give him a beer to settle him down... Fortunately it does and after a few minutes he really settles down... Visuals are still getting stronger which I find shocking(T +4hrs-10hrs)  Man, this stuff lasts much longer than I remember...  We finally get some peace and we both just relax for a few minutes... I notice how weird my friend is looking so I start laughing at him... He looks at me and starts ripping into me about how strange I look... We go back and forth ripping on each other with the laughter growing to a hysterical level... We start going insane with laughter and are both having a great time... this is how it should have been from the beginning, but my friend had to go and become a pussy and freak out or was it that I had to eyeball this stuff and overdose my friend, we each had a different opinion about whose fault it was... We start drinking heavily and after a while he asks me to sprinkle some more of the stuff on his tongue, I tell him NO emphatically and he keeps trying to get me to give him more... I don't relent, but we do continue drinking and drinking and when the beer ran out we started doing some whippets, once those run out I cook up some pasta shit and we eat and sleep...(Next Day) I wake up the next day feeling slightly tired but surprisingly all right for all that drinking... I am still off baseline and continue getting some visuals for the next 12 hours, after another day of heavy drinking I manage to sleep early...WOW, this stuff sure has the potential to be an ass-kicking psychedelic... I have taken it before, but this new batch has a brilliant white/clear crystalline glassy look to it and looks like it is of much higher quality/potency than the last batch I obtained... don't know if this had much to do with it but I do know that eyeballing it was a big mistake, in retrospect it could have been 20 mg or even more, who knows!! The body load however was unbearable and you won't catch me trying this stuff at such high doses ever again... All in all a lesson in not being cheap and going out and purchasing a scale, this material was relatively forgiving for such an overdose, but you won't catch me doing that again for a while... I am not a big fan of drugs. Am I curious? Of course. Would I try them? No. I have smoked pot. It's about everything I thought it would be. Nothing more, nothing less. And I'm done. I don't like drugs, but alcohol is a different story. I am not going to write about my first time getting drunk. Rather, I am writing about the worst alcoholic overdose a 2 1/2 year (recovered) alcoholic could be involved in without medical assistance or death.It was a very boring day, very depressing, and I myself was very depressed. I was contemplating suicide, when a friend of mine asked if I wanted to get drunk at a party a friend of hers was having. I have heard about deaths related to alcoholic overdoses, and thought I might be able to pull it off. So I accepted the invitation.  I figured as long as there was enough hard liquor, I could waste my little body away without even realizing it. So my spirits rose.When we arrived at the party, it was rather a little 'let's get drunk' get-together. After scanning the resources, there was almost all the hardest liquor a couple weeks' paychecks could buy. I went up to the counter and just began taking shot after shot of the hardest selected alcoholic beverages. I figured I'd get it done in the beginning so I wouldn't be 'aware' when I was dying.  I loaded myself with about 18-20 shots before someone told me to slow down. This was one of the last moments I remember. I told them I was fine, I can handle my alcohol well...I was fine. I went to pour a shot and I just spilled the alcohol all over the floor. They made me sit down. I sat down on the couch and we were all watching porn. I thought it was boring, and the very last thing I remember is getting up and crashing down on the carpet. The rest of the night I was out cold. And the night was long, and my unconsciousness was even longer.The rest of these events have been vividly described and detailed by my very close friends who were there with me. I cannot recall endless hours of the night, I do not remember or recall any of the following, but out of the trust I share with my friends, these events seem plausible.After I crashed to the floor, everyone freaked out. Nobody had drunk as much as I had. I got back up and decided to have more alcohol -- to them I had regained mental ability to make choices. They 'fed' me more shots (an estimated 10 more) one after the other until collapsing several times, they quit. I began crawling on the floor begging for more, and I was told that the shots there after were a mixture of soda pop and water, and I believed it. After this, and after they cut off all real and 'fake' alcohol, I completely lost it. I walked around for a little bit, until even that was a task I could not complete. I busted the kitchen table and dining room coffee table from passing out on them. I passed out several times into walls and woke up with very large 'bumps' on my head and bruises scattered over my body. I fell face first into a wall twice and broke up my lip real bad and busted my nose open (I'm thankful I didn't break it), and ended up with blood all over my clothing. During these events I was ranting and raving with very slurred speech that I wanted sex (which I would not say in a sober mindset), and began to talk like a person that was not me. I was told shortly after I started blurting out these things, a guy tried to convince another guy there to rape me, but with 2 of my friends threatening the hell out of him, he backed down. That alone is scary. Soon after I lost speech, and the physical ability to move my own body. I would 'pass out' and throw up on myself, choking and suffocating on my own vomit. Nobody would help but my 2 closest friends there, and I am thankful that they were even there. I otherwise would have died. After I threw up several times everywhere I began convulsing. Everyone there was scared shitless and I even scared one guy into not drinking anymore, and one girl just sat and cried. My best friend thought I was going to die. Most everyone agreed to call the paramedics, but the guy renting that particular apartment wouldn't allow it because he was providing alcohol for several minors, including me.  I began to convulse uncontrollably. I also began foaming at the mouth I was so dehydrated. My lips were totally bitten up, along with my tongue because of the jaw-lock I experienced during the convulsions. I would not drink water; I would just spit it out. At this point I learned some of the people there didn't think I'd wake up in the morning. Finally I was put in a room monitored by my best friend's boyfriend. I was stripped of all my vomit-covered clothing and continued to dry heave for an hour before I completely lost all mental AND physical abilities and blacked out. I know alcohol is a depressant, and it very well makes you tired in the end, but I wonder where the line was crossed and I was actually 'sleeping'. I woke up very early morning the next day. I woke up in a room I had never been in before. I grabbed the sheet and realized I was dressed in only a bra and underwear and I started crying. I did not know how I got there or why I woke up in that room. When I woke up, at first I did not have any usual groggy side effects. My throat was very sore, and I threw up bile twice that morning, and it felt like I completely burned my throat away, only this time making it to the toilet. I was ordered to take a shower, and so I did, almost passing out in the shower, but I was able to control it. I got out of the shower and lay on the couch while my bloodstained, vomit-covered clothes were being washed. At this point the side effects set in. Even the day after is still a blur to me... I remember lying on the couch and it felt like something was trying to rip my stomach and intestines out. Like somebody was taking a food beater and just beating the hell out of my insides. I remember hot flashes of pain pulsing through my body, my head was roaring, I felt like I could hear and feel my heart beat throughout my body, and at that point I begged for somebody to kill me. The effects last for days, with every day some awful random side effect that would take over my body...headaches, hot/cold flashes, or vomiting, etc. The most reasonable assumption was I had given myself alcohol poisoning, and escaped death by a hair. This has taught me a lot.  I still drink, and no, I am not unintelligent for making that decision. I know my limit. I know how much I can drink before feeling any side effects. I no longer drink alone (a big bad habit of mine in the beginning) and I don't usually drink at social events with my peers when there is alcohol present. In fact, I rarely ever drink.  But the urge is always there. The urge is here now. It took a lot to stop drinking as much as I did. And now I can drink and still be 'sober' enough to always aware of my physical abilities and actions. This incident happened a year ago, and since then I have never lost the ability to use clear judgement from alcohol consumption.Drinking can be fun at times, but drinking can turn deadly. I have witnessed this first hand. The safest way to drink is drink non-alcoholic beverages, but if you so choose to drink, know the consequences, and know you are not always in control of your actions. I used to be known as the drunk at parties. It lowers your self-esteem because people only see you for what you are when you are drunk. And you don't need a drink to 'be yourself' because having a drink only alters you. I cannot stop the world from engaging in harmful drinking...the only thing I can do is share my story, and hope that at least one person reads this and gains something out of it. (I'm writing this report in part as a response to JJ because I beleive there are some similarities between my experience and his so I hope it will help in some way for him to recover.)I started having problems during Febuary 2000. I had two jobs, one full time during the week and one part time on occasional weekends and evenings. I spent all the money I was earning socially - I used to go out drinking 5-6 times a week and in order to stay awake, make it into work and enjoy myself when out, I was taking half pills whenever I went to the pub, as well as going out clubbing twice a weekend, when I would take a fair amount of E aswell as drinking alcohol. I was smoking alot of weed too.This kind of abuse had already started to take its toll - I had my first paranoia attack one weekend in Febuary, when I had somehow ended up on my own after clubbing (I had a fairly wide circle of friends and as I'm normally ok and with people they had all assumed I was with someone else). I am not going to describe that experience here, but after that I took great care not to be on my own when getting wrecked, and then carried on as normal.A couple of months after that I went out drinking with my best mate P on a Friday night the weekend after a particularly heavy session. We went on a mad one round town, and we somehow ended up losing each other. After trying to find him, I eventually gave up and went to another mates' flat.Once at the flat there were alot of our mates round, so I dropped a pill, carried on drinking and started smoking weed. After about an hour and a half everyone had gone and there was just me and two of my best mates, who actually owned the flat, left. At that point P phoned to say that he was ok, he had just been kicked out of a club and he was coming round.As soon as he went off the phone the whole world seemed to change in front of my eyes. I suddenly thought that these people hated my guts, and had trapped me in there flat. P was going to come round and tear my head off. I started to leave, but my friends tried to stop me, telling me P wouldn't do anything (he was me best mate after all). But I just thought that they wanted me to stay so that they could all torture me and kill me once P had got there. My friends have said afterwards that they had thought there might something wrong, but I kept saying I'll be alright and gave a load of other excuses to leave, and eventually they let me go because in the end I seemed ok.Once outside I realised I had left something in the flat, but I felt I couldn't go back. I was terrified to walk round outside incase I met P. There is a taxi rank next to my friends flat, but I took a huge detour all round town to avoid anywhere he might be, absolutely terrified of meeting him or any of my other friends. Eventually I got to the taxi rank, but I was terrified about going in it or near it in case P saw me. After hiding in the shadows for a bit and watching to make sure he was nowhere to be seen, I got myself a taxi and it wasn't until I got myself home and locked myself in my room that I snapped out of the trance and realised something had gone seriously wrong. The whole experience lasted about an hour and a half.The thing that scared me most about this experience is how long it took me to recover. For the few months I was at home after that, I still thought that my mates hated being with me - if it wasn't for my girlfriend inviting me out all the time I might have just locked myself away or something. I was constantly living in a world of paranoia, I thought I was boring and couldn't make friends with people. On the outside I seemed reasonably normal, although quieter than I used to be, but in my head I was being constantly haunted. I felt as if I couldn't talk to anyone about it either. It is worth noting that these really are good friends of mine - I have known them for years and grown up with them.It wasn't just my friends I thought evil of either - I started to blame my parents for every little bad thing that ever happened to me while I was growing up, but now when I look at it none of it was really their fault at all, but this seriously affected my relationship with my parents for some time.Now over a year later I feel as if I have recovered. Just after this happened I had started to realise that when I was on MDMA, the world seemed how it should be, and I could start to answer some of the problems and questions in my head. Therefore to sort my head out, when I went away to university at September last year, I took the opportunity to take pills nearly every day again (but without drinking or smoking) and gradually rid myself of the paranioa by not facing a comedown, so I suppose I became psychologically dependant on MDMA. I lost my phone and all my numbers, so therefore lost contact with everyone at home. While at university I started to form a new set of friends, and it wasn't until I started to notice similarites between them and my friends at home that I realised that thats what those people at home were, my friends. When I go back home now, it is as if I never left (none of my mates went to university so when I go home I am the only one returning), so I settle back in straight away. To them nothing seems different, but to me everything seems clearer. I feel like I'm with friends, rather than friends who hate me. Of course this was affecting every aspect of my life, because I thought if my friends can't like me, no one can, so I felt as if I couldn't trust anyone.The process of clearing my head for me worked in two stages - first I had to convince myself that they were paranioa attacks, and that they did actually happen (rather than what I saw being true!), and secondly I had to try and work out why they happened. I am still finding some of the reasons why, I think that they include the fact that I was bullied in school when younger (everyone hated me then so why shouldn't they hate me now?), because it was a bad trip and it brought out hidden demons from the past, and the fact that I was on drugs all the time so I never got to speak to my mates when straight.Each time I give an account of this everything seems a little clearer, the more people I speak to about it, the more people I learn to trust again. I now feel happier than I ever have been, and have alot more repect for drugs and how they can alter your awareness and outlook on life. I still take alot of E, and I have recently started drinking and smoking again, but now I make sure I give myself regular breaks and talk to people as much as possible about any problems I might have.Bad trips such as these are serious - they can take a lot of time to recover from and people who have them need the support of others. I would like to urge everyone with similar experiences to post them to Erowid, because even writing this account now has helped my mind break free just a little more. This is not a single trip report, but rather an analysis of several experiences with salvia, nitrous, MJ and alcohol taken in combination.  It is particularly interesting because I find none of these substances to be all that special by themselves, at least compared with 'harder' substances such as LSD and mushrooms.First, some background.  I have plenty of experience with alcohol and MJ and would call my experiences typical.  I enjoy alcohol at the 'slight buzz' stage, but strongly dislike the effects beyond this.  (I'm fond of good beer, and often wish I could drink more for the taste without getting drunk.)  My experience with nitrous is moderate -- it is a cheap thrill and nothing more.  I am still a novice with salvia.  I can obtain a calming, centered, meditative state by smoking dried leaves, but have yet to experience the mind-blowing experiences that others have reported.The first time I tried all these together was an unplanned occurance at at party of about 30-40 people were only a small number of people were doing anything other than mass consumption of alcohol.  Hardly an ideal set and setting.  I had about 4 beers (my typical evening's limit) and enough MJ for a good stone when a friend brought out his salvia pipe.  I estimate that I smoked about 100 mg. of very dry leaf over a 10 minute period.  This was enough to notice a definite change in perception, though rather difficult to describe as other than pleasant and calming.  A few minutes later, my friend brought out a nitrous cracker and a box of carts.  I did a full cart and I knew something was up right away, because for the first time I actually found the nitrous more than just a cheap thrill.  I did a total of 3-4 carts over a 15-20 minute period, going up for a higher, longer rush each time.  The last one was completely mind blowing.  I'm sure the effect lasted only a few minutes, but it felt as if it lasted for maybe 15 minutes or more.  After that I sat uable to move or speak, yet aware of my surroundings, for about 20 minutes (this time measured by the time on a VCR)  At this point I got a ride home and quickly fell fast asleep.  I woke up with no ill effects, knowing that this was something I wanted to explore more thoroughly.Several weeks later I had another chance.  Several rather experienced psychonauts gathered at 1am for a 'no substances barred' party.  I had 3-4 beers at a concert earlier in the evening (9pm-midnight) and we started the party smoking some MJ while planning our cocktails.  I decided on simply a *large* dose of P. Cubensis.  We then decided to watch _Fight Club_ on an 80 inch. projection TV.  We had all seen the movie many times, and each of us can relate to the movie in a special way.  I can't speak for the others, but my launching coincided directly with the movie.  About an hour in as the screen was dissolving, I closed my eyes and got some of the most amazing animated 3-D visuals I have ever seen in my life.  After the movie was over (about 4am) we went outside to walk in the grass, spin poi, and watch the sun come up as we came down.  I spent much time alone meditating during this time.  About 8am we were most of the way down and went back inside.  We smoked some more MJ to ease the crash, when the salvia and nitrous came out.  I smoked about 100 mg. of salvia, chased it with a whippet, and was catapulted right back to the peak of the mushroom trip for about five minutes.  This was repeated twice more with similar effects.  Shortly after the third one my girlfriend started talking about the few people killed at Burning Man.  She started to talk about this guy who took LSD and then got on a motorcycle.  This was *really* bothering me, so I asked her to stop, but she didn't.  A few moments later, I re-lived a motorcycle accident I had four months earlier in the crystal clarity that only a strong psychedelic experience can provide and wound up a sobbing mess for the next 20 minutes.  Although it was a horrifying experience, I never felt out of control, and in a very odd way it was strangely enjoyable.  I could elaborate here for hours and still not fully explain what happened.  Suffice to say it was an incredibly powerful experience.  I can't begin to imagine where I might have gone if I did this a little earlier while still heavily into the mushroom trip.My third and most recent experience happened just a few nights ago under somewhat more controlled conditions.  I was with two close friends and were were watching the movie Baraka.  I was curious to see how the A + M + S + N coctail would work at a moderate dosage.  I started with two beers and enough MJ for a good stone.  About an hour later I smoked about 250 mg. dried salvia leaf.  The effects of the salvia were definitely more noticable than previous attempts, likely because I smoked harder and faster, yet still far from what I believe is possible.  I waited about five minutes to get a feel for the salvia and did a N20 cart.  Almost immediately I went into a state or nirvana which lasted a good five minutes before tapering off.  I did 3-4 more carts of N20 over the next hour combined with about 100 mg. more salvia, achieving about the same level each time.Again, the experience was completely unlike *anything* I have ever experienced before.  The combined effect of these four substances in rather moderate dosage is completely unlike any of them, or even any subset of them, taken in much higher dosages.  (Excepting the salvia, of course, which I have not thoroughly explored by itself yet.)  I have no way to describe the feeling other than pure bliss or perhaps a nirvana state.  The interesting thing I noticed this time was that after the strong nirvana rush wore off, the next few hours were very happily tainted with it's aftereffects.The same evening I turned one of my friends onto the same combination.  His prior experiences were quite similar to mine, and although I tried to prepare him for what might come, it *still* took him completely by surprise.  This leads me to believe that this coctail may produce similar results in many who try it. I'd like to share a _very_ intense experience i had yesterday whilst experimenting (quite heavily, i might add) with DXM. Around 3 months ago, i'd pursued research into usage of DXM, especially into one state of consciousness known on the DXM faq as 'Plateau Sigma'. This seemed to be a very delusional and unpleasant state, but I was adiment that I would pursue it, just to see if I (a self named, and externally named subgenius) could control my mind, psyche and consciousness whilst in this state.Here's how I dosed (note: i didn't follow the faq):T+00h: ingested 500mg white (foul tasting) powder in vodka (1 shot)waited awhile. after around 30min i felt first effects, at which time I took a gelcap containing 350mg more dxm. i took another dose later, but i'll get to that in a minuteI sat on my sofa in my room, having the odd cigartette and playing with my guitar (btw,  this is very satisfying in conjunction with cannabis). at roughly the 3hr point, i snapped out of my guitar / cigarette trance, realising that i was struming away absolute bullcrap instead of trying to perfect 'riders on the storm'. fair enough. the world around me after this trance was so utterly alien it's really impossible to describe.Imagine this: i'm around 10 inches tall, with really long legs and the room around me is the size of what literally seems like the Sydney opera house. in front of me is a coffee table, which although was right in ront of me seemed quite far away. I had the sensation that there was now no wall or sofa behind me and that at any given moment i could fall into nothingness, so i had to constantly check. there was nothing outside this little world i was in at the moment, reality beyond the room seemed incomprehensible and all that was there was what i thought was infinity. space and time, and even life itself would disappear in a nanosecond were i to leave this room. thanatos at my door, and a black hole behind me, how comforting. then i realised that my thoughts were completely delusional, so i snapped out of it and looked around again. still the same, but this time i realised it was my room and i was safe there. ok.i'd prepared one final dose for myself on my bedside table, as another vodka shot (650mg DXM), and a paracetamol lying next to it (thoughts become more delusional as body temp rises) so down that went and i lay on my bed for a while. i sort of dozed off, & went to a world of mine which i keep in my mind for psychedelic trips. i was there, the place was vast & white, full of buildings, the floor a conveyor belt of geometric patterns and the sky a green entrance to the infinity. my quest this time was simply to explore as far as i could before awakening. i had the advantage over the world this time. my body needed no control and i had neither the inhibitions of emotion or pain.Turning the corner i encountered what i thought was the god-entity. this, i thought was the entity ruling absolutely over the different realities and as such had unquestionnable power over me, my life and everything, everywhere. darkness came and went, different realities passed - planets were brought to me and disappeared just as quickly, full of different ecosystems, different florae and faunae, culture and religion. just as i got a glimpse into a new and wonderful world, another would appear, equally as intriguing. i now had no body, no soul and no attributes to my name. i was powerless to go forward from this point and my only choice was to observe what was happening around me.My vision skipped and i was back to my bedroom. i looked at myself, then struggled to see the time on the clock. 1pm, four and a half hours since first ingestion. that meant, to my relief that I'd come back to what was my world, the world I was comfortable and familiar with. no, that was wrong. I looked out of my window. everything was different, the trees outside, the neighbourhood and people i saw were all monstrous. these realities i had seen were now combined, and no matter how i tried to bring myself back to reality, it stayed the same. oh crap. i broke down in tears, thinking the world would stay like that, and i'd be trapped with monsters, my emotions and my personality consumed by this god-entity. whereas i was a god of my own inner reality, this one was of far vaster knowlege, and in his eyes i was pathetic, so he took away what was me and replaced it with a dead, roaming soul.I went back to my bed, and just lay down, drifting in and out of consciousness, thinking ' will i drift like this forever? at least i'm peaceful this way, so i'll stay like this'.At some point i fell fully into sleep, having very weird dreams, and awoke around 12 hours later, feeling very dry, and very hungry, i just sat on my bed, lit a cigarette and thought about what happened. i felt so glad to be where i was, to be smoking this cig, to be myself once again and that my friends, family and girlfriend were all out there, not knowing this state. I'd been given a new lease of life and wasn't going to abuse it, and to this day i've felt better about the world around me, about myself, and about the people around me. i think it's about as close as i ever got to a near-death experience, and no other drug i've tried has had nearly as profound an effect on me as DXM. but there was a very good and justified reason that dr. Shulgin described this and similar drugs as 'delusional anaesthetics'. beware.peace to you all, and remember, do not visit plateau sigma. i was stupid to think i could keep myself in a place like that.  DOSE: T+ 0:00 2.0 mg oral Pharms - Alprazolam (pill / tablet) \\xa0 T+ 0:30 2.0 mg oral Pharms - Alprazolam (pill / tablet)            BODY WEIGHT:   125 lb         First off, I was did not know what I was getting when I took these pills. I didn't know how potent Xanex was or anything (i have since learned to KNOW about the drug you are about to indulge in). BUT, since I did not know that the dosage that was given to me was a lot, I didn't worry about how much alcohol i was consuming.All that I know is that I took the first Xanex pill at about 7pm, the 2nd one a half hour later and then the next thing I knew, I was waking up the next afternoon not knowing what the hell happened. I have never blacked out before so it scared me shitless. The even crazier thing is that I was at work (at a bar) when i took the pills and so I have no idea how I worked, how much I drank, how I got home, nothing. I am much more careful now, but I don't know if I'll ever take Xanex again..... Jonny and I had been experimenting with xanax as well as valium and vicodin for some time and felt pretty experienced with them. One summer night about 8pm, while we were with our mutual friend Tom, we all decided to 'take some pills to get loaded.' Having built a tolerance for valium and vicodin, I popped two 5mg valium, four 5/500 vicodin and two 7.5/750 vicodin. Jonny had 2mg of xanax, and approximately 27mg of hydrocodone, which is the intoxicating chemical in vicodin. Tom, whom Jonny and I considered a 'lightweight' took 1mg of xanax, and 20mg of hydrocodone.We sat on the swings for a while, just waiting for effects to come to us. Of course, they never come if you wait for them so we left and started walking to Tom's house, which was about a block away. Upon arrival, we sat down on his porch for a cigarette and decided we should smoke some weed while we were at it. I produced my bowl and proceded to pack it tightly. After having smoked it out, we looked at the time and it was about T+1 from or from when we took it all. Needless to say, we were all coming up pretty hard and tried to figure out what to do with ourselves. The thing about xanax is that you can't seem to tell when the affects are present. You smile and giggle a lot and are easily engaged in conversation.So we sat on the back porch and shot the shit for about another hour. Jonny had to be home at 11pm to sleep to be up for a family trip the next morning. We piled into Tom's car at about 10:15 and made the 15 minute drive to Jon's house. Jon's dad was just closing up the house when we came in. We said our hellos and Jonny's dad went to bed. We figured the best thing to do on a hot summer night was to go swimming. We swam for about half an hour and then tried off in the garage.Somebody brought up the fact that there was beer in the refridgerator right next to us. We each grabbed two and opened on up and sat with our feet in the water, sipping beer and talking. I can't recalled exactly what we were talking about but it seemed pretty interesting because soon it was 11:45 and Tom and I ran to his van and started homeward hoping to get to the movie rental place before they closed to rent Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, which we'd both seen before but looked like it might be interesting with the drugs.Tom doesn't recall having been at the video store at all and only vaguely remembers driving to his house from there. We walked in and Tom fell to the floor of his living room and stayed there, asleep. I didn't notice he was sleeping until perhaps 1:15, I was so into the movie. My highs were still in almost full affect with the exception os the weed. I decided to go to the porch and smoke a bowl by myself.Next thing I remember was puking at 1:45 and crawling to the couch to go to sleep. I awoke at 3:45 and puked again but then decided to try and settle my stomach with some Cheerios. Tom awoke and sat with me, very groggy and still probably half stoned. We slept until about eleven the next morning and tried to recall just what had happened. We pieced together most of the experience from the shattered pices that we remembered. What I learned from this experience was 1) how really stupid we were to get in an automobile and 2) that just because you think you know how substances might work together you shouldn't do it. I rarely endorse mixing any substance with another with the exception of pot.The mindset started out as 'let's get railed' and turned into 'let's try to make sense of what is coming our way.' It can be scary to be somewhere uncomfortable while under the influence of something new. And despite what you may have heard about only having bad experiences (read as shitty trips) with psychedelics, you can have a pretty rotten time with crossing pills. Extreme paranoia and disorientation will make you do some pretty crazy stuff.Overall, I'd say it was a fairly positive experience, especially swimming (floating would be more accurate).Just watch what you put into yourself and watch what comes out of your mouth as well. I had quite a bit of experience with DXM in the past. I had grown used to the effects of a second and third plateau trip, but what I was about to get myself into I could have never imagined outside of a dream. LSD had taken me far in the past, showing me things I thought impossible, but this trip on DXM... Well, I still don't know what to think of it.It all started earlier that night at the grocery store. While picking up my weekly supply of mac & cheese and ramen noodles, I ran across the pharmaceutical section. Robotussin Maximum Strength Cough syrup caught my eye and I thought, 'What the heck. Its been awhile since I gave this stuff a try.' I grabbed three 6oz. bottles, made my purchases and headed back to my apartment.I decided that since I was going to take such a large dose, it would be best to do it late at night when no one would disturb me. No dinner for me that night, I knew from experience that it was easier to drink robo on an empty stomach to avoid nausea. I set all three of my alarm clocks ahead of schedule so that I'd be sure to be up in time for class the next day at 5:00 PM. After taking the phone off the hook, I poured all three bottles of cough syrup into a large mug. Because I had had previous bad experiences with Vicks 44, I can't just chug the stuff and get it over with. If I do, I get sick. So I decided to turn on the television, smoke a cigarette and take my time.Beginning at about 9:00 PM., the effects started to set in roughly forty-five minutes later. All but about an inch and a half of cough syrup was left in the glass. Forcing myself to take another gulp, I realized that I couldn't finish it all off without something to cut the nausea. Around 10:30, I shuffled into my kitchen and pulled out my stash box from the closet. A warm, fuzzy feeling started to overtake me and then the infamous robo itch set in. In between breaking up the weed and loading the pipe, I would stop to scratch my arms and head which were itching like hell. I noticed my motor coordination beginning to fade when I took a small hunk of raw opium from its bag and added it to the bowl as a finishing touch.Standing wasn't an option anymore. My legs began to feel numb so I took a seat back in front of the TV and sparked up the bowl. After awhile, the bowl needed a stir, which had become a real effort since I was having trouble keeping in touch with my own body. Somehow, I managed to finish it, drank a little more cough syrup and gagged again. I was able to struggle out of my chair, make it to the kitchen sink and pour what was left of the cough syrup down the drain. My stomach felt queasy again and, overall, I felt like shit. The horrid cough syrup taste wouldn't leave my mouth, which also felt numb,  so (and I don't know why I did this, but I remember doing it) I stumbled over to the refrigerator, took out the Jagermeister, and had myself three shots. Remarkably, I didn't throw up.I was feeling a little better after that, so, robo walking all the way, I plopped back down in my big comfy chair and had me a cigarette even though all desire to smoke had left me. The consequences of my Robo drinking were really starting to come on strong now. There was so much delay between the strobing visual effects that it felt like I was in complete blurry darkness for seconds at a time. The ceiling fan, which was on, was starting to bother me, being just out of my range of vision, so I reached over and turned it off by the switch on the wall. This is when things began to get interesting.While smoking my cigarette, I passed out momentarily, dropping the lit cancer stick on the floor. Not a good thing. Realizing I had done this, I grabbed it up quickly, burning myself (I think), and haphazardly put it out in the ashtray. Moments after doing that, I passed out again. I felt myself fall through the floor and then there was this strange feeling that my eyes had been opened up by some unknown force. I couldn't hear anything, even the TV that was still on. I was in a jungle, somewhere in Peru, and after walking through the thick underbrush for some time, I came upon what looked like a large temple. There was this old Native American guy chanting in front of it and he stopped when he saw me and asked me why I had come. I don't know why I replied like this (even though I'm a big mythology buff), but I said to him, 'I'm looking for Coyote. Do you know where I can find him?' The old man laughed and cast a warm-hearted grin in my direction, 'Oh, that Old Man Coyote. He's a tricky one. To find him, you must catch him.'I snapped back into my body like a broken rubber band. I was panting like I had just ran a marathon and I was almost positive that I was going to die. I half stumbled/crawled over to my cordless phone and picked it up. Then I remembered that it was unplugged and would do me no good. Out of disappointment, I tossed the phone over my shoulder and hobbled over to my bed where I crashed face down. Next to my bed, I had a notebook and a pen. I managed to open to a blank page and scribble nearly illegibly into it, 'Note to self: Dissociatives are called dissociatives for a REASON!'Once again, I went under. The desert was vast and hot. I could feel, smell, hear, and taste everything around me. In the expanse of the sand, I heard a coyote howl at the full moon in the sky (the sun was also present). I turned around to see a set of glowing green eyes in the distance followed by the laugh of a jester. Drawing up tangible power from around me, I darted after the distant coyote that was on now on the run. It felt like I was going at light speed. Jumping over one of the dunes, all which lay before me melted away into a black void. Desperately trying to stop myself from falling, I screamed at the top of my lungs and then the oddest thing happened to me. I was awake again for a split second from the shout, but my mind was still falling and I felt the little consciousness which had been lent to my body for that brief moment slip back down into the void to rejoin the rest of me like the last few grains of sand through an hourglass. After what seemed like an eternity, I hit the bottom of the void, landing on my back. It was an incredibly soft landing, as if I had fallen on a billion feathers. A great white light enveloped all around me and I opened my eyes. Sitting above me was the coyote looking down. It put one of its paws on my chest and then backed up for me while I tried to regain my footing. It sat and stared at me and for a brief moment, I understood everything the coyote was about. It was as if I had become the coyote.I woke up again, feeling as sober as a priest, around 4:30 in the morning. I got up, had myself a glass of water and returned to bed, completely bewildered by what had just happened. At least it felt like it had just happened.I now consider the coyote one of my Spirit animals. But beyond that, I gained instant respect for DXM. It's extremely powerful and can be used for creative and destructive purposes. I had talked to modern Shaman who had used DXM before. Usually I would just laugh and brush off their warnings. Unlike LSD, DMT, shrooms, etc., DXM grabs you by the ear and drags you along for the ride. If you're looking for a drug for religious workings, Shamanistic work, or out-of-body experiences, then by all means try a large dose of DXM. You may find it very useful. However, as for the upper plateaus as a recreational dosage, I'd advise you to think again. You may not know what you're getting yourself into. Let me first start by saying that I am a novice to alcohol (or any drugs, for that matter).  The experience I am about to tell you was approximately my sixth time ever getting drunk . . . which would explain my complete and utter stupidity.My previous few experiences with this particular liquor (Bacardi Limon) were mild at best.  I began slowly, starting at three shots and so on.  But I was never feeling the drunk I was craving.  A good buzz that would disappear too quickly.  This was not acceptable if I wanted to enter the club scene.  My drunks were weak and short-lived, unless mixed with another alcohol such as vodka or beer.To add to it, my tolerance to the fluid was building quite quickly.  Soon, six shots would hold the same effect as three.Finally, I said 'Fuck it' and purchased 12 shots from a friend.  (Dosage confusion arises here.  Twelve 1 oz. shots should obviously equal 12 oz.  But it filled a 16.9 oz. bottle nearly to the top.  Still trying to figure it out.)Did I plan on finishing the entire bottle in one night?  Not exactly.As soon as the night began, I was pumped.  I thought it would be nice to get piss-drunk for a change, so I started downing the bastards one after the other.  I mean, I would literally take another shot directly after the previous, using only swift sips of O.J. to mask the bitter taste.  I do not know what got into me, but I was a madman.About thirty minutes or less had passed before I had destroyed the entire 16.9 oz. bottle.  Was I insane?  Apparently I had underestimated the power of liquor. . . .'Whoa,' I said, spinning.  'I need to get this drunk *every* night!'  I did not realize that the effects I was receiving -- which were pretty fucking strong -- were as a result of only about a fourth of what I had consumed.  The first fourth, hehe.'It hasn't hit you yet, bro.'And that is when I choked.  It had occured to me that I was about to take a journey.  A long and miserable journey that I never want to encounter again.That exchange in dialogue was the last thing I remember. . . .Suddenly, I wake up outside on the concrete in the freezing cold.  I hear a vaccuum cleaner whining inside.  I hear people in a silly tone of voice, but with a hint of panic.  What the hell just happened?What sucks is that I only remember the HORRIBLE part of the night.  The part where I attempted to recover from what was probably alcohol poisoning.  I am covered in puke.  People are around me, feeding me water, taking pictures, laughing, staring, asking questions (like I can answer them).  Out of nowhere, vomit sprays from my mouth.  This is not a case where you can control it.  I felt no warning signs that I was about to puke.  It just fell out.  And the worst part was that it was all over me.I was in such terrible condition that I was literally laying in my own puke.  The icing on the cake was that it was on my new clothes I had purchased just hours earlier!  The smell was rancid, and the people around me were going nuts (all while laughing and thinking it to be 'cool').  I heard hacking in the background.  My friend was also puking, only it sounded more like prolonged dry heaves.  Oh, the sight it was!The night was long.  I mean, the longest, most miserable night I can recall.  The fact that it was freezing did not help much either.  The most potent simile I can conjur up would be that I felt as though I was going through heroin withdrawal.It is not fun to sleep in your own puke on hard concrete in winter weather.  Especially when that constant feeling of 'I'm going to vomit again' is hovering over you.  When I woke up (yes, I slept there all night and even got up to go inside and piss!), I felt that if I moved to go home, which was quite a distance, I would hurl again.  But I eventually forced myself to ride my bike back without a shirt on.The next day was torture as well.  I *had* to eat, no doubt, but when I ate, I puked.  I was sick and tired all day.  The alcohol was taking its sweet-ass time to free me from my personal Hell.To add to the pain, I was slave to the people whose house I painted with vomit.  I had to scrub up the stank all day.  And washing the shirt that spent a night soaking in throw-up was not an easy task either.  The experience was NOT what I would call 'cool'.Little blanks here and there were filled in by my friends.  They said I was doing all kinds of stupid things.  I was wobbling around, knocking over people's drinks, staring blankly at uniform objects.  What is so odd -- and I have never before experienced this -- was that I do not remember a goddamn thing.  Besides getting punched in the balls (which still hurt), the heroin withdrawal feeling (wish I forgot), and a few minutes of following my friends around (annoying them, I guess), it is all a blank.  Especially hurling all over their living room floor!Looking back on it is fun, sure, but the experience was a mess.  Sure, I now have a rep for being an insane drinker (remember, my tolerance is low, as well as my body weight) . . . but I would never want to go through it again.  Smelling Bacardi brings home memories -- I doubt I will drink it any time soon.I have (crime scene) pictures to show my grandkids, and we all get a kick out of laughing about it.  However, I would take this as a warning:  ALCOHOL IS A POWERFUL DRUG!  My first time alco-puking will hopefully be my last! This case happened a few months ago when my boyfriend and I went to a popular club to meet up with some friends.  At the time 'G' was something of a new item and everyone was really interested in what it did when brought into the club atmosphere.  So everyone was using it recreationally--1 capful for every 45 minutes, max.My boyfriend was the only that had not taken any.  Instead, he was just drinking beer, but by like 3:00am he decided that he wanted to take some too.  The only problem was that he had been drinking fairly heavily and by this time I guess he felt untouchable.  So without my total knowledge, he took what we estimated to be like 5-6 capfuls in about 2 hours.  The 'caps' were said to have been watered down, that is why the dosage was so great.Well, about 30 minutes later he grabbed some other girl's crotch, which was totally out of character for him.  He was hanging off of the lights on the ceiling and had stripped down to only his pants.  Now this club is pretty forgiving about weird shit happening, but what comes next is unforgivable.I look over at 'subject' and he is taking his pants down.  I run over because this is not a good sign.  As I get there he is pulling out his unspeakables and peeing all over the people in the booth below us.  Thank god they thought that it was a beer or they would have probably killed us all.  The next thing I know I have his pants up but during the process, he tripped on the cuff of his pants and landed head first on the iron banister.  Bad goes to worse in like 2 seconds.  'Subject' is now unconscious, bleeding profusely from his face and I do not know what the hell to do.  I turn around to ask one of my friends what to do and everyone is gone.  They all took off, afraid I guess of what was about to happen.  So I tried to feed him ice and water and bribe him with sexual favors and such to get any reaction out of him while trying to see where all the damned blood was coming from.  Now granted, at the time I took G myself, so I could hardly see straight and this sucked.By this time the people below us have realized they have been pissed on and they call all of the bouncers and they come and drag him off, pants down to his ankles, bleeding all over everyone, unconscious.This was the worst night of my life.  I watched the love of my life get tubes shoved down every hole in his face and watched him wake up wondering what the hell was going on.  I watched him get stitches in his mouth.  All because we did not listen to anyone's advice that this drug can kill you.  Granted, it can give you a good time...it can also cause you to gag on your own vomit and all your friends will watch you die.....I have seen it happen.I talked to the bouncer about the night of the above incident...'subject' was the 7th person taken to ER that night from GHB.  Two weeks later a girl died in the club from too much G.  DOSE: 1 tablet oral MDMA (pill / tablet) \\xa0 1 tablet oral MDMA (pill / tablet)            BODY WEIGHT:   125 lb         I was queen of drugs at one time.  I could take twice as much as the next guy and still walk and talk.  I was a very respected druggy.  But as i got older I decided it was time to quit and focus on school.  But there was one drug left that I had never tried, and had always wanted to.  Two years after I had quit all drugs I was playing pool and flirting with two very cute guys whom I had never met before.  Me and Jon got along great, but these were still just strangers I had met that day. When they mentioned they were picking up E that night I jumped at the chance to try it.  They informed me that it was white mitsubishi they were getting.We went to a bar that I had never been to before, and didn't know anyone there, but they knew almost everyone!  We dosed around 11:00pm.  While waiting for it to hit me, I had 3 rum and cokes to help me socialize. BAD idea.  I later learned never to drink with E.  At 11:30 I felt the most powerful feeling (induced by drugs) of my whole life hit me like someone punched me in the face.  I was literally knocked on my ass!  I had to sit down on the picnic tables they had lined up around the dance floor.  Jon saw that I was completely mesmerized by people trying to talk to me.  I was trying to understand what they were saying but all I heard were notes and murmurs.  Their voices faded in and out.  Jon came and sat in front of me, saying, 'Isn't this nice?  Lauren, do you want me to touch you?' I just smiled and nodded yes.  Then the second guy sat behind me and started rubbing my back. Every touch felt like a million little orgasms running through my body.  I felt that I didn't want to be in public with these guys touching me.  I must have said I want to leave, even though I don't remember talking.  I was having trouble walking, stumbling like being drunk, so Jon grabbed my arm and the other guy walked behind me.  As we were leaving everything and everyone looked like they were made of tiny pixel squares.  Like they were all pictures on a computer screen blown up too big.  I think it was just the eye twitching that can tend to happen.  As soon as I stepped outside the cold winter air hit me, and I had never felt cold like that before.  The walk to the car seemed to take forever.  Jon kept saying reassuring things about how we'll be in the car soon, I'll keep you warm, don't worry.  In the car I asked how the guy could drive if he was as messed up as I was.  He said he was practically sober, only a little high, but nothing like I was feeling. Probably because he had done it many times before.One we got to Jon's, around 12:15 my peek had gotten even a little more intense if possible.  We went into his basement where he had a futon.  (At this point I can only remember bits and pieces of the rest of my night). Jon opened the futon for me to lie down on, and that's what I did.  I remember him asking if he could kiss me, my jaw kind of hurt, but I said yes.  His lips felt like marshmallows without the taste.  They seemed to cover my whole mouth, making it as sensitive as my clit.  It felt so good, and I wanted to tell him that but I could no longer talk.  He kept bringing me water, and forcing me to take sips.  Then, for a long while after that, I blacked out, and the next thing I remember is having him on top of me, having sex.  I had lost a lot of feeling in my whole body for some reason, so it felt good, but only the parts that I could feel.  I remember thinking this is wrong, I just met this guy, why aren't I shouting 'NO!'. But I found no answer to my question and let him continue pleasuring me, orally too.  I could hear him having a conversation  his friend who was seated on the couch behind my head, but their words were still just murmurs. Then Jon said to me, 'Are you sure my friend can join? You're not going to get mad tomorrow?' He later told me to every question he would ask I would just stare at him, then murmur something that had no relevance to his question.   I remember Jon saying my name off in the distance, and asking if it still feels good.  'Isn't this amazing?!' he would say.  His words and the feeling of his body would drift so far away, I couldn't hear or feel him, then they would come back.  About 3:00 am, his friend was standing over me, asking if I was coming down yet, I said yes, even though I was still in that euphoric state and couldn't distinguish objects clearly.  He put another pill in my mouth and fed me water to wash it down.  I spilled water down my naked chest and started to complain how cold I was, so he put the blanket over me and was rubbing me to try to warm me up.  I don't know exactly where Jon was, he could have still been on top of me for all I know, but all I could say was, 'I'm cold'.  I lost time again, and when my ears would let words in again, Jon was asking me to get on top of him.  I got on top and put his penis inside of me, but I don't think I was moving my hips.  His friend that came up from behind me and grabbed my waist, moving my body in the riding motion.   I just closed my eyes, and tried to hear what they were saying to each other.  For some reason I kept wondering if Jon was enjoying this, I think I asked him, and he said it was the most amazing experience of his life.  I kept my eyes closed for what seemed like hours of riding him.  Then, I figure the second E hit me, I just slumped over and all I wanted to do was sleep.  Jon told his friend to lie me on my back and keep me covered up.  He was mean in saying, 'So she doesn't complain about being cold anymore.'  I guess I mustn't have stopped saying that since walking out to the car.  His friend was telling him not to let me sleep cause I could die.  I remember feeling scared, and thought I didn't care if I died, all I wanted to do was sleep.  I was being told to rub Jon's body, while his friend was rubbing mine, under the blanket this time.  The last time I had looked at the clock it as around 5:00am, and I just couldn't stay awake any longer.  In my sleep I heard his friend leave, and felt Jon comforting me in my sleep.  The next day he told me even in my sleep I was mumbling weird things about being cold, and making sure everyone was have a good time.  The feeling I had just from the ecstasy alone was a million little orgasms running through my body.  I don't think Jon brought me to an orgasm even with all his effort to.The next day I woke up feeling burnt out.  I threw my cloths on, my legs were still wobbly, and ran to the bathroom and chugged at least a litre of water.  I still couldn't seem to talk.  My jaw was sore, and I couldn't think of words to say to this 20 year old, (I am 18), with whom I'd just met and slept with all in the same day.To the best of my knowledge, his friend never penetrated me, and I hope that's true.  Jon promised me he used a condom the whole time, and I hope that's true too.  That whole night to me remains a mix of emotions. Erotic, frightening, scary, sexually arousing to think about, and some parts, still a mystery. I've used ecstasy many times since then, but only in rave scenes, with close friends there for support and safety. I suggest you always have a friend with you who you can trust and is staying sober. This was my third and probably best experience with codeine. I still had pills left over from when i had wisdom tooth extraction, and I had been using them as shortcuts to getting totally ripped by combining them with alcohol, especially when I was broke. On this instance, I was a frat party with a bunch of my girlfriends. I took two pills at around 11:00 p.m. or so, and proceeded to have several drinks: a Sex on the Beach, whiskey sour, a poorly made Zombie, and a very disgusting Tequila Sunrise. Mind you, I drank these over the course of the nite, not all at once! It took about 40 minutes before I started feeling the distinct codeine buzz: kind of out of nowhere, you start to feel real happy and mellow, and drunk, but in a more clearheaded, unsloppy sort of way. You don't get those heavy legs or slurring words, and your balance is seemingly unaffected. This time around, however, I experienced an additional effect I had not previously experienced: my body felt good, similar to ecstasy but obviously not as intense. This lasted for a good portion of the night, and it felt great. This is the one very noticeable and unpleasant things about doing codeine, though: you can tell the very instant your buzz is going away. It's not gradual at all; all of a sudden, boom, the ride is over, and then all you feel is extremely hammered and heavy. And the worst part: the nausea kicks in, and it doesn't go lightly on you either. At the point this occurred, I ate this ham and cheese sandwhich (which tasted unusually delicious for some reason)and for a few minutes I felt better, but then the nausea came right back. Then I had hiccups for about 45 minutes, and was generally in a gross mood. Everyone else was drunk and annoying me half to death. The whole ride lasted maybe four hours. Then i dragged myself home and passed out, still feeling so nauseous that I wished i had never heard of codeine. The next day I felt exhausted, but personally, I attribute this a lot more to the alcohol than the codeine. Alcohol always makes me feel like crap the next day. I still have not taken codeine by itself. However, if you are going to drink with it, i wouldn't recommed taking a greater dose than the 30 mg. I am pretty sure that anything more would have had me throwing up all night. All in all, though, I am sick of codeine. Personally, the nausea just ruins it for me. I like more intense mind blowing things like geltabs and good ecstasy better; I don't drink very often and don't go for downers and tranquilizers. However, if things like valium and percoset are your thing, give codeine a try; you may like it as well. At the time of this story me and my best mate were sixth form students. It was a normal old boring Sunday and we did not know what to do. He said that he was up for getting completely shit faced, he thought it was a funny thing to do as we both had school the following day and we would have to go in hung over. I was not so sure but agreed none the less. Me and him had been pissed loads of times in the past, there was no way we knew how many times, but none were comparable to the level of pissedness that we got this night.  We went down the off license and purchased a 700 millilitre bottle of vodka, a bottle of coke to drink it with and 5 stellas each. This was the amount we would usually drink to get completely fucked. We went back to his bedroom and started  drinking the vodka. It was then that I realised how up for getting pissed my mate was (I had never seen him this eager before). He mixed the vodka and coke for us in large glasses, and he was using far more vodka than coke. I don`t like drinking it like this but just thought, “you only live once” and matched his pace. A while later we were near the end of the bottle of vodka, with loads of coke left, due to the concentration we were drinking it. I was beginning to feel pissed and knew that once I drank the beers I would be shit faced. My mate then surprised me yet again with his alcoholic urges: He suggested going to buy a second 700 millilitre bottle of vodka! I don`t know whether he expected me to turn his suggestion down as I was not initially up for getting so pissed due to school being the following morning but thought “fuck it” and agreed. We biked back down the off license and bought the next bottle. We were both also into pornography at that time and as we were a bit pissed bought 2 porno mags each from the off license! (fucking perverts). We went back to his house and consumed the rest of the vodka, of which I do not really remember. WE HAD DRANK 700 MILLILITRES OF VODKA EACH! This state of mind was blinding (beyond any drunk state possible from beer). As we were drinking in his room and his Dad was in and we were so fucked we took the 10 beers out with us and the pornos and went for a walk. I haven`t a clue how many beers we actually drank but I know we had quite a few each, maybe even all of them. I also do not know exactly where we walked.On the walk I remember we started getting up to some really stupid stuff. I think it was about 9 o clock during spring time so still light. The first thing we did was pulled up a stupid ornament from someones front garden that had been pissing us off for weeks and lobbed it into a bush. I then saw a women walking into a house and shouted at her to come and look at this. As she started walking towards us I opened one of my pornos up and showed it to her. She must have been really insulted and turned back to walk into the house. As she did so I shouted to her “Aren't you a lesbian then?” and then “Do you want a shag?”. I then had a stupid idea to go and knock on doors and ask women for sex. We did this a few times to complete strangers but men mainly opened the door I think so I said I had got the wrong house. After a while of this me and my mate decided to go back to his house. On the way back down his road I collapsed in one of his neighbours front gardens and started puking. He got me to get up but I was lost in a front garden and started walking round in circles! My mate was trying to get me out but had no luck. The owner of the house then came out, my mate told him that I was drunk. The man helped me back to my mates house and even picked up my pornos and left them next to my mates front door for me!My mate got me in and lent me out his window for me to be sick out of. There is a roof outside his window which I covered in sick. Soon after puking I fell unconscience on his floor. A few minutes later the police knocked on my mates door saying there had been complaints about us. (Anyone could have reported us). My mate explained that I was now asleep and that he was going to sleep now. I woke up in the morning lying on my mates hard floor without a top on lying in my own sick. The window was open and I was shivering like fuck. I had the worst hangover I think anyone has ever experienced, I was not sure whether I was awake or not! Like fuck me and my mate were going to school. My mate woke and we planned to bunk school and planned on sleeping all day when his dad came in saying he had the day off work. (This fucked our plans right up). He was in a right mood having being kept awake all night and made me get his ladder out and climb up onto the roof outside my mates window and clean all the sick off it, (not the sort of thing you want to do with a hangover of all hangovers). Anyway I did it and we had to pretend to go to school as his dad was to be at home all day. We went to the close by recreation ground were we slept for three hours on the grass (it was lovely). We then later on (when school had finished), went back to our own houses and slept. I was hung over for the next two days and my stomach was still fucked after that. I must say that I do drink a lot but have never been anywhere near that drunk before and have not been since (this happened 1 year ago). I think the secret for getting so pissed was: - drinking on an empty stomach,- not expecting to get pissed until just before I did it,- not thinking of the consequences (such as being sick),- drinking almost straight vodka,- drinking 700 millilitres of it quickly,- having quite a few beers after it even though I was already fucked.Not pleasant. It all started on a Saturday morning. I and two of my friends 'G' and 'A' had planned this for a week to get loaded and just have fun. I had heard all the stories about being drunk at school and said to myself 'I had to try this'. So I get up and go out for the whole morning coming back and recieving 'the call' from my friend. So I ask my Mom to take me over (I'm 15 yrs. old at this time) and she says to me 'Aren't you gonna eat dinner'. DAMN! This is what I didn't want as I want to keep my stomach empty, as I heard an empty stomach increases drunkeness. So i scarf down a small pizza and out the door I go.    I arrived at 'A's' house and he had some stuff to do so while he did that my other friend 'G' arrived with the booze by bike. On the list of liquids we had to consume it was:Me = Colt .45 (1.5 Litres), 1 Vodka Juice bottleA  = Vodka (1 Pint), Pop MixG  = Vodka Juice, Strawberry DarquirisI had chosen Colt .45 because as a teenager I have very limited finances($5 for it). Plus there are stories of how 1 bottle of it gets you very 'plastered'. There is one very down side effect to it, its taste has been compared to 'rat piss'.So once with got all together we went back to A's camp in the woods. We sat down on a stolen coach and matress' and started to drink. About a quater of the way through my bottle I said 'this ain't doin nothing'(I'm a pretty big guy so that may be a reason). So I started to walk out of the camp to get some air about 30 minutes into it. This is when it started to kick in, my vision went to slow motion as I turned my light-head. I soon sat down again, 'A' told a story about his brother opening a door and that just set us off laughing for about 4 minutes straight. As we consumed more liquids 'A' pulled out his combat knife and stabbed the coach, this bewilderd me so I tried it and laughed. 'G' not wanting to be left out took the knife and demolished a press-wood table with constant blows. Warning: Don't keep sharp objects around drunks.So as I get to the bottom quarter of the bottle we decide to go wander the community for fun. Before we could do that 'G' felt the need to climb the camp. Being made by 15 year old boys it wasn't the safest structure. As soon as he reached the roof a 18' inch diameter log with a spike in it came crashing down missing my head with the nail striking the bottle. Out of my superior judgement all I cold say was 'My Colt!' as I picked up the the bottle and drank the remaining contents.It is now 1 hour into the experiences and we try to make our way out of the woods so we start to walk and come to a 70 degree climb. My friend made it up no problem where as my body chooses the prime time to give out half way up. As i tumbled down the gravel slate filled path I skinned my palms and landed on my belly. I made a seconded attempt and ended crawling up the path. As we came to the streets my friends told me to act 'cool' as to not alert neighbors. I said okay, but it seemed my way of doing this involved tellin my body directly out loud. As we walked down the street I was playing therapist with my body. Once that was done I noticed that my view was slanted and I realized my walk was off as I tripped over a crub onto some guys lawn.Strangley, during this whole experience there was two 'me's' one being the wacked out drunk, and the other being the sensible scientific mind. For about a half hour I tried to comprehend this phenomenah through words but to no avail. As we walked some more we came along a 11 yr. old kid on a bike. We started to talk for a while and convinced him to come to the woods with us. When we arrived we gave him two shots of vodka. Well, this gave us another companion to roam the night with. We tried riding his bike but ended up leaning and only going in circles.We soon took to the streets again and we with me walking ability soon tumbled over another curb, only this time it led to a ditch where only my head submerged into a small swamp. As I pulled my soaked head out of the marsh my friends just laughed. So we continued to walk around until 'A' decided to go in so then it was left to 'G' and me to walk home. We took this time to sober up but not before stealing some guys bags of leaves and throwing it off a bridge.So I finally made it to a phone where I called my Dad to pick me up. I still had a small buzz but not much as I got into the car. My Dad asked me why I was coming home so I made up some excuse bout 'A' getting into a fight with his brother. We got home and as I tried to walk up my steps inside the house where i fell. Luckily my Dad wasn't in yet and i quickly went to the bathroom. That's when I saw IT. Half of my hair was sticking up in mow-hawk fashion. It was from the marsh incident and it had hardened into a point and I had been driven home like that. So I deduced that my parents knew i now drank so I said 'use it to your favour' and now I do it about once every 4 months. It all started one night when me and my buddies (mind you we are underage, age 16-18) were out looking for alchohol..  with no luck...  we find a friend in town who gives us these motion sickness pills, 'equate' i think.. so we proceed to take them then head home, taking 12 as he says to 'get a good buzz like alchohol'... we wait, an hour comes still nothing... so me and another one of my buddies take more.. i end up taking 17 (50 mg dimenhydrinate each) and he takes 15...  we take some whisky we found in his dads cabinet, me 1 shot him 2... still nothing.. i was thinking, 'dammit these are worthless' i had been feeling an odd emtpy feeling but nothing totally different from what i usually felt at 1 am with nothing to do except try to watch porn through the static on skinamax... so i go home and go straight to bed.i wake up at prolly around 1:30 or 2 having to pee really bad, i get up out of my bed really quick (bunk bed, i sleep on bottom) and fall flat on my face.. my legs felt as if each one weighed a ton and my head felt like it wasn't there.  i find my way to standing position and am like.. ok these effects suck.  i stumble to the bathroom, and my eyes I see in the mirror are so fucked, all red and all..  i was thinking damn i od'd...  then i here my mom giggling in the roomwith dad talking to her, so i turn off the light and creep around in there, hearing voices saying my name.. so i was like 'oh shit they know i do drugs, they are worried' so i go in there trying to figure out what the hell they are talking about. i see nothing but them sleeping as usual... and then the voices stop as i get closer.  so i go back to my bed, jump in, only to wake up as if i hadn't slept... hearing them talking quietly, my name occasionally, and i had to pee again. so i went to the bathroom quietly hearing them talk louder and louder then quiet completely.this went on til prolly around 4 am.  then i wake up at about 5:45 it is a bit light out and i hear two voices at the end of my bed saying look at that spider chasing that moth.. and i look and there is a spider chasing a moth.. i jump out of bed and i start seeing these streams of flys or something like that streaming around the carpet, pretty cool shit, i could feel them hit my feet like fish nibbling toes... i would catch myself talking to people that weren't there, mainly my buddie down the street.. i would be talking to the tv and all the sudden it would stop talking to me and i would get pissed... i would wake up in a conversation with my electric globe lighting thing...  i saw spiders all around (note i hate spiders) I saw spiders in my bed again, so i didn't go to bed.. my coordination was also fucked.. i couldn't even reach to things right.. couldn't direct hands...  it was interesting, but then i had a horrible hangover the next day.. all day. How come there are no experiences with alcohol on here?!?  I guess I'll be the first to educate some of you considering drinking.This was my first actual experience recreationally using drugs (other than cigarettes).  My parents didn't drink, so I couldn't get my hands on any beer, but they did keep two bottles of Seagrams 7 80 proof whiskey in the cabinet (and they never drank it, so I was in the clear for sneaking it away).  I also have extremely strong willpower and my parents aren't drinkers so I figured that I didn't have much of a chance to become an alcoholic.When I first poured myself a little cup, I nearly threw it up with one sip.  I wasn't expecting this awful tasting, warm, burning liquid to tear my throat up.  I threw the cup away, and put the liquor back.  I didn't think it would be that bad ...After talking with my friends, and telling them how bad it was, I was reassured that it would pay off if I got drunk.  Well, me being the curious teenager, I decided to drink with the goal of getting drunk.  I was going to do it, no matter what.  So, one night, I snuck a bottle up to my room, and poured myself a giant glass of it.  I also brought up a cold glass of milk to try to get past some of that horrible taste.  I swallowed one mouthful and managed to keep it down.  I waited about five minutes (to settle the burning in my stomach and throat) and took another mouthful.  Ugh ... I kept asking myself why I was doing this, and I kept in mind that it SHOULD be worth it.  I soon finished the glass, returned the bottle/glasses and sat on my bed, watched some TV (wrestling.  why?  I have no idea) and waited for the effects to start.  About a half an hour into it, I started feeling a pleasant, buzzing feeling in my head.  I thought that this would be it, but I was wrong.  45 Minutes into my buzz, It really started.  My head started spinning, and my eyes were having trouble focusing and adjusting.  It was basically like my brain was slowing down (which is what alcohol does).  I was VERY comfortable, laying on my bed, swinging my head back and forth, watching my vision try to keep up with my movements.  It was awesome.  I didn't really have many physical effects, other than a slight numbing feeling on my skin.  Most of it was my mind being slurred.  I couldn't concentrate on the TV with all of these new sensations I was feeling (of course not).    I thought about all those drunks on TV that always stumble around, and thought it would be funny if I tried to walk. (note: I was laying down when I decided this, so I first had to sit up) When I thrust myself up, I couldn't stop, and fell over again.  It was very hard to sit up straight without continuing over.  I finally managed to hold myself up, and I stood up.  Like I said before, my vision lagged behind what I was actually doing, so I thought I was walking fine, but I was really falling all over the place.  Awesome feeling.  I fell face first on my bed, and I was laughing my ass off.  I don't really know why, it was just funny.  It was probably because I thought of what I was doing, and I probably thought it was funny as hell to be watching myself. I was mumbling, and laughing for about 15 minutes straight. After that, I started to compose myself. I felt the buzz wearing off now, but I was still kinda slow and 'dead headed'.  All in all, the whole experience lasted about 2 and a half hours.  I loved it.  I didn't really have any worries or thoughts about anything.  It was a great experience.  I didn't have a hangover the next day, there was no abnormal peeing or puking or whatnot ... although, when I told my friends that I downed a big glass of whiskey, they were shocked.  They told me that whiskey would knock you on your ass (they just drink beer to get drunk).  They were right, I was knocked on my ass ... it was great.  From this experience, I learned how come people actually become alcoholics (cause it's so damn fun/enjoyable).  I've only been drunk about 5 times in 1999, and right now, there are two empty bottles of whiskey in my parents cabinet that I have to come up with a solution for (lol).  Hopefully they won't find out until I'm 21 when I can reimburse them. :)  Hope this has been useful. I had woken up at 6am after a night of drinking and I had taken a small amount of MDMA as well. I had around 10mg of moxy to my guess but it could of been much more as I had no scales and the dealer had said it was 50% stronger than the last batch. I was excited to try this as many of my friends who have little to no psychedelic experiences had told me it was amazing and the best drug they had ever had. I have taken acid twice, 2C-B twice and done quite a few trips on shrooms with the highest dose being 7 grams. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my trips and always leave them learning new things and having slight mystical experiences. It was 6:40am when I swallowed the bitter tasting jelly.+15 minutes- I start feeling pretty nauseous and get a very uncomfortable body load (I have pectus excavatum so my chest capacity is pretty restricted which didn't help with the extremely increased heartrate)+20 minutes- Holy shit I am tripping fucking balls.The patterns I see on my wall are identical to my last shroom trip. Everything is morphing and breathing, just the usual visuals but they are pretty intense. I start to get very hot and I start feeling very uncomfortable and jittery but this is only physically. I decide to go for a cold shower and it felt amazing but I still have this horrible body load which now starts to freak me out. I get out of the shower and lie in bed for around 10 minutes and put on some music which sounds good but pretty distorted and trippy. +40 minutes- I now wish I hadn't done this as the physical discomfort is now really affecting me mentally and I keep thinking about waking up my mum to get some benzos and carbamazepines just to shut the trip down and sleep it off. I decide against this and go to my kitchen and I pour a glass of gin and drink this. I find myself looking out the window and feeling good and then I come up with a great plan-Go for a walk! (whenever I have felt uncomfortable on trips I find that nature totally cures me whenever I have felt uncomfortable on trips I find that nature totally cures me). After I stroke my cats for a few minutes while I am still tripping hard but I am much more chilled out after the gin I go to my room and get dressed.+1 hour- I head out for my walk and I have already planned my route. I find that walking feels amazing and I look at the clouds and it felt as if I was as tall at them and that I could see in front of them and behind them if that makes any sense. I get to the woods I was heading to which has a river that leads to the beach. Halfway through the woods I stop and close my eyes and I feel a total feeling of oneness and it is extremely pleasurable. One thing I notice that I keep saying to myself in my head or so it seems is 'you need to be careful what you are saying/thinking in these realms' (which I'm sure has happened on previous trips) and another thought which was 'I am glad to be welcomed to this realm and I never want to leave' (note that I am a pretty spiritual person).+1 hour 30- I head along to a cliffside and sit on a bench for a while and I admire the sea and my town and I start coming down slowly as the visuals decrease but I am still in a great psychedelic headspace.+2 hours 30- I make it home finally after going to a shop and buying cigarettes (which was very hard to do), my mum comes into my room to say that she is leaving and I am still tripping as her face is morphing.After this I come down gradually but pretty quickly. My experience has been pretty good but I won't be using this again as it was pretty straining physically as my chest I still sore as my heart has been beating very hard and fast. It is now 3pm and I can still see the pattern on my wall if I concentrate a certain way which was pretty cool.(I have also been able to do this with the pattern I seen on acid even several months later). I thought my trip would of also lasted longer but it could be due to the fact that I drank the gin and also the past few months I have been abusing MDMA and cocaine and I am still battling this.

About 5mg before going out and I am full of energy and am able to drink quite a bit without blacking out or getting too stupid. I was using speed (amphetamine sulfate) to do this originally and I was really worried about my health. This is honestly much better. Anyway, I had gotten some MXE from a friend the day before and it was stored in the same container and type of baggie as my 4-HO. 7:00pm; T-1:30 -- Start pre-gaming, drink about 3 cups of wine punch and a beer8:30pm; T+0 -- I weighed out two 5mg doses of what I thought was 4-HO-MET and took one. It was at that point I realized that the baggie had a hole in it, which meant it was the MXE. I had a minor freakout, then remembered I had done 20mg and was perfectly functional, so 1/4 of an already small dose should be fine. Took 4-HO-MET and packed an extra dose and left. 9pm – 11pm -- Party was pretty fun, everything was very colorful, honestly didn't feel the MXE. Party progressed, I was going a little crazy at the shot bar. I can’t say how much I drank but it was a lot. Redosed 5mg of 4-HO-MET around 10:3011:00pm; T+2:30 -- 4-HO-MET alone I would have been fine but shit started to go a little south. I remember puking in the side yard, walking around mingling but being very confused. I pretty much lost my short-term memory. In retrospect it was 100% the MXE as I find it causes confusion. At some point I blacked out. This is what I was told I did during this time. My friend told me to steal this guy’s hat, I happily obliged. He got really upset, so I gave him his hat back. His friend was apparently really upset and he got in my face and started talking shit. At this point I regained control of myself. So I am standing there arguing with this guy and I have no clue what we are arguing about. So I just rolled with it, a part of me wanted to get in a fight with him. It cooled down a bit and my friend (different one) grabbed me and we left with another sober driver friend. They dropped me off at my apartment and I woke up in bed this morning unable to focus my vision (it's ok now). Turns out that guy and another group of people got in a fight on campus after they were driven back and ended up being arrested. So I was pretty lucky getting to leave early.Anyway, large amounts of alcohol and even a tiny dose of MXE is a terrible combination. Also remember to mark your baggies so you don't make the same mistake. I'm lucky I noticed because I would have taken another 5mg at the party. Another note: I actually feel pretty good today (writing this the day after). I find MXE has a great afterglow regardless of what experiences I have on it. Gabapentin and Alcohol WithdrawalsI had been suffering from severe convulsions in my lower body when lying down, so sleep was impossible - even after two days awake. I took the first dose, and sat on my laptop for a bit. Lay down, and still had some shakes. Repeat, and I was able to rest. Sleep still came hard, but there were no convulsions - I no longer felt a need to go to the hospital for detox.May not work for all, so still go to a hospital if you feel it's necessary to keep you alive - But it helped me. I find it hard to believe that anyone is using the word 'withdrawals' in referring to discontinuing kratom usage. For the record, I've been using kratom for 11 years. I stopped using it for 6 years and returned to it as a substitute for alcohol. This did work for a time, but my alcohol problem became such that nothing would substitute. When I finally quit drinking for the last time, the withdrawal symptoms were so bad that kratom, which I usually loved, made no difference. I couldn't even feel it. I was having audial and visual hallucination, puking...I finally went to the hospital after 3 days because after no sleep for 3 days, I was hearing voices mocking me. Went to the ER, got a shot of Valium, and had my friend get me a stash of klonopin to taper off. THAT is withdrawal. I take 2-3 doses of kratom a day, up to 30 grams a dose. Worst problem I ever had quitting was a runny nose and some irritability. My 'withdrawals' were 'cured' with 1/4 oz of mid-grade cannabis. Had a couple of bizarre reactions to this combo. Alcohol consumption basically to the point of a nice heavy buzz, Noopept was approximately 5-10mg. Basically I'd feel mentally alert but my judgement was way off, I'd do stupid crap and think I was the genius of the world. Now I've used Noopept many times before and it seems to heighten my thought process, so basically what happened when combined with Alcohol I had this weird lack of judgement. For me it was laughably stupid foibles but this could be seriously dangerous depending on what you were thinking. For me it was trying to reinvent a simple device, but if you thought jumping downstairs was a great idea you'd probably do it. Additionally sometimes I'd blackout at much less than normal tolerance. Unless you're safe with someone to watch you don't recommend this combo. Only positive attribute was next to no hangover.

Heavy drinker, occasional joint smoker.I'll decompose the trip in chunks of half an hour because this seems plausible but time was very distorted, so there may be inaccuracies. The dosages too are approximate, we didn't use a scale.[T=0]Had a few beers waiting for someone to arrive, it is about 8pm, feeling a little light-headed from the beers. The last guest arrives, and 3 of us insufflate about 15mg of MXE.[T+30m]Party goes on, all feeling the MXE kick in. The effect is mild, we are used to it, we know we'll take more.[T+1h]I need to go further, I have to wake up early in the morning so I don't wait any longer. I insufflate a second dose of about 15mg of MXE.[T+1h30]Starting to feel very relaxed and open-minded, having a few more beers.[T+2h]We all insufflate another dose (my third one), approximately the same dosage, probably.[T+2h:30m]I'm starting to go around the room and do stupid stuff with the things lying around, I'm starting to feel the power. Retrospectively I think I was only feeling the full effect of the second dose at this point.[T+3h (now time is getting very distorted)]I feel adventurous, I take a fourth dose (probably around 15mg, but eyeballed, so maybe more). I must precise that I'm not making the doses, a more sober friend makes them. At this point we're only two people left, just chilling listening to calm electronic/tribal music.[T+3h:30m]I'm happy with myself, I've got a good full on methoxetamine high. I don't feel the sting when I pinch the back of my hand, this makes me laugh. I'm saying I'll stay there, not go to work and enjoy the full night as a mighty being. My friends' roommates (a guy and a girl) come back from buying weed, we have a little talk.[T+3h:45m]A joint is rolled by someone. I desperately want to smoke on it. My friend tells me it is not wise, I say it can't hurt and insist (he caves, he's high too). I take three good puffs in a row on the joint. The joint is strong. It feels so nice because the MXE cancels any uncomfortable throat feelings.[T+4h]I'm feeling dissociation at an advanced stage, I feel like I'm not making any decision myself. I notice that my friends' roommates smell nice (they like quality perfume), so I start smelling their necks one after another, this goes on for a while.[T+4h:15m (takeoff)]I'm already very far gone, all of a sudden I experience a rush similar to that of MDMA kicking in. I go out on the balcony (9th floor, incredible view), I feel like the view is pouring into my eyes and I'm falling into the view at the same time. My friend comes to see if I'm alright, I hug him and at this point I notice that I'm looking at myself hugging him. I'm literally floating besides me. I go back inside, I hug everyone and say nonsense.Then I become very scared, my heart is racing like crazy and I'm cold and I feel like I'm falling down endlessly. I need to get out, I rush out. My friend follows me with only one shoe on. I'm scared of the elevator, I take the stairs.In subjective time walking down the 9 floors feels like hours. My friend tells me I kept bouncing off the walls so it might actually have taken some time to reach street level. We walk a bit around the block. I have almost no recollection of this part of the trip. I remember seeing myself from above and behind, exactly as you see Lara Croft in Tomb Raider.I sometimes regain consciousness, only to be pulled away moments after. Each time I feel like I'm going to heaven. I feel like my life is pulled outside of me by a very strong hand, I'm free of all fears, I'm a pure spirit, I feel at peace, similar to when a loud  and annoying noise suddenly stops.Have you ever realized that when you think, the thoughts seem to be localized in the area around your head? Not anymore, I don't feel my thoughts, I'm everywhere, I'm in the fabric of space and time, I've rarely been so happy.[T+4h:45]I still have flashes of dissociation rushs, but I'm mostly myself now. I go back home, I have a deep and mostly untormented sleep. I'm fine. One nice rainy fucking day I was on my way to a graduation party with every single person I had ever known since forever. I rode with my buds Andrew, Jordan & Kingsley. All I wanted to do was get wigged out and didn't feel like doing any meth or just get drunk; I purchased 2 drops of a vial containing 25i-NBOME. To my surprise he dropped 6-7 drops on my tongue. It went down my throat and almost made me want to cough. It tasted like the drip of Meth to me honestly to my recollection, but stronger and dopey-er. I didn't complain nor worry about having a bad trip, my state of mind was still very concentrated and stoned. I had been through worse I thought. Going to a graduation party of a high school I never went to...can't be as shitty as that Acid trip down at Fitzgerald's being stuck in a whirlpool of cascading staircases and screaming sadistic gutter punks. So we get to this party and it hasn't even started, they are still setting shit up. Hanging up Christmas lights and shit anywhere I would stand or sit. I wound up sitting under a gazebo with Andrew who would also DJ and hand out 25b to everybody that night I figure. This is were we would stay for the most of the party. The trip's headspace can be described in one word, Confusing. It was the most Fucked up, retarded, goofy ass fucking substance I've ever put in my mouth. I have no idea how much I had taken but it was purely visual and controllable as far as chilling goes I guess, but my mind would go numb and I would just fall right off the edge of sanity, I know I did. I couldn't speak a normal sentence for too long because I would see something off in the distance and lose all memory of what I was doing before. It wouldn't have been so bad if it wasn't so confusing, seriously the imagery was so beautiful I couldn't concentrate on anything but the visuals and how I felt. This shit took literally 20 minutes to kick in and time was spiraling out of control. I felt I was seeing everything from the perspective I should always be seeing through, I felt like I was going to be the life of the party that night or something and that I was just an amorphous blob sitting in the chair rotting away with no words left to speak, only going on this confusion I rode this out.  The visuals were intensely bright and beautiful to say the least. My vision was so sharp I had to blink as fast as possible to wipe my eyes off. I looked over and saw Andrew breaking down some Ice, he took his knife and snorted several small lines and asked if I would like to snort ice with him right now. I rejected his offer, first time I had ever said no to Meth since I went could turkey a few months back. By now I haven't realized there is a crazy party going on here, there are now 10,000 people in the orcish fortress I thought we refuged in. I was getting delirious and realized people had been passing me blunts, bottles, and beers. I was laying in a mud puddle now, I could hear loud rap music blistering my eardrums. I recalled lyrics saying 'its a motherfucking assquake?' All I could see were butts everywhere so I rolled over in my mud puddle writhing in defeat and my own self hatred. I looked up and saw a line of women dancing and they were very sexual. A bandito was at the end of them shooting his double barrel shotgun into the air looking at me. This to me, was him going 'yeah motherfucker I'm fucking your women maaaan'. I was now completely coherent as I thought of butchering this guy, my eyes were rolling all around and I was forcefully making different faces the whole time. My friend Kingsley now interrupted my thought process as all attention came to the DJ booth.Kingsley jumped up on the table, the music went off, people are laughing at me in my puddle. Kingsley armed with a empty bottle of jack and microphone on hand screaming 'YOU GUYS PRETTY FUCKED UP!' *insert drunk adolescents laughing here* The irony was baffling. Now he says and does, with a strange motion 'ANDREW IF YOU GOT MY PIPE I'M GONNA KICK YOUR ASS' as he pointed at Andrew's face knocking over all the speakers and bottles on the table. Andrew just gave it back to him with no trouble it wasn't worth fucking everything up. By now the party went to shit, Some black kids were starting fights across the backyard, cops were hitting the scene as usual so I walked back to the car with Andrew and Robert. Jordan came to but he was tripping, he told us he was going to have to run home, break into his own house and steal the other key to his mom's car because he decided to hide his keys somewhere in the backyard aside just conveniently wearing them on a chain or putting it in your fucking pocket just so he can get Andrew's supplies out of the trunk. I now found out Robert had to play babysitter with his dumbass friend Chase who was laying in the back on his truck, He had apparently puked on some young girls boobies and shit himself. This was visually accurate as I could clearly see a drunk teen that was unconscious in the grass of a neighbors yard.I went and pissed in their yard then smoked a blunt with Robert as I watched him talk to Chase as if he was a pissed off step-mother. He exclaimed 'Chase, Hey Chase? Do you know where you are?'. Chase goes 'Urrrghghrrh'. Now it switches back and forth to Robert. 'DO YOU KNOW WHERE YOU ARE?' I pace back and forth trying to keep the spiders and brown recluses from crawling on Andrew's face as he sleeps on the sidewalk of somebody else's house. Chase eventually says 'We are at your house', I have long sense forgotten what Robert had said to him after.Overall the night was long and I can't go on much longer, I've been eating mushrooms all night so sorry about the bad literature or whatever term being. But neigh in a nutshell I find 25i to be fun and stimulating at low-high doses and very psychedelic but as far as heroic doses go I was on a ++++++whatever. This stuff was assured to be 25i as well it was purchased just not by me. I had previously tried the same drops a few days prior and I tripped pretty damn hard off 1 & 2 hits. But 6? Was a waste, too much confusion to gain anything from it IMO but the trip wasn't bad. If you're looking for a deeper more LSD-like experience from the NBOME series (if this is all you can gain access too) I suggest 25B, not 25I as it's deeper spiritually and carries more hallucinatory aspects instead of the casual phenethylamine feeling of being wired or goofed up. 25I has also caused death, sorry again about my poor grammar.Stay cool guys. I started the night off at my girlfriends house where I drank one can of Thatchers Gold. I already had 1.5 tabs of acid and 0.5g of MDMA, ready to take when we were heading out. Before we left I took 0.125g of MDMA orally.We arrived at the venue at around 11:00pm, and I took the tab and a half of acid whilst we were in the queue. Once we got inside I bought a bottle of water. After half an hour or so, the MDMA and the LSD began to hit me at roughly the same time. I felt wonderful (as one could imagine) and was enjoying dancing and my trip was getting greater and greater. About half an hour later I bumped into my friend and he had this nasal spray in a bottle. My girlfriend didn't do it, but I sprayed once into my nose. I didn't know it was 25I-NBMOe, this was the first time I had done a drug without researching it extensively.The effects from it were almost instant and for the first half an hour the euphoria was incredible. The visuals were beautiful and dancing felt effortless. The lasers looked amazing and things seemed to be teleporting and twitching around. It was like looking through a kaleidoscope. There were trails from everything, like everyone was moving around so fast that I could see them behind them. I began to feel wobbly and was stumbling around slightly. It felt like the best experience ever and I told my girlfriend that she should try it.My girlfriend suggested that we go outside so I followed her outside, tripping and stumbling and bumping into door frames, which seemed funny at the time. 1:00 AM: We found a different, female friend who had also taken the same thing and she was also equally messed up from it. It was then that I quite literally couldn't see anything but blurry faces nearby due to the colours and patterns in my vision.   1:15 AM: I felt my hand start twitching, then my arms, then my head, and I managed to say to my girlfriend 'I'm twitching, I'm twi...' I was panicking, then time seemed to freeze for me. I felt stuck in this position but everything around me had also stopped. Literally like time had frozen but I was still conscious. I thought I was dead.This is what my girlfriend said happened to me: my twitches got violent and aggressive, I fell on the floor flat on my back, then I started having a seizure where my body was having full convulsions and my head was shaking really violently. I somehow got my head under a bench, but two men grabbed hold of my head to keep my head safe. I started choking. She was on Acid so she could see blood coming from my eyes. It lasted at least 5 minutes and then my body relaxed and I was led like a dead body on the floor. I was trying to get up, but couldn't. I was dripping with sweat and my face was bright purple.The next thing I remember was being ushered out the front door by a security guard and I sat down on a ledge out the front of the venue. I didn't want to be there and wanted to run away. I had overwhelming paranoia. I couldn't speak, every time I tried to run away I just stumbled and had to sit down again. We had a friend come pick us up and take me back to my girlfriend's house. In the car I thought there was like 15 people was confused as to how I was going to fit, but there was only 2. I then got in the car, but needed to get out. I tried to escape the car, desperately trying to climb out the door. 2:00 AM: Once we got home, my temperature was all over the place, shivering to sweating, to taking all my clothes off and sitting on the front door step.We sat there for a while and I tried to be sick out the front door but I stood up and walked into the kitchen where I was sick all over her kitchen floor. I then went upstairs, got in bed and took two Valium. Didn't fall asleep. Took two more, didn't fall asleep. I only fell asleep after 10 Valium then woke up two hours later. Once I woke up I did a line of ketamine which seemed to straighten me out and relax me a bit.It was easily the worst drug experience I have ever had. I am never doing 25I-NBOMe again. I have done LSD and MDMA together numerous times and never had a problem. I later spoke to the man that gave me the spray and he said that it doesn't mix well with anti depressants (the citalopram) so maybe that was part of the cause of it.Thanks for reading and stay away from 25I-NBOMe. Not only was it the scariest experience of my life but it was for my girlfriend as well. Apparently seizures from this drug can cause death, so if you do try it, be extremely careful with dosage. I am currently in the middle of a nine day trip to Utah in which my friend 'D' and I (both experienced skiers) plan to master the mountains by day and empty both of our drug collections by the time the vacation is over. I am writing this on the evening of the fourth day of my trip while still residually feeling the effects of the substances taken earlier today. I want to commit the events of the previous to writing before they begin to fade from memory. Day 1: Codeine and CannabisAfter 7 hours of strenuous skiing on our first day in Utah, D and I decided it was time to break into our mutual collection of psychoactive substances. I wanted to mellow out after our day of exercise and I thought that codeine and weed would be a good combination to kick off the vacation. I used cold-water extraction on 8 pills (325-8) for a rough total of around 55 mg of codeine in solution. I'm estimating a loss of around 10-15% due to imperfect execution of the extraction process. I drank the solution myself because 'D' had been taking clonazepam and did not want to risk the combination.The codeine kicked in around 20-25 minutes after ingestion and gave me a light and happy buzz, about what I was expecting considering my moderate opiate tolerance. D and I began packing a large, finely-ground 1g bong of the weed I had brought (a very high-quality headies strain) and proceeded to smoke it over a period of about 30 minutes. We each got more hits than we could count and were admittedly 'blazed off our asses' as D likes to say. The cannabis seemed to affect D substantially more than me and he laughed sporadically and seemingly uncontrollably in the ensuing hours. He kept talking about how he felt like 'scenes' were repeating over and over like in the movie Groundhog Day.I could feel both the codeine and the weed for hours after we smoked and altogether it was a very pleasant high. I ended up playing Gears of War II online with D after the high had settled in a little more and both he and I were amazed at how well I was able to perform in the game. Long before either the codeine or weed had began to wear off for me, D (who was still as blitzed as ever) suggested we redose with something. We settled on more THC and each ate one cookie made with 1.5 grams of midgrade weed followed by one 'THC pill' I had made before the trip. It took over an hour for the high to come on, but once it did, we were both fried for the rest of the night. Day 2: Clonazepam, Cannabis, and AlcoholAfter another long day of skiing, D and I broke into the 'goodie bag' we had packed to begin round two of the substance abuse. The poisons for the night: 4 mg clonazepam, and a ton of alcohol and weed. I took 4 mg of clonazepam and started drinking mixed drinks early in the night. After the clonazepam and alcohol began kicking in I took three THC pills (those of you who have taken THC pills before will appreciate just how large of a dose this is) and ate the last weed brownie. Then D broke out the bong and we smoked another gram of the headies I had brought. D informed me the following morning that at this point, I took another 2 mg of clonazepam. I have no recollection of the rest of the night. I awoke at 6:30 the next morning nauseated, pale, and lightheaded to find over a dozen empty bottles of high-alcohol beer around the living room as well as two of the liquor bottles drained. I have mixed feelings about this experience, but would very likely not repeat it. I gave the rest of the clonazepam to D. Day 3: Cannabis and AlcoholJust beer and weed. A good, but nevertheless unremarkable night. Day 4: Psilocybin, Dextromethrophan, and CannabisBy day four, my muscles were getting sore and I was fighting a cold, so I decided that it was a good day to break out the shrooms. Unfortunately I had only been able to obtain a single gram of dried Psilocybe cubensis from my friend before leaving. I wanted I stronger trip than 1 gram would be able to give me so, for better or for worse, I decided to combine it with DXM. I took the mushrooms and 240 mg of dextromethrophan HBR about 20 minutes after taking 160 mg of dextromethrophan polistirex. I also took 8 mg chloropheniramine to reduce itching. I followed that with a 1.5g marijuana cookie and one THC pill.I prepared a warm bath and set up a 'tripping playlist' on my MP3 player. I was starting to feel the DXM (but not the shrooms or weed) in about 45 minutes and was getting butterflies with excitement and decided to smoke a bowl of the headies to calm down. The ensuing trip was very intense. About 75 minutes after my initial dose of DXM, I started feeling very short of breath and a little light-headed. I shut off the lights, laid down in the bath, turned on the music, and drifted away. The things I saw in the next hour are difficult to put into words. At various times I felt as if I was floating through space, witnessing the magnification of fractals, riding on a train through the air, and other strange sensations. The music fueled my hallucinations, most of which were closed-eye. The most intense experience, however, was a several-minute-long open eye vision of what may have been the formation of a star. Surprisingly, I was still able to perform simple tasks such as rebooting the MP3 player when it froze, and adjusting the water temperature. I do not remember getting out of the jacuzzi, but I recall drying and dressing. I remember having a conversation with an elderly man who was certainly a figment of my imagination. The MP3 player never left my ears. Indeed, I felt as if my whole trip was fueled by the music.After getting out of the bath I have a myriad of memories of things I may or may not have done. Some are realistic like pouring myself a bowl of cereal, while others are more fantastic things such as jumping off of buildings or walking through walls. Some of the memories seem vivid, others more hazy, but I am astonished by the sheer quantity of them. I feel like I must have lived through a whole lifetime of memories in the five or six hours I was tripping. At times the trip would become so intense that I would be confined to the bed or couch for periods of what seemed like several hours, although in retrospect they could not have lasted that long. During these periods, I felt ecstatic pleasure coursing through my legs and arms. I found myself forgetting to breathe until my lungs hurt and then remember gasping for breath which was in itself also a highly pleasurable experience. At times I felt as if I was not a solid being at all, and had several instances of what would be called an 'out of body' experiences in which I felt no physical connection to myself at all.Even now, over eight hours after taking the DXM, shrooms, and weed, I still feel in a daze and am having periodic flashbacks of the things I saw/remember. I am also still experiencing brief, diluted flashbacks of the physical ecstasy I felt while convulsing, overwhelmed by the power of the trip. I am in awe at how intense the DXM-Psilocybin-THC combination was. The trip was something I would have thought reserved for DMT or 2C-B or the like. I am not planning on repeating the experience on this ski trip, although I am not ruling it out for some point in the future. One other note: I smoked a large bong with D that night and did not get high at all. I can think of no satisfactory physiological explanation for this, but given the events of the day I am inclined to believe that psychologically the weed high was ineffectual after the combination high in the preceding hours.I am writing the record of days 5 - after the conclusion of our trip. During this time, I went through my entire supply of hydrocodone and oxycodone as well as the remaining THC pills, cookies, and innumerable bongs with my friend D. As such, while I still do remember the dosages I was taking quite clearly, it is difficult to recall the exact order of events and the time at which the various drugs were taken.Day 5: Hydrocodone, Cannabis, and AlcoholChristmas Day: time to break out the stronger opiates. D and I skied early in the day and returned to the house at around 1:00. I started off the drugs with 17.5 mg of hydrocodone from a very well executed cold-water extraction, then started drinking mixed drinks with grapefruit juice to inhibit my body’s metabolism of the Vicodin. D and I took two THC pills each half an hour later and continued drinking (from a supply of Aventinus, Troix Pistoles, and Rochefort 10, three of our favorite beers). Once I started feeling the hydrocodone (but before the THC pills had taken effect) D and I smoked a bid bong of the headies and lay down to listen to some music. The full effect of the large intake of weed came on shortly after and the resulting body buzz in combination with the hydrocodone was wonderful. I was very much enjoying listening to the music, but I started to become light sensitive again (although not nearly as much as I had the day before) so I closed the blinds and continued listening to music. D left to shower and I grabbed a few more beers. By the time D finished his shower, I was rather intoxicated and was having a very enjoyable time lying on the couch in low-light listening to music. D and I played another couple games of Gears 2 (and were again both surprised at how well we were able to perform given our substantial inebriation).By the time we finished playing it had been almost four hours since I had taken the initial dose of hydrocodone and I was still feeling the drug combination strongly. Despite this, I desired more, so took the remaining 12.5 mg of hydrocodone from the extraction, along with grapefruit juice and 35mg diphenhydramine (to strengthen the effect and increase the duration of the hydrocodone), 8mg chlorapheniromine (to reduce the itching), 75mg pseudoephedrine (so I wouldn’t’t crash), and another THC pill. I began feeling the effect of the hydrocodone in only about 20 minutes, and the THC pill in (I think) about 30 minutes after that, by which time I was in opiate-induced ecstasy. The body high was amazing, especially once the third pill kicked in. The physical euphoria began to feel almost sexual after a while, although mentally I had no desire to do anything other than lie down and listen to more music. This was the strongest body high I had experienced up to this point, only to be eclipsed by the hydrocodone and oxycodone combination from the next day.Day 6: Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, Cannabis, and AlcoholAfter over 7 hours of skiing D and I were both tired and drinking a few beers and ripping a bong as soon as we got back did little to improve the situation. I took another 17.5 mg of extracted hydrocodone and D (who had a substantially lower tolerance than me) took the remaining 12.5 at around 6:00.  We kept drinking through out the evening, and I think D took another THC pill. At around 9, I decided to be an idiot and blow 5mg of oxycodone and rip another bong (this tine by myself). The high was remarkably similar to that of the previous night, but I was only able to enjoy it for an hour or so before I passed out. I’m still kicking myself for wasting the combination when I should have known that I would have not been able to stay awake.Day 7: Clonazepam, Dextromethrophan, Cannabis, AlcoholAnother day of skiing. After getting back to the house D and I each took 2 mg of clonazepam, smoked a bong, and killed a couple beers before going out to dinner at a five-star restaurant. I was able to maintain my sobriety better than he was so I took care of the ordering processes among other things for us. The dinner was frankly hilarious and we both had a great time. When we got back, I desired a different combination than the cannabis-opiate-alcohol trio I had been playing with for the past few days. We still had a ton of acid-base extracted dextromethrophan HBr, so I took 180 mg in an effort to create a solid 1st plateau DXM dose. I had half a dozen beers while watching some Its Always Sunny then bonged 1g of headies w/ D and another .5g by myself afterwards. The resulting high was fantastic. I was mentally functional and fairly clear-headed, but I felt very euphoric and kept up a somewhat ridiculous mental conversation with myself that was actually quite intellectually stimulating, or at least seemed to be at the time. The body buzz during this period was also nice. Altogether I enjoyed the combination tremendously, and was eager to try it out again in a few days.Day 8: Hydrocodone, Cannabis, and ClonazepamBy this point I still had a substantial supply of hydrocodone, so I took another 17.5 mg but this time was too lazy to bother with the extraction. With the fact that I had 1.75 grams of acetaminophen in my liver in mind, I decided to forgo the alcohol for the night, and instead decided to finish off the last three THC pills as well as the last weed cookie. While I do have a fairly high marijuana tolerance, I was unable to maintain any semblance of sobriety once the 3+ grams of weed I had ingested took effect. I melted into the couch and watched South Park and Its Always Sunny for about four hours. The body buzz was quite pleasant however. Once the hydrocodone started wearing off I began to toy with the idea of taking a few mg of clonazepam and smoking another bong. D, who was piss drunk on top of the clonazepam he had taken earlier in the day, persuaded me that it would be a good idea, and so we each took 2mg of clonazepam and smoked a large bong.By the time we were done, it was past 9:00 and we were both getting a little tired. We decided to hit up the hot tub with some girls who were staying in a house near ours. They had both been drinking heavily and one of them had taken D up on an offer of some clonazepam. I began to feel very tired after only half an hour in the hot tub, so I decided to call it a night and let D have some time alone with one of the girls. I got into bed around 10:30 and passed out shortly after.Day 9: Dextromethrophan, Alcohol, Cannabis, Codeine, OxycodoneThis was the last day of our trip and D and I both agreed that it called for a celebration. Around 1:00, after a half day of skiing, D took the last 15 mg of hydrocodone and began drinking a fifth of Malibu straight from the bottle. I wanted to re-experience the excellent tri-buzz from two days prior, so I took 140 mg of dextromethrophan polistirex and 120 mg of dextromethrophan HBr in an effort to produce a second-plateau effect and started drinking some of the nice beers we had in the fridge. About a half-hour after taking the DXM, I packed up a huge bong of some of the best weed D and I had seen. The bong ripped forever and we each got a ton of good hits. Although we were both very high at this point, we still had about a gram of ISO hash I had made the day before that we both wanted to smoke, so I packed up another bong of all the hash I had left. This bong yielded only 4 hits, but with each one I could feel my body tingling and starting to feel abnormally light. By the time we were done, D was borderline tripping out. He could not make sense of anything around him and kept thinking that I was someone else. I persuaded him to go downstairs to watch a movie and I grabbed the rest of the Aventinus for us to drink. I was ridiculously high, and frankly I’m not even sure how I was able to manage these tasks, but somehow we managed to get the movie going and started drinking. This may have been the strongest mental “high” I have felt, and although it could not compare to the intense euphoria of the opiate combinations, I still was feeling amazingly good.I had trouble following the movie, and after a while decided to close my eyes and relax on the couch. I began to have mild closed-eye visuals, but nothing compared to the all-out trip of day four. Once the movie ended, D was passed out, but I still wanted more. Around 4:30, I took 70 mg of extracted codeine and waited for it to kick in while listening to some good music. As soon as I started feeling the opiate buzz, I realized my mistake: I had forgotten to take an antihistamine. Sure enough, the itching began a few minutes later, but fortunately only lasted about 30 minutes before the clorapheriramine kicked in. At this point, the DXM and some of the alcohol were wearing off, but my overall buzz was still very strong and very pleasant. Even so, I had 10 mg of oxycodone remaining, so around 6:00, I decided to go for it. I took 7.5 mg of oxycodone orally with some grapefruit juice to enhance the opiate duration and blew the remaining 2.5 mg shortly after. I then smoked a small bowl, and took 75 mg of pseudoephedrine so I could stay up to enjoy the experience. And what an experience it was. I was in a state of utter ecstasy for hours, and have no negative aspects of the experience (aside from a little itching) to report.And so concludes the greatest vacation I have ever had. In those nine days, I experienced some of the best skiing of my life, and by night, more substance-induced ecstasy than I had ever come close to experiencing before. Pre-Experience: MDMA/Ecstasy 3 times. LSD 2 times. Alchohol, drunk like 5 times (I don't really enjoy it very much), weed smoked quite a bit, but recently quit for a month or two.Setting: This whole experience happened at a rave at a camp site, which lasted at total of 4 days (music was on for 3).Day 1 (no music yet)My friend had asked me to go to this rave festival with him. I was a little skeptical about it being my first rave ever. So I thought on it and decided to go with him.The night we arrived it was a little sketchy at first but funny in the same sense. I was greeted by my 'Mom and Dad', my 'mom' with a big hug as soon we pulled into the camp site and she blasted 'I'm your mom for the weekend and Mic is your dad!' Mom was very drunk by this point (I was under-age and I needed somebody over 18 to ensure I'd be okay) and she soon says, I can do drugs but I just have to be safe about it (water, rest, food etc). She guided my friend to his parking spot for the weekend which was hilarious, she was yelling and bossing C (my friend) to basically have the perfect park job!Then Mic ('dad') came to the site of my passenger door where I was sitting. He shook my hand for like 10-20 seconds, which seemed like a very long handshake. He had been trying to intimidate me for fun I believe. I was a little sketched out but in the end he was one of the nicest people I've ever met.That night I met everybody. I'm a rather shy person so I didn't say much to them. My friend and I tried to set up the tent ASAP because night was starting to fall and I needed a place to sleep. After struggling and failing for about an hour, night finally fell and we decided to just give up and that I would sleep in the van for the night. I just marinated at the epic camp site for the rest of the night. The campers had set up basically the greatest decorations in all of the festival. So colorful and beautiful and just down right perfect!Chilling on the lawn chairs with a bunch of my fellow campers who I soon became acquainted with. They seemed like the chillest down to earth people I'd ever met. My friend soon went to go to bed in the van while I stayed out and talked with my friends. My new friend R, packed a hookah and told me to start smoking, so I did. Later we eventually put hash into the bowl and it was great! I was sitting beside this girl (who goes by the name of Dragon) who asked her, I think what was her boyfriend, 'is your world looking straight and narrow?' he replies with 'no'. Dragon replies with 'not a good answer'. So she pulls out this white powder with a little spoon like thing and takes out a little powder on it and holds it out for her BF to snort. At this point I was like 'wtf is going on here?!' in my head. Somebody soon asks what was it and she replies 'ketamine'. I'd never even heard of it before so I asked asked and it sounded intense. One of the DJs had been camping with us (I didn't realize til he was on stage) and he was asking for drugs from anybody. Dragon pulls out the ketamine and the DJ asks if he can have some. She pulls out a hit for him and he smells it like a flower. He soon replies still snorting with his nose 'What was that by the way?' I thought that it was crazy and hardcore that he didn't even know what he had done til after. I soon went to bed after.Day 2 (Music festival starting up)First thing in the morning my friend and I finally set up the tent. I had brought two hits of acid and planned on doing one of them later in the day and my friend C would do one as well. We went to where they were setting up stages and just sat in the shade for a long time. My friend was trying to make me take my acid early (it was 2PM) and I wanted to do it at about 5 or 6 so I would be able to be awake all night no problem. After arguing for about 30 - 60 minutes about when to take it I told him I took it at about 2:30 (I didn't take it yet). He said he would take it an hour and a half after I did. We walked back to camp, I was pretending to be feeling it a little. Then eventually headed back to the music.On the way to the music we smoked a bowl of weed and that's when I snuck the LSD into my mouth (about 3:30 pm? I had no track of time this whole thing so I'm guessing). He then took his about 30 minutes later. We walked down to the little pond thing and crossed the bridge. We were reunited with some of our fellow campers and a bunch of others. I told them I was on acid and they were all like nice, we have to get some for ourselves too. This is where I started to trip balls.I had packed about 2 more bowls and passed it around. I felt a shift in atmosphere but I couldn't put my finger on what exactly was changing. Eventually we left the people I didn't really know and it was the campers and I. We moved closer to the music and some went back to camp to look for LSD. They all came back saying they took their acid and we just marinated on the grass by the main stage, staring at things, intrigued with how everything looked more beautiful and how everything had been starting to melt. It was eventually just a girl and I together somehow and we just lay by each other, discussing everything we see and what's happening in each others minds. This seemed to be one of the most epic things and I felt really connected to this girl. We laid and stared at trees. Things had seemed to be blooming. Trees would grow outwards and then blossom with flowers on the tips, and then those flowers would slowly blossom towards me!We eventually went and sat on the the other side of the pond thing where we were pretty much secluded from everybody but could still see everything. We still lay and sit there chatting about the usual.Soon later, my friend K, had run up to us with a water gun and two kids about 7 years old who both had water guns. They started chasing us and shooting us with water guns. This was a little irritating considering I was not in the mind set to deal with kids. But it took a quick turn around. It soon felt like I was a kid again, it was exactly like playing tag when I was in elementary school! Being chased around by the 3 people was one of the most coolest experiences to happen at the festival.P (the girl I felt connected with), C, and I started to book it back to the campsite which had to be about 3 or 4 football fields away. The kids were still chasing us!! And they managed to keep up some how. I was outstanded, thrilled and a little scared too. These kids were on a mission and it was to get us wet!The kids caught up to us and finally used up all their water after about an hour! It was a terrific accomplishment finally being able to sit and just enjoy.By now I was just starting to peak and I had been tripping out so hard! I sat by my new friend R, who was giving me advice on how to take an acid trip. While he was explaining I remember just looking up at the trees, and things changed color and texture for a brief about 5 seconds. In this little while I had forgotten who I was.  R is one of the smartest people I know and have met! He has the best advice anybody has ever given me. It's unbelievable!I had experienced a bad trip before, and I told him I experienced an 'ego death' which he later told me was 'Ego Freedom'. He was saying stuff like, if you start to have a bad trip just remember, that its like sitting in a canoe going down a river. All you need to do is tell yourself that and you'll be fine. What ever you see going down that river will eventually be behind you and don't let one bad idea spiral into a nightmare. He also said that LSD is a big head game with yourself, sure you can be with other friends but when it comes down to it, its just you, within your mind! I was so stoked on how smart R was and how great of a friend I made him this festival!He eventually went to the stage where I just laid on the blanket outside on our site and just tripped out for awhile. Trees and other nature were still blooming and blossoming before my eyes. As well the world had began to feel like I was a cartoon living in a cartoon world. Nothing looked, or seemed real in the slightest. My reality was shattered. Later heading back to the music where I met up with P again. Night had fallen I believe. It's hard to remember everything - I was tripping balls. Then I seemed to lose everybody but P, so we were together the entire night.We started to dance and I was loving it. She soon says she doesn't want to dance so I said we can go for a walk and chill. The both of us walked and went on an adventure on a random path.I held her hand on the way there. She looks at me and says 'what're you doing?' (Something like that, I'm unsure.) I apologize instantly and realize she doesn't want anything. While walking she eventually grabs my hand about 10 minutes later. I was surprised and didn't know what to think.Ends up we walked around the whole camp site and ended back up at the main desk/pond. We found a really nice spot to lay down and look at the stars and the ravers in the distance. She tells me how it's weird, she said she's usually one of the ravers just going to the music.P and I still relaxing on the grass. Enjoying the music and the comfort of each other, gazing into the stars. We realize dark clouds are slowly drifting on top of us. I suggest that a storm may be coming possibly.Everything had become very calm, cool and still. It was the calm before the storm. The storm seemed like a hurricane on the prairies! I've never seen so much rain fall in my life. P and I decided to go sit under a tree thinking we could wait out the storm, but it just got worse and worse. The storm was raining through all the trees and we were getting soaked! We decided to go up the stairs by the main office where it was dry. While on the way up to the stairs we found L, a friend/camper! He had done acid for his first time and was also very drunk, he was hysterical! Upon walking up the stairs, which had literally looked like a water fall now, flowing like niagra falls.At the top, soaked. L says 'so is the party over' I couldn't hold back but to laugh! He was standing in the rain, in a puddle, under a gutter!! He could not have gotten anymore wet, he was using the gutter as if it were a shower and was dancing in the puddle.The storm had eventually passed and we went to go check the aftermath of the storm. The main stage had been demolished. I was super bummed! It was such a dope stage! We eventually went back to the spot where we had been sitting. And there was an enormous tree branch that had fallen as well as many other small ones! Just about 2 meters away, that is crazy!P and I go to sit on the big stair by the pond and star gaze again. We see a star that looks significantly different from all the rest. Both of us begin talking, suggesting that its a UFO, P starts to cry out of joy and confusion and amazement. I feel incredibly connected to her. We were both in the same mind set, thinking we were seeing one of the wonders of the world. After about an hour or 2 of watching this star. We finally come to the realization that its a planet and it looks so different because its reflecting the sun!Feeling kind of tired, I tell P and she says she has MDMA we could have. I thought that it was a great idea so we headed back to camp. The stage was working now, but there was no visuals at the time. We grab a bunch of MDMA. 3 of us snort some of it (my first time snorting it). K also snorted some (friend/camper). We had also grabbed some alcohol to drink.Finally arriving at the main stage, about an hour or two from sunrise, we begin to dance. I see a lot of familiar faces on the dance floor. Such as R! He had a 7 foot stick with an inflatable heart at the top of it. This looked so fucking epic and awesome! I loved it.I had entered a trance where there was no way I could stop dancing! Soon doing more MDMA. My memory is a little foggy after this. But I remember I danced till sunrise. 4 others and I headed back to camp to grab a blanket and go to the pond to watch the sun rise. Quickly coming to the realization that we are all tired and want to sleep. We went back to home (camp) and slept.Day 3Not too much happened during the day. I talked with everybody about last evening. There was now an awkwardness between P and I for some unknown reason which remained the rest of the festival.Also I took R's heart he had on his stick and held it to me, later suggesting that it would be cool to tape it to my chest! Which we instantly did, I felt like I belonged there now. The heart symbolizing connection between everyone which is how I felt the festival was!That day I talked about shrooms to everyone and was unsure if I should try them as I had not done the before. I asked R for advice and he said I should try them. So I went and got 1 gram of Chocolate covered mushrooms.By this point I was shit-faced! Shortly after, I ate the mush. It put the entire thing in my mouth. It was way too much to handle in one bite, but I managed to chew it down anyway. It was a thick dry milk chocolate and you could taste the mushrooms very slightly, it was although it was eating chocolate with nuts in it.We headed to the dance floor. I was feeling a slight shift in my reality. Once again, I couldn't put my finger on what it was! We walked as a big group down. I was walking beside R. I was chatting with him saying how he's so smart and gives the best advice! I asked if I could call him my shaman, as that is how I felt about him, anything I wondered or needed to know, he knew! Even when I didn't ask. He replied with yes and I was super stoked!On arrival I drink a bit of my alcohol that I brought with me to the dance. I was definitely still wasted and now tripping a little bit from shrooms. After losing almost everybody except C I was bummed out and decided to sit by the pond. I felt like passing out; I was not having a good time. I pretty much sat around for an hour or two alone until the alchohol wore off so I actually felt amazing after! Colors simply looked out of this world. It was like I had been color blind and I was seeing colors for the first time ever, colors were simply beautiful! I also has a huge body stone, which felt a bit like MDMA but my body felt more numb. I was still once again looking for others! I could not find ANYBODY! I did not know what to do and I was panicking a bit. But soon came to the realization that I can always meet new friends and just enjoy life! They had also redone the stage and it was as good as new! The stage once again looked phenomenal!This concept was a bit difficult for me usually as I am a shy person, but when I was on mushrooms, drunk, and high from weed. It came as though it was a natural gift I soon possessed. I went to the very front of the speakers and started to dance. I had practiced shuffling before, but once again! It just came naturally now.I was having the best time of my life! I had become the music. I felt as though everybody was my family and that we were all at harmony! I danced for a couple hours till I finally found some people I knew from camp.I had not had water the whole time and I was soaking wet with sweat! I saw R and one of the first words that came out of my mouth was, water! He reacted as fast as he could to get my water. I was amazed at this simple but yet amazing gesture! I soon told him what was happening and he said we should go sit down and relax as I had been over heating. We had very intellectual conversations. He was telling me how he used to have a drug problem and how he is as a person.He said he's terrific at helping others out with their problems but when it comes to his own, sometimes he struggles deeply. I was shocked as he was one of the smartest and nicest people I've ever met. He told me that J had been his shaman, like he was to me (a girl who we were camping with). He was trying to say I understand what you're going through and I'm there for you bro. R eventually says that kids usually fuck up with drugs, but I can handle it really well and that he wants to go into big brothers big sisters. I felt incredible for him and I encouraged him to do it! Even I wish I could have him for a big bro. He wants to show kids that fuck up with drugs that you don't need to take 9 pills to have a good time or 12 grams of shrooms. It just takes a little. After out heart to heart talk, he had the brilliant idea that we should put the inflatable heart on my back and not my chest because it gets in the way of dancing , especially dancing with girls.Soon after doing so I started dancing again. I asked him for tips on trying to find a girl there as I couldn't find one I was attracted to! Once again, it came as no surprise, he gave the greatest advice ever!R told me to just go find a spot where I was comfortable, close my eyes and just let the music do its part, just lose myself within the music. And when I open my eyes, I'd lock eyes with a girl and everything would be great. Oddly enough, I did exactly as he said, and guess what!? I locked eyes with a girl and we soon began dancing with each other! She was one of the cutest girls at the whole thing, a little raver girl wearing a mini skirt, furry boots, bikini top, and a cat hat that looked really sexy! I was shocked at how good of advice R gives, like, it's insane! I was feeling euphoric for probably one of the first times ever. It felt like absolutely everybody was my best friend and that there was no ice to break. This was a little odd to me because I'm a shy timid person around new people, especially adults. It was the greatest feeling I've ever felt! I cannot even explain how terrific this felt. Just feeling the love of everybody, at complete unity and peace with one another as human beings! I'd smile at somebody, they'd smile back. I was shuffling and almost instantly I found other shufflers around me, shuffling with me! It was incredible and unreal. I almost could not believe this was happening. I was shuffling in sync with others and we would take turns, I truly discovered what it was like to lose your ego at this point. I didn't care what anybody looked like but only the connection we shared. It legitimately felt like everybody was at one huge family at a reunion!After dancing the night away, most of the crowd had disappeared into the fog of the night. I told J (the girl I had been dancing with) that I was tired. She instantly concurred with me and I asked if we should head back. We started to head back and I asked what she did tonight. She had done acid and smoked weed which was cool and would have been a blast as well.We got to my tent where we went in to the tent and there was no way we were going to sleep. After dancing with her all night, I felt connect and incredibly attracted to her, there was no holding back. I soon found us having sex! The sex was incredible. It's inevitable to explain how great everything was. I didn't have a single worry in the world and I could not be happier!Day 4 (final day of music)Later that morning I saw J leave but I was still asleep. I woke up later that morning thinking to myself I'd never see her again and I was kind of bummed as she was from the same city I was and I thought we could have been friends.I had bought more shrooms for the night today and I still had an entire vial of MDMA. Not too much happened during the day so I'm going to skip to night.That night I took the mushrooms and took about an eighth of the MDMA which isn't a lot but it seemed to do wonders! I'd like to start off by saying I have never been higher in my life.I took the mushrooms and right after parachuted the MDMA. I didn't really know what to expect as this was the first time I had ever 'hippie flipped'. I started to feel a shift in reality as usual. I had arrived to the dance floor and everything began to look amazing. The lights looked mesmerizing. The bass from the music became my heartbeat. My body was feeling numb but at peace. I had the giggles like I want a young baby and I felt butterfly like feelings inside my stomach which in turn made me smile and I couldn't stop! Things started to look like they were from a 3D pop out book. I remember I walked by this tree a ton and it just looked more and more different every time. It just seemed to POP out at me! This had been the greatest I have felt in my entire life! I don't remember a point in the night where I was not smiling. I was the happiest person in the world!Dancing for an hour or so. I began to wonder if I would see J again that night. I asked R what I should do and he said something like 'Don't fuck a different chick man, make her your temple'. As he had never given me bad advice, I had no choice but to listen! He had also told me to go up behind her and smack her ass and say 'damn I had a good time last night' and walk away. It would've been hilarious to do that, but it was too vulgar for me.After a quick water break with R, my eyes finally spotted J on the other site of the rave. The colors still looking magnificent and everything seeming surreal, I strutted my way across to J not knowing what to expect. I came up behind her and was greeted instantly with a huge grin, with a big bear hug. I was stoked that things were going really well!My 'parents' had soon come to us and they stole J from me like a bunch of ninjas. They only took her a couple meters away, but I could hear what they were saying. They told her they were my parents and she had the most confused look on her face I've ever seen! She was absolutely clueless. While D (a guy from another camp, who had tried acid for the first time) had given me an enormous hug and said 'man, I fucking love you!' This was fucking great! Euphoria is really indescribable but this is one of the closest examples that had happened there! That night he had been going up to everybody he knew and did the exact same thing to them, he had even tried to kiss 'dad'! Anyways. I was reunited with J after having a big group photo, which seemed like a family portrait! I haltingly explained that they weren't my parents and that they were just saying that because they assumed responsibility over me. She kind of understood but I re-explained it to her later.We continued to dance like our lives depended on it. I literally had people from my camp running up to me to give me water and gum. I loved how they were so concerned for me, it made me feel like the greatest person in the world.A little while after, J asks me if I want to smoke a bowl. I yelled 'sure!' On the way out of the dance area, I saw R, and I have him an epic high five. It was so epic it seemed like it had created a shock wave. We went to the big open field where lazers and trippy images on the screens were. We smoked and I offered J and her friend some MDMA because I had more than plenty. Her friend said no because she had to drive tomorrow. I loaded the MDMA onto a Kleenex for J. We had still been passing the pipe around smoking like chimneys. I was incredibly high. The music was incredibly different and sounded like it was the best thing my ears have ever listened to. As well as colours just looked a lot more vibrant and incredible! She took the MDMA and said 'thanks for the MDMA'. We then sat there for about 20 minutes. During this time, we had begun cuddling in the middle of the field, soon leading to us kissing, and then making out. Soon enough we were going all out. I had even started to touch in inappropriate places, she then said something which I'm unclear of but all I know is she wanted me to stop.We soon went back to the music and dancing again. Still feeling incredibly euphoric and all the effects as before, if not even stronger than before. I felt really connected to this girl, as if she was my girlfriend. After dancing for about 30 minutes or so. We went back to sit down.Sitting for a little bit I turned to J as we were cuddling and said 'I'm tired' because I started to get tired and my legs were KILLING me as I had been dancing for hours and hours every day. She replied saying 'me too'. I then raised the question 'do you want to head back?' and she said 'sure'. It was still dark out and I'm thinking this was about 4 am in the morning. We arrived at my tent which was about a ten minute walk and both went in comfortably. This is the latest I had arrived to my tent all weekend and I was kind of excited to go to sleep early. Little did I know, I soon found us having sex. It was the best sex I have ever had in my life. I could definitely still feel the effects of the drugs. I could literally feel the bass from my tent, which gives you an idea of how loud the music really was. Touching felt AMAZING and sex, well, I can't begin to explain how great it felt!! It was ten times better than usual! After going at it for awhile and getting comfortable. I realized that it is very difficult to orgasm while on ecstasy/mushrooms, I knew this because I had noticed the sun was coming up and the music turned off (music turns off at 6 am) and we were still having sex, while she finally began to orgasm around this time. We had eventually stopped, not because of one another having an orgasm, but instead because we were really sweaty and exhausted! After soon falling asleep together too tired to put clothes back on.That morning I made sure I had her number and I had walked her back to her campsite and gave her a good bye hug and kiss.All in all, this weekend was a true, spiritual experience.I have had an epiphany that life is too short to be shy and timid. I now have conversations with strangers everyday, without any awkward pauses or anything! It's great and I think I may have lost my ego this entire weekend and it has yet to return.J and I are still talking everyday and everything is going super well. This was my first rave, and definitely is not my last! One day I decided to go out with some  friends, to a club. I had consumed a lot of alcohol, fast. I was feeling a bit shy, so when the opportunity arose I decided to take a key of ketamine, for the first time. At first I felt like the world was at my feet - for about 3 minutes. Then I started to feel queasy, so took a trip to the ol' toilets with a friend. I did not realise I was in a toilet but thought I was in a spinning like open white space. I. threw up. I curled in to ball, thought I was going to die, could not move and wept. I went home alone.

Mephedrone has jumped up and grabbed my generation with its gurny claws and doesn't seem to be letting go. Having watched too many of my friends completely fuck up over this, lets face it, unknown and dangerously moreish substance, I felt the need to find something new and less addictive for my closer buddys to get into. Sounds dubious I know but it made sense to me.So after some reasonably extensive research I purchase one gram of this 4-meo pcp off a reliable online vendor,with intent to give it a dummy run the next week. Most certainly would have stuck to this plan if it wasn't for my oldest and most unreliable friend Jack Daniels. Friday comes, I have a barbeque at mine for an old friend. One litre later and I'm upstairs weighing up my dose of the 4-meo. After my research I had decided that 150mg would be perfect for a first try, with an initial tester of 5mg to ensure it doesn't react funny with me in some way. What I was thinking when I dropped two 150mg bomgs I don't know. Fuck it, lets see what this legal shit is made off...F all! Its fake I've been mugged off. Balls. If anyone is planning on trying this substance please listen to me when I tell you it takes a while to kick in. It took around two hours for me to feel anything. In those two hours I figured I'd purchase a a gram of mephedrone along with a few friends and take the night up a notch. Before I knew it the meo had crept up and took a stop watch to my head. Everything was stopping... I had the urge to do nothing but nothing. Now my eyes are closing. The next two or three or four or five hours (time was very hard to keep track of) were spent in this comatosed state. I suppose it could be comparable to ketamine, except when on ketamine it'll wear off half an hour later and I can get in bed and get to sleep (or re-dose). This substance had a much more sharper edge to it - THIS is how I felt and was gonna feel like for a LONG time. A minute felt like an hour, hour felt like a day, you get the picture. CEV's were moderate but that could be put down to the mephedrone, to some extent. The feeling just seemed to consume everything... has to be some strong stuff if it overcomes the buzz of mephedrone to such a degree. Once I came off this peak I was left in am almost agitated state where I just wanted to return to normal and get to sleep but it just wasn't happening, even after a few spliffs.I would not in any way call the primary effects of this substance enjoyable. That being said, I will try this again at some point in the not so near future; sober and at a lower dose. I'm not gonna bore you with all the chemicals I've previously done but its pretty extensive, and I can say with conviction that this chemical is a force not to be reckoned with. After a long night of drinking [7 or so drinks], I got home around 6 am and desperately needed to get to sleep. I'm an insomniac, and I was all out of any medications I usually use to sleep, so I took 4 3mg melatonin pills. I fell asleep nearly instantly (possibly because of the long night of drinking.) But about 20 minutes later, I woke up with a huge hangover. It was head-splitting, and I couldn't get back to sleep for the life of me. I disregarded the melatonin and figured it just hadn't worked. At about 10 am, the head-splitting hangover was gone, but I felt groggy, lazy, unable to focus, and out-of-it. I wasn't happy anywhere I was, and my eyes felt like they didn't want to be open. When I closed my eyes, all of the colors behind my eyelids were vividly turning into shapes, it was all very trippy.At noon, I had to go out for lunch with my dad. I still hadn't slept, and all I felt like doing was lying down. My heart felt like it was racing but it wasn't. I was scared I was going to just blank out and zone away in the middle of the restaurant. I played sodoku to keep my mind awake, and somehow made it through the awful experience. Recently I was involved in a rock climbing accident, and although there was no real damage to my body, I was having terrible muscle spasms in my back. My doctor kindly prescribed me some 10mg Flexeril. I took it throughout last week during classes, and I found it made me very relaxed and spacey. Almost like being really high, but not quite as fun. So Friday rolls around, and we plan on going out to the bar. I took my regular dose (10mg) in the morning, approx 10am and anticipating a night out drinking, only took 5mg at 5pm. I started pregaming for the bar, with my 3 friends. We picked up a handle of Old Crow Whiskey. I had 2 large drinks of whiskey/red bull, and 2 more of whiskey/ginger ale. We then attempted to walk to the bar at 9pm.That is where I blacked out.  Upon waking up in the morning, my friends made fun of me to no end. Apparently after getting to the bar, I sat a table outside alone, playing with my hands like an autistic dinosaur. I also tried to pick some girl up, but instead of talking i was only making gibberish noises...Sounds like I had a great time, but mixing booze and flexeril was probably a mistake. Some friends and I ordered a few grams of MDAI on an internet website that we'd ordered other chemicals off before. I researched MDAI and honestly, had low expectations. My preferential chemicals are Methylone and MDMA. I had taken a couple months off doing anything other than alcohol so, I was excited to try something, but had read many descriptions of others taking this chemical with little or no effects.  We took 100mg dose mixed with liquid and had a couple of drinks (2 or three strong drinks). Not alcoholics anything, but we drink quite a bit, so when we started to feel it, we questioned ourselves and thought it could be the alcohol.  About 25 minutes after initial dose we knew it was more than the alcohol.  I had an inexplicable happy feeling and felt as if I could talk forever.  People I had been pissed at just an hour previous suddenly became my best friend.  The feeling was a lot stronger than I had expected it to be and I really loved it.  Everyone in our group had the same reaction to the initial dose and we all decided to up it about 50mg a little over an hour after initial dose.  I'm not sure how much this did, but my high lasted a very long time. I peaked at about 1 hour and stayed at peak for about an hour. After that, I stayed pretty high for 2-3 hours.  I slept easily through the night (usually does not happen with me and methylone or MDMA).The following day I was drowsy, but felt great.I don't know why my experience differs so greatly with others.  I was thinking at first that maybe the website had sent us a different chemical, but if so, which one?  I have tried the others that would be similar and it didn't feel exactly like any of them.  Also, the alcohol??  Perhaps a few drinks really boosts it a lot, I'm not sure.  Either way, my experience was phenomenal and look forward to trying it again.

This could be considered more generally as a suspected non-consensual drugging report.]My first experience with this drug is not exactly the sort I would like to remember. I'm pretty open minded about drugs and I will try everything once and if I had of tried this knowingly and with some control over the dosage perhaps my impression would be different. Unfortunately though thats not the circumstances in which I was introduced to GHB.It started one night when a friend and I decided to go clubbing. Had a few drinks at home then drank profusely while at the club. I was very intoxicated the entire time I was out. I remember being approached by a lady about 35 years old at about 1:00am she had two rather seedy looking guys with her. She introduced herself and told me that one of the guys she was with was her brother and they had been admiring me from across the room and just wanted to let me know that I looked good. I was a little creeped out but flattered so I talked with them for about 10 minutes then headed out onto the floor to dance. I continued drinking throughout the night mainly vodka and jagerbombs and I was very very intoxicated but still enjoying myself. I met up with the same lady from earlier at the bar and one of the guys she was with I cant remember which one and she talked to me for a bit I cant remember what she was saying. Her male friend asked me if I wanted a drink and I had been talking to them for a while and felt somewhat comfortable and still very drunk so I stupidly agreed. He bought me a jager bomb and I didnt watch it the whole time and in fact turned my back on it to talk to someone who was behind me I cant remember if it was the girl or someone else. Anyways I downed it in one and took about five steps. Felt very sort of panicked and sick and I assumed this was because I had drunk too much too fast and I just needed to throw up or something. Headed into the bathroom and the lady followed me and I sat down on the toilet and sort of just started going to sleep with my head leaning against the wall. The lady was sort of touching me and I remember at some point she sort of tried to part my knees which I found strange and annoying but basically ignored because I was messed up and probably just being weird. Another girl came into the toilet and was concerned thank god. I remember her asking if the lady was my friend and where my friends were and I was not really very coherant sort of slurring everything when I did try and talk, she left shortly to get me a glass of water and came back pretty much immediately and gave me some water to drink. At this point I started getting really panicked. My breathing was really fast and sort of erratic. I couldnt really control my limbs and my mind felt sort of disconnected and I couldnt figure out why things were important like where my friends were. My reactions were insanely slow I couldnt make myself do really anything. I remember the second helpful girl who came in at one point grabbing my license out of my bag to find out who I was this bothered me because I was worried she would steal shit out of my bag but I couldnt get myself to react and tell her not to touch my bag. Soon the guy that was hanging out with the older lady came into the bathroom too and I think this is when the helpful girl probably got a little more worried. The older lady tried to brush her off saying they would look after me and the girl was telling them she didnt want to leave because she had been in a similar situation before and felt sorry for me. The guy then suggests that some speed will fix me right up so he wanders out to get some speed for me.This sounds like a really bad idea to me because I feel like I'm dying. I tell them I'm dying and I really dont need speed because I will die if I have it. They reassure me it will be just fine but I feel really worried. I half wonder if I will be fine if I take the speed but I'm really worried and I feel like I'm dying. The helpful girl asks me what my friends name is and I tell them and the guy offers to go and look for her. He goes out to find her (she tells me) he goes and asks her permission to give me speed. At this point my friend is like WTF, goes and gets the security guard who comes into the toilet and carries me out of the club. The helpful girl follows but the guy and the older lady disappear. They jump to the front of the taxi rank and convince the people in line to let me get the first taxi. They put me in the taxi with my friends and we go home.I had to get the cab to stop several times on the way home so that I can throw up. I keep talking about how I'm dying and I'm breathing really strangely. The taxi driver keeps telling I'm not dying and I'm okay. I tell him every time before I need to throw up and he pulls over. Eventually we get to my street and pull up across the road. I crawl out of the taxi and huddle in the grass retching really loudly and I remember worrying that I was too loud and my neighbours would come out. My very drunk friend tries to get me to hop up and come inside but she ends up more laying across my back and we sort of just stay like that. I dont remember getting up and going into my house at all. The next thing I know I wake up and I can see its light out the window. I'm lying on the toilet floor with my face in a puddle of vomit I remember being really worried because I feel like I'm still at the club but its really quiet and I'm worried that everyone went home and I'm locked inside the club. I look at my watch and it says 6:30am. Its really really fucking cold and I feel so sick I just lay my head back down in the vomit and go back to sleep. I woke up sometime after that once again thinking I was at the club but I remember the taxi ride and that confuses me how did I get back at the club. My hair is really wet with vomit and its freezing. I hear one of my family members in the laundry feeding the cat and I am worried the will come in and see my on the toilet floor lying in my own vomit. I dont want to get up because I feel so sick but I do anyway and I use some toilet paper to wipe up most of the vomit and I hop up and go to my bedroom. I'm so exhausted and sick and cold. I just undress completely and climb into bed. Makeup still on my face and vomit everywhere. When I wake up at lunchtime I still feel drunk and for the rest of the day I feel queazy. Later on I find out that the guy the older lady introduced me to as her brother is actually her husband and from what I can piece together they targeted me earlier in the night and had intended to get me to go home with them and have some sort of fucked up threesome. I'm just so lucky that there were concerned strangers that stepped in and didnt leave me alone with the creepy old lady and her pervy husband or things could have gone so much worse. I cannot imagine anyone using this drug recreationally when I just remember how much it felt like I was dying that night. THIS DRUG IS NUTSI'll start from the beginning.Me and my friends went to a random party down the block, and I ran into some other friends there randomly. My friend J was on this drug that he called 'Molly's hotter sister,' Molly as in MDMA. Then I ran into the guy selling it. This guy was tweaking out like crazy. His eyes were wide open and staring, he kept on licking his gums and his teeth and grinding his teeth, and he spoke in short, fast bursts. I decided to buy it because I don't really give a fuck, and it was only twenty bucks. He called it Megatron and Molly's hotter sister, so I was expecting it to be like a stronger version of MDMA. I wanted to save it for a night that would be fun to roll, so I didn't take it until a couple weeks later. I was hanging out with some friends at the park, drinking beer, and we were going to go to this house show by a really sweet band, so I decided this would be as good a time as any to take it. I was going to swallow it, but my friends said I should snort it, so I cut 5 fat lines on an issue of The New Yorker and snorted them all in about 30 seconds. It pretty much felt the same as snorting MDMA. Instantly, things started going crazy. My vision got really clear and bright, my whole body went numb, and I got this weird static in my ears. My friends were all pretty sober, so I was feeling kind of awkward being super fucked up, but they told me not to worry and we left for this house, which was about three miles away. We went on bike.The bike ride was amazing! My whole body felt great, my mind was racing, and I was clenching my teeth and swallowing a lot and basically acting like the guy I bought it from, but not quite so tweaked. The bike ride went normally, and we got to the house show, where about 75 people were sitting outside watching these guys doing this sort of lo-fi ambient set. The party was amazing, I felt great and talked to a lot of people, including some other people I know. They couldn't all tell I was on drugs, so I was holding my shit down pretty well. I drank about 5 beers and some whiskey, but I didn't really feel it at all. The cops came around 1 am, and so we went inside. They decided to move the show to another house, so we all biked over. I held it together for a while, but things get pretty hazy here. I remember sitting in a wheelchair and making a lot of jokes, and people were laughing a lot and I was on point pretty well. I was thinking fast, and I had this attitude that I didn't give a fuck about anything, so I was making fun of people and doing stupid stuff in general. Finally, around 3-4 am, the headlining band started playing. I bought 4 stiff drinks and slugged them back instantly, and then, while the band was playing, I was dancing and headbanging like a crazy person. This is when I started blacking out. The last thing I remember is picking up my bike and smashing it repeatedly against a car for no reason except that it was funny.I woke up in my bed, undressed and everything, around 11:30 am. It was 85 degrees F and extremely humid and hazy. I didn't know where my bike was, and I still felt fucked up on this drug, except in a bad way. I felt agitated, and I couldn't act normally or think rationally. I walked three miles to the house where the show was, and my bike wasn't where I left it. I looked all around the house, even climbed a rusty barbed wire fence, but the doors were locked and the person there was a crust punk passed out on some cardboard in the halfpipe in the backyard. He hadn't seen my bike.I decided to go buy a new bike at the store nearby, so I started walking over there. On my way I saw my bike locked to my friends bike on a pole. The back wheel was completely bent, the seat was fucked up, and the fork was bent pretty bad as well. My phone was dead at this point, so I couldn't call him to meet me, so I decided to buy a new bike anyways. I went to the store, but the bikes were all too expensive, so I started walking back to my friends house, another three mile walk. I knocked but he didn't answer. I started walking to another friend's house to use his phone, and I saw these rental bikes they have in the city, so I rented one. I biked to my other friend's house, used his phone, but I still couldn't get a hold of my friend who I was locked up with, so I just biked back to his house and tried ringing again. This time he answered, and we walked back to our bikes. At this point, I felt like total shit. I was still clenching my teeth and feeling agitated, I was sweating like a pig, and dirty as fuck. We unlocked the bikes, and I brought it to a bike shop to work on it. It took me two hours to fix it, and then the back tire popped as I was riding home. WORST DAY EVERIn conclusion, I would never do this drug again. I destroyed my nice bike, and I felt depressed and shitty for two days afterwords. While it was the most amazing high I've ever had, it made me act insane and I think I could've done some really fucked up shit had I been in a different situation. I probably would have beaten someone to death, or seriously hurt myself in some way. I was blacked out from 4 am to 7 am, and I have no idea what I might have done in that time, except that I made some random calls at 6:40 am. Basically, it's just not worth it. Moral of the story: Don't do random drugs! At the time of writing I am still recovering from my horrendous ordeal. Over 24 hours later I still have no desire to eat anything. I am not anti-drugs in any way. I frequently smoke hashish (without tobacco as nicotine makes me feel sick) and have done salvia divinorum and herbal ecstasy. I am currently researching 'magic mushrooms' as I feel I am ready to try them. I believe that people should have the right to try what they like, and be free from incorrect anti-drug propoganda from the government and other globalistic evil societies. I find it ironic that the drugs that cause the most problems (alcohol and nicotine) are legal in almost every country worldwide. Anyway, on to the experience...I have tried alcohol in small amounts before, at parties and at home, but never have I been 'really drunk'. I recieve a call from my girlfriend and she asks me to come drinking with her and her friends. I usually do not go in for this sort of thing, but wish to see her, as I have not seen her for a few days. I accept, the kids I am going with are all younger than me. When I tell them that I have hash with me they seem to become nervous, and I pretend I am only joking, to put their minds at rest. I never drink and smoke at the same time anyway, as alcohol diminishes the subtle effects of the magic smoke, so it doesn't matter.(T+00hrs)We reach the old warehouse where one of the kids opens his rucksack. He offers me a can but I decline. Then he produces a litre of vodka. They all try some but say it burns their throats. To prove them wrong I drink half the bottle in one go. It doesn't burn.(T+30mins) Things get bad. I had no idea that I would get this drunk. It was a stupid thing to do I know, but I learnt my lesson. Suddenly my girlfriend is on me. I immensly enjoy her company. After an hour or so, everyone goes outside so we can have some privacy. I realise that I love her. (T+2hrs) Everyone returns. I become angry. On of the kids is trying it on with my girlfriend. She rejects him and I resist the urge to punch his face in. I am normally very peaceful, but this anger scares me. It becomes hard to focus. I believe the wall is looking at me. I punch it. It doesn't hurt so I punch it again, and then again. Someone stops me. My hand is bleeding fairly badly.(T+3hrs) I get sick. My girlfriend is just as drunk as I am, yet she helps me. I can see blood in my vomit and what I think are chunks of flesh. We all decide to leave. We stagger to a nearby fast food restraunt and go inside. My girlfriend and I sit down, I    Knock over a chair in the process. The other kids buy food. I go to the bathroom and get sick again. I look at myself in the mirror. I am horrified. There is blood all over my clothes. My skin is pale and my eyes are red. I look like a heroin abuser, or some sort of hooligan.(T+3hrs 30mins) My father arrives. I kiss my girlfriend and leave her.  I get into the car. It is dark so he doesn't suspect anything. I am sure he wouldn't mind if I explained to him but I don't. As soon as we get home I go upstairs and lie down on my bed. There are three people inside my head. They are all arguing. Eventually, I fall into an uneasy sleep.Summary: For me, alcohol is a drug which doesn’t alter consciousness; rather it diminishes that consciousness which already exists. Objects remain objects, yet they are filled with a certain malevolent quality. It is destructive rather than constructive. It makes it impossible for a man to make good decisions. It fuels anger. From now on I think I shall expand my mind, and stick to psychedelics, instead of destroying it with alcohol. I was over at a friends place and we were board sitting around havin a couple of drinks. I had already had around two shots of vodka (straight) and her brother suggested that we try sumthing a little more interesting. Me being new to this whole 'drug taking' scene I eagarly accepted. He offered around an  eyedropper full of a clear liquid which he named as ghb. he told us to fill a bottle cap full, mix it into our vodka and sit bak and relax.I did just that and sat bak and listned to the music playing. About fifteen mins later I told him that I couldnt feel a thing, he suggeested I fill another capfull and hav a couple more shots of the alcohol. I did. Thirty mins after I did this I began to feel extreamly realaxed, the music began to feel more intense, my libido increased  and I was having a pretty good time. I decided to go for a walk to the corner gas station. Her brother and I got up and I was drifting in and out of a hazy euphoric feeling. I cant remember exactly what happened threrafter but I woke up in the morning with my underwear gone and a rather bad stomach ache.I didnt know what happened the night befor so I spoke to her brother and he informed me that I was feeling rather horny whilst on the drugs. I had had 'concented' sex with him and didnt even know it the next day. A couple of weeks later I went to the doctor and informed him of my experience. It was later found I was pregnantt and two months later I miscarried and hav not been able to get myself out of a depression since. I blame my miserable experience on ghb and reccomend that if you want to try it for the first time, make sure you are surrounded by people you trust (preferably the same sex). Dont let one ghb trip ruin your life as it did mine. Thanks for listning. I had been on a booze fast for 10 days because my tolerance had accidently gotten too high basically to the point where I felt nothing off four beers. I had been drinking 12 drinks a week 4 at a time for a month. Usually I only drink 8 a week but it was summer. I have been drinking since I was 14. Anyways I decided to stop for 10 days to try and bring my tolerance back down. This was due to my desire to not drink more.Anyways after those ten days I ended up drinking 4 beers over an hour and a half which is pretty slow for me. Surprisingly I was as drunk as I had been when I first started drinking. I felt great and fell asleep after an hour of fun. Basically I'm just curious about how fast one gains and looses alcohol tolerance because it seemed to me as if I had a large change over a short period of time. Of all the substances I have known, alcohol has been my worst. I have Asperger's Syndrome and am prone to depression, in retrospect I can see how these combined with alcohol led me down a dark path.I started drinking when I was about 14 years old, that's fairly typical in my country, I didn't drink for any other reason than the fact that it's the done thing. I would go out with my friends on Friday night, get smashed and repeat every week ad nauseum. I would always end up feeling very introspective, isolated and frustrated. I never thought about this too much, as I was still living with my parents so my life was fairly stable and drinking wasn't a regular thing, I just thought that social life was like that. I went to Uni at the age of 18 to 21, I was taking alot of E then and didn't drink very much, but times they change.After leaving Uni I ended up feeling very lost in the world, I felt like I didn't belong with everyone else, society made no sense to me and I felt powerless to control my own path, however, I could forget all my worries with a beer. A few beers and my mind slowed down, I could engage with people in a cheery, asinine way and that felt good. I was just like everyone else. I would now go out and drink a few times a week, and have a couple of beers after work. Simple. I met my current partner who would share my cheap cider and life was straight-forward, work a shitty job then come home and get a bit booze in me.Then I lost my job. Then another. And another. I wasn't pursuing my art anymore either. I wasn't doing anything with my days. So to fill in the gaps where my life should've been, I'd have a beer. I'd have a few beers. Then my girlfriend would come home and we'd go to the pub. It's what you do, and anyway, isn't drinking loads an amusing trait?The seams started to tear very quickly, the gaps of soberness started to get smaller and smaller, if I was bored, I'd have a beer, if I was frustrated with life, a beer. Depressed? beer. Party? beer. Had to leave the house at all? beer. I would wake up and finish last nights' 8% beer, then go and buy the cheapest, strongest booze I could afford.I completely lost myself in the drink. I would spend months at a time without ever really sobering up, my nerves were totally shot, my mind didn't work anymore, I could feel the world moving away from me as tried to drink myself to oblivion to dull the horror I was creating for myself. In Frat films the heavy drinker is the fun party guy, I became his nemesis. I was increasingly aggressive, always trying to start fights, I treated my girlfriend despicably, after all, I didn't care about myself so how could I care about anyone else? My stomach started to rot. My girlfriend would cry alot, my best friends didn't know who I was anymore. I wasn't a person anymore. I was a violent storm of self-destruction with no conscience.It's now been 18 months since I had a drink. I was fortunate in that the people closest to me had the moral fibre to wait for me to wake up. I don't think I'll ever escape from alcohol's shadow, the urge to drink grabs me when I least expect it. I'm not afraid to tell people I've had a problem, it's who I am now that counts. I also hope that my open approach might encourage others who feel they need help to ask for it. I believe that because alcohol is so interwoven in our societal structure, it can easily hide its negative side from scrutiny.Are weekend binge drinkers really so far from where I was?It's just a question of regularity. The following is a recollection of my experiences taking Mirtazapine (Remeron, Avanza..) in conjunction with various recreational drugs. I was prescribed Mirtazapine for depression and anxiety. I never got any benefit from it, though I was doing hard drugs a few times a month and that could have interfered with the treatment. I took Mirtazapine at doses of 15-90mg depending on what stage of treatment I was in. I’ve read from various sources that say the maximum dose of mirtazapine was 45mg but my psychiatrist insisted that 90mg would be fine. I will now list the various drug interactions with mirtazapine:Alcohol: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapineCannabis: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapineLSD: no response at all dosages of mirtazpine, I did not get high at all. Once, when I was not on mirtazapine, I was tripping on Acid and I used mirtazapine to come down. It worked very well; I fell asleep while I was still high which I think is very unusual.Ketamine: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapineDexedrine: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapineCocaine: no difference in response at all dosages of mirtazapineMDMA: Decrease in response during treatment with mirtazapine at dosages of 15-30mg, I had to take more mdma than usual to attain the desired effects. Very little response at 45mg of mirtazapine. No response at doses of mirtazapine above 45mg. I suffered no ill effects from combining mirtazapine with all of the above recreational drugs. I would not recommend that a person with depression use most of these drugs but I did and I respect your right to do so as well if you choose. I hope this information has been helpful.  [Erowid Note: The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]  The day started off by me and one of my friends doing shots from a bottle of vodka. We continued to take shots until I was pretty buzzed. I ended up drinking about a fifth of vodka to myself. I was to the point where I was 'blacked out' and don't remember much of what happened an hour after this. We had previously bought some magic mushrooms to take that night. These were very good mushrooms and the caps were gold in color. We ate them around 2 hours after the drinking. I barely remember eating them and even forget that I ate them. But then once they hit me I got a little scared and wasn't sure what was happening. But my friends calmed me down and I began to trip. Just as a background, I have taken shrooms at least 8 times before this. I knew what to expect and how to handle it. I remember laying in my friends living room and looking at the ceiling and the lines in it looked as if they were waving and moving back and forth. I stared at the ceiling for quite some time and was very entertained. Then I seen a wooden statue that had been carved to look like a Native American. I looked at the face and I could have swore that it was trying to talk to me and I thought it was evil. I had to turn it towards the wall because I couldn't handle looking at it. I liked the experience with alcohol due to the fact that it increased the effect and also I felt the shrooms a lot sooner than I ever had. But I was kind of mad the next day because I didn't remember much and kept hearing new things from my friends that I did that night. But overall it was one of my favorite trips. Warning: THIS TASTES HORRIBLE. Be prepared to brush your teeth directly afterward, and still deal with a crappy after taste.A little background: Alcohol is involved. I, admittedly, do not have a very good tolerance to alcohol.  Only one shot was consumed, and I am very certain I can handle one shot.I had purchased a small bottle of common sage essential oil because I love the smell and hoped to possibly create a candle out of it.  I never found the time, and a while later I stumbled upon an online listing of the herb as a potential psychoactive.  I never realized that this common culinary herb was such a close cousin of 'Salvia,' or Salvia Divinorum which is supposed to produce a short trip.I have never smoked Salvia Divinorum, so I have no way to compare the two, but this is what happened.I became curious, and decided to try the Sage oil.  It packed a very powerful scent, so I figured whiskey (namely Jack Daniels 80 proof, to be exact) would be a great way to cover the taste.  Boy, was I wrong.  The Sage was way more powerful tasting than the whiskey.  After brushing my teeth, I still had to deal with the after taste for a few hours.  Cigarettes helped numb my taste buds, but not by much.I put ten drops (from the dropper included with the essential oil) into one 1 oz shot glass already full with the whiskey.  Cheers, and down the hatch.  Fifteen minutes later, I began feeling a little 'warm and fuzzy.'  The best way to describe it is that it felt like I had four glasses of wine.  It was notably  more of a 'wine-drunk' than a 'whiskey-drunk,' although I could not consider myself being drunk.So, if I ever find myself with only a shot or two of alcohol left and still want to feel a real buzz, I might do this if I were desperate.  It definitely helped screw me up, but it tasted so nasty I might never want to do it again.I never made those candles, by the way. I can no longer stand the taste or smell of sage. Well, I did it again. Kids, don't mix xanax and booze, although it is about a fun freaking buzz. I've tried it all, but there is something obliterating about benzo/ethanol cocktails. Like sugical anesthesia. Only it will also put you in jail quicker than shit, as you may do things under the alkiebenzo blackout influence you'd never ever do sober (like breaking into houses, vandalism, unwelcome comeons to the opposite sex.). I'm facing 2 years in prison for a temazepam/vodka dui crash that broke another dude's ribs, so be careful!!! So, I bought some Kava Root powder from an online vendor. About 4 oz. I’ve drank about 2 oz. so far. And my current experience starts 45 minutes ago. I usually drink this stuff as a tea free from alcohol and find it to be nice and relaxing prepared that way. But I decided on a little Kava mixed drink. I have cinnamon flavoured Kava that is Hawaiian Mahakea and of very good quality. I enjoy this stuff with apple juice quite a lot because of the cinnamon. I tried it without straining the Kava powder, and enjoyed it that way best. But this time I added about 3 oz. of rum to a glass then throw in the cinnamon Kava. I put in about 8 grams of it, stirred and let it sit for 15 minutes. After the 15 minutes was up I dipped my finger in the thick mixture of Kava and rum and dapped it on my tongue. It went about as numb as cocaine makes my tongue. I added apple juice to it and was ready to go. I stirred it up one last time and gulped it all down.After ten minutes or so I felt very buzzed from the alcohol. No Kava effects, other than a slightly numb mouth. I noticed about 15 minutes ago (which was 30 minutes after ingesting it) that I felt extremely sedated and euphoric. I felt and still feel very happy. I’m surprised at the effects because 8 grams in tea have never felt this potent. This is something I’d definitely try with a little alcohol again. It’s much nicer than being drunk, and very potent at the same time. I threw a little MJ in the mix just now as well and the synergy is quite nice, as I also noticed with the tea.Kava is a great drink the relieve stress, and while it’s great with alcohol I typically use it to avoid using alcohol. In efforts to soothe a hang over and curve the chance of permanent liver damage in the future, I ingested some milk thistle. I heard it has alot of health benefits. When I purchased a bottle, I read the back to see if there were any precautions I should know about. Since I was not on any serious medications that might negatively interact with milk thistle and I was not allergic to daisy or ragweed type flowers, I figured it would probably do more help than harm.I used to drink alot more, but have since cut my drinking to mostly weekends because I just feel like shit the next day sometimes and don't wanna become a alcaholic. The mornings after a long night of drinking, I would feel real queasy. So if I didn't have my milk thistle with me and I slept over a friends house, I would feel like utter shit next morning until I went home and took my dose. I would be sure to get some food in my belly as well since that helps soak up the booze. Food of course also helps with hangovers for me. Oh yeah... and water, lots of water.  When I take one pill before drinking and the morning after it does the trick to help get rid of that awful quease and wretching of my liver. I also find that it helps reduce the spins if taken before drinking.This is an investment well made if you ask me. Not horribly expensive. aprox 23.45  - 1 small key 15-20mg23.53 Feel very happy good to talk to people over the phone, would be worried about being in public due to gurning as normal for me with stimulants and serotonin antagonists.12.16 Had another 15-25mg key going for cigarette enjoying feeling deep breathing and the feeling of 'coming up' again. Product very morish even though I know I have important things to do tomorrow also had 1/3 litre of vodka done with 2 drinks vodka and orange 50/50Went for cigarette, still a bit gurney but feeling good, nice an replacing with a rush running in the back ground similar to mdma.

But my experience with chemicals in this category is that if taken in moderation than the negatives are similar to drinking.Bigben60 - taken most drugs besides crack and heroin I'm 19 years old and an almost daily pot smoker. I use it mostly for insomnia, along with ambien, bennadryl, melatonin, basically any sleep aid I can get my hands on. I rarely drink, but since I'm dry on weed I decided to have a couple earlier tonight at a friends house around 10 PM. I barely got drunk at all, and around 1 AM I drove home (not under the influence). I had a single mike's hard lemonade that I brought home with me, which I just used to wash down a 3mg melatonin. This was roughly a half hour ago.I'm now feeling intense nausea, and panic attack-like symptoms similar to what I've felt with high oral doses of weed. Lots of chest pain, and some difficulty breathing. I had a similar expierence with alcohol and ambien about a month ago. Again, I drank so little that I could not feel the effects of the alcohol. I got home, took an ambien, and went to bed. Woke up about an hour later and had intense feelings of nausea, panic, and sedation. Do not take sleep aids with alcohol. I have been a recreational user of dxm for about 7 months now. I would say I am psychologically addicted. There have been periods of time where I discontinued my use of it, for about a month last October, and currently. I am also a frequent consumer of alcohol. Lately I never seem to feel drunk at all that is until the point where I’m puking my guts up. I originally chalked this up to tolerance, being as I drink a lot. But it didn’t make sense to me that I didn’t feel that drunk no matter how much alcohol I consumed.I haven’t consumed dxm in over a month because I felt it was destroying my social life. I would stay home on Friday nights instead of going out with friends because I got more kicks out of dxm. I was also getting sick all the time and hurting my relationship with my mom. So I quit. But the really big plus side to it all is... I CAN GET WASTED AGAIN!!!!!I think this actually might be the kick in the ass I need to actually stop robo tripping:D I’m so happy. I’ve been trying to kick this shit for a while. It’s affected my life so negatively. I’m looking forward to this new chapter of my life. Well, the day started off with me mixing 10 mg of oxy into a 2 shots of vodka. It was fine, not feeling anything too special but being cautious I ended up waiting about 2 hours to see if anything happened. Well all it did was get me more drunk with less alcohol, and I have high tolerance.After 2 hours passed I take 20 more mg of oxycontin and start to drink vodka, after about 30 min I'm feeling a mixture of drunkness and euphoria. I've had around 200ml of vodka at that point. At this point I take some adderall, don't really know what it did since it was the first time I tried it but I received an energy boost shortly after taking it. I continue to drink and ended up with around a half litre and being tipsy, which is a great thing for me since it takes much much much more alcohol for me to feel tipsy. This was a great way for me to feel alcohol again and I loved and cherished every moment of it. My experience with trazodone is very positive.It helps with my alcohol addiction in that I can consume much less alcohol per day. Before the trazodone, I would need to consume at least 3 liters of, say Chardonnay, at 13% potency, per day to fall asleep. With 150mg trazodone, I need less than 1.5 litersto fall asleep. I know that is still a lot of wine, but it helps me not to need so much wine. I've been an alcoholic for about 6 months or so and it just seems like no matter how much I try to pull away from the stuff it just reels me back in. It's just recently gotten worse. I started off the night with a 14 oz glass of straight alcohol (gin, tequila,  and vodka mixed). I know, it sounds nasty, but I loved the feeling of it all going down my throat. And it makes you drunk faster -- that's what I was aiming for. I finished the glass rather quickly, like it was orange juice, or so. I was pretty tipsy at that point. I was on the computer, surfing the web, chatting online. I could still function yet I found that I would misspell alot of words, or I'd mix them up. It got worse as the booze soaked in. I was feeling great, and light, like a feather - haha. And all the things on my mind before didn't seem to matter, which was the reason I poured myself such a large glass.I then went back for more. I was chugging out of each bottle of hard liquor. I just kept on drinking, and taking more and more. I don't remember much past that. I blacked out for sure, for I woke up in my bed upstairs when the last thing I remember was being in the kitchen downstairs. I woke up surrounded in my own urine (gross, I know). I felt discusting and almost as if I were still a bit drunk. Needless to say, the hangover was HORRIBLE. It was my stomach that was aching. I was very, very miserable.  [Erowid Note: Most Coricidin contains CPM (Chlorpheniramine Maleate) which can be dangerous in high doses. See DXM Brand Warnings for more info.] I had began using DXM when a fellow student in a trade school with me told me about it. The first time I tried it, we got called back to my job (it's 24/7), and I was beginning to think that the shit didn't work. All of a sudden it just hit me. I've been a believer ever since.On this particular night, I was drinking with some employees from work, and I thought, what could make this night better. The answer was obvious. DXM. I went to my local store and purchased some Coricidin (Cough and Cold of course) and popped all sixteen of them. I drank about a fifth of Jack with the boys (a fifth is what I took total to myself, hey I got a problem). I got really messed up. I am prone to blackouts when I drink (hey, I said I had a problem) so I blacked out alot of it. Apparently, a neighbor saw me stumbling down the street (is there any other way?) and decided it would be a good idea to take me to the hospital against my protest. While I was in the hospital, they asked me what happenned. I remember most of the rest of the night. I told them that I took 16 Coricidins and drank on it. They asked me if I was trying to kill myself, because I took all those pills. I kept telling them I took them because I wanted to get high. They eventually got a urine sample, I'm guessing to make sure I wasn't on some other drug that I was lying about. They then released me from the hospital.I later got the drug results in the mail and I was negative on everything they tested for (including opiads) except for alcohol, which apparently they can test for on a drug test. This just goes to show, it is possible to pass a standard drug test on DXM. I had been drinking slowly but surely for a couple hours. My friend showed up with the 'powder' off the internet. I had drank bottles of cough syrup many upon many times, so I asked for a line, I snorted about .7 gm. don't ever try it cuz it burned badly. I ate the rest and I ended up really feeling it about 20 minutes after consumption. I went to meet with my girlfriend at a friends and when I showed up, I collapsed. I don't remember even driving myself or my friend with the dex there.  [Erowid Note: Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. Don't do it!] I heard a series of beeps before I opened my eyes. I awoke to find out I had stopped breathing long before I reached the hospital. My mom was told 'if he comes out of his coma, he'll most likely have severe brain-damage.' Luckily I was only in a coma 3 days and fine after full recovery. I haven't done 'ROBO' since! Three glasses of red wine before dinner. After dinner took two 10 mg (20 mg total) of Ambien. Rx prescribed by local MD for sleep disorder, but for 10mg only @ bedtime.Barely remember being taken to the ER by my Son as he thought I was having a stroke. Barely remember tests (EKG, blood) administered by ER personnel.Released after a lecture by ER MD...'read the label!'Never again - read the label!  [Erowid Note: Unconfirmed Serious Injury Report.

I was unconscious and vomiting for about 16 hours.  When I woke, I just could not stop vomiting and hiccuping.  I went to the ER eventually.  The doc told me I'd burned away the inner layer of my stomach.  I couldn't eat solid food for a week.  The hiccups left a sharp pain in my solar plexus every time I swallowed.After this experience my sleeping schedule reversed so that I was up all night and asleep during the day.  I ended up on Zoloft and mood stabilizers after this experience.  I took them for about a year while abstaining from alcohol.  They worked.I just got off the Zoloft recently and had my first drink in about a year.  I never drink more than one drink in one day now.  That is my new rule.  If I break it, I'm done.  I never want to go through that experience again.  I nearly died from that experience. I am 22 years old, and I am in good physical condition (I practice 2 martial arts and I play soccer as well) The fact of the matter is I thought I had reached a point of invulnerability when it came to alcohol. I would almost mix it with any other drug I was taking at the time because I felt confident I was able to control it. It is also true that I always kept a good relationship with alcohol, meaning I never felt the urge to drink and I would never drink by myself or during the week, period. The truth is though, that my friends and I were real monsters on the weekends. Even when I drank A LOT, I was able to puke and come back into the drinking without feeling the need to pass out. Throughout the years I built up my tolerance to the point that I would drink entire bottles of liquor by myself and make it through the night in pretty decent shape. But let me tell you my friends, this feeling of immortality was an illusion, and I almost paid the price BIG TIME.The doomed night started at about 8pm. I got to my friend's house and I walk into a shot marathon. It seems one of my friends had just gotten arrested for possession of a controlled substance, and my friends decided the best way to deal with it would be to start pounding vodka shots on his name. We went through a bottle of vodka in 20 minutes on 3 heads. By this time we were feeling tipsy enough to make sloppy decisions such as cracking open a bottle of Jim beam and starting pounding more shots. We killed half the bottle in another 15 minutes (this was a 1.75 litter big momma) We then decide to go to a bar. Me and one of my friends race with a pretty big Long Island Ice Tea. As soon as we finished (literally as soon as the big glass touched the table) my other friend comes with a round of Liquid Heroin shots. After that my stomach rebelled big time. The time was around 10pm. I got up to go to the bathroom in order to vomit, and the room started spinning brutally. My thoughts were racing in my head and the word 'puke' seemed to echo in my mind. As soon as I hit the bathroom I vomit convulsing violently in the sink (the stall was occupied) I feel a little better to I walk back to our table.After a few hours my friends and I go back to their apartment with some girls (I had no idea who they were or what their names were) As soon as we hit the apartment I start taking shots with one of the girls (who was morbidly obese by the way, although I didn't seem to care at the time) My friends, the girls and I went through the rest of the Jim Beam and an extra bottle of Absolut. The time was now around 2am. This seemed like a good time to play beer pong. After losing 3 consecutive times with the grotesquely fat lady as my partner I went into the bathroom and I puked for the second time in the night. At this point I felt for the first time that I just might have been losing control over the situation. I lost sense of time while sitting by the toilet bowl, and I remember being worried about my hands shaking too much. When I left the bathroom it was almost 3am according to the stove digital clock. All the drunk retards applauded my return to the party, and although it was my intention to pass out, they managed to persuade me to stay up. I would say half an hour later I was doing peach cagna shots (this is a 48% alcohol drink by the way) This is when memory becomes blurry. I remember taking at least 2 shots of cagna. My friend told me the next day that he saw me at some point dancing with the bottle of cagna in my hand. There was an Absolut loss of sensitivity at this point. I remember punching my own thigh just to check if I still had it. I apparently got into a fight at some point as well with one of my good friends (I woke up the next day with a lump on my forehead and an injured knuckle) So far this felt like a REALLY bad drunk episode, but little did I know that chaos was still to come. For some reason we all decide to go for a walk, but not without first eating a slice of watermelon spiked with Everclear (for those of you not familiar with this wonderful beverage, it's 97% alcohol and it's banned from certain states) This is when it all went seriously wrong. I absolutely had no control of myself and I only remember bits and pieces of what I did from then on. I will now tell what I did according to my friends. It seems I started getting very violent with one of the girls and one of my friends had to pull me off of her and take me for a walk. All of the sudden I sprint across the street and I jump on top of a stray dog that was feeding on garbage. Then after laying on the sidewalk for 10 minutes I get up and I punch my friend in the face (and fall in the process, hitting my head against the concrete) Apparently my friend (a true saint) dragged me back to the apartment.I remember vomiting very violently for a long time. It seemed it was never going to stop. As I'm puking I start crying for no reason and my knees give in and I fall by the toilet. I must have stayed there for an hour at least until I managed to sit up once more and puke. That when bile and blood started coming out. All I know is I woke up the next morning on a bed with a severe bitter taste in my mouth. It seems I started puking blood because in the process of violently sticking my fingers down my throat I managed to seriously hurt it. My friends carried me to a bed at around 6:30am.I would say this was one of the worst experiences of my life. I've been in K holes and bad acid trips and let me tell you, they were nothing compared to this nightmare. Granted there was no psychological problems... but I did think I was going to die that night, I thought my body was giving up on me forever.Since then I have not touched a single alcoholic beverage. Whenever I want to relax with my friends I just smoke a bowl and I tend to stay very still and just listen to music. I don't think I'll be drinking for a LONG time, and I will definitely not get wasted like that ever again. All I have to say is... don't underestimate alcohol just because is socially accepted. It is a VERY potent drug and it can actually KILL you. I've had many experiences with psychedelics, pills, alchohol, even cocaine. I planned not to smoke weed today but my compulsive urge to alter my mental state led me to this when my parents went to an unforseen party. I expected for the booze (drambuei) to hit my harder but I wasn't feeling it so I started smokin some cigs in my basement to pass the time. Feelin the normal sluggish effects of alchohol I thought the ciggaretes would barely affect me.About halfway through my first cig I notice tingly feelings in my limbs and a sort of inner peace as if I could stay there for hours. By the second one I strongly felt the effects of tobacco by being sure to hold in the smoke. By the third I could barely feel my legs with the tingling up to a pleasant buzzing in my legs. I could barely stand up as I'd suddenly be overcome with my own weight and gravity forcing me to sit back down. Overall this was a pleasant experience although I did vomit towards the end from walking around too much. I was in the ninth grade and on spring break.  I'd drinken before, but never gotten drunk.  I was eager to try it.  One night, everyone in the family went to bed around 10.  My father had two antique liquor bottles.  One had burbon.  The other had gin.  They had been laying there for months.  I figured, what the hell.  I began by taken a couple  sips of the burbon.  It was sour and I absorbed it the best I could.  I then took a big gulp out of the vodka  bottle.  It went down better.  Though my throat was burning a little, I headed for the kitchen to get a shot glass.  I had two shots of burbon and a shot of gin.  I then became very relaxed and started rolling around in my bed.  The way i felt was how heroine addicts described the peak of heroine.  I felt like I was being 'cradled in my mother's arms.'  I began to roll back and forth in my bed.  Something was on television, but it just seemed like a bunch of racket.  I began giggling. I staggered back to the liquor cabinet and took two more big gulps.  I think I put some music on the stereo.  I don't remember what it was.  I might have had a beer too. When I woke up the next morning hungover,  I watched 'Brestwer's Millions.'  He was hungover after a night in the movie too.  I kept a secret with our maid and told her I got drunk.  She kept it.  Overall, I liked getting drunk and have done it often since then. I am a heavy drinker so anything else I take I must first check for interactions. Finding no serious warnings of mixing Neurontin with alcohol, or finding any reports of such I decided to experiment.Around 8pm I took 8 300mg Neurontin pills with a bottle of mountain dew. While waiting for the pills to work I started my nightly drinking gin also mixed with dew. I thought the more soda I drank the faster the pills would kick in.About 3 hours later I was pretty drunk but not to the state of being out of control. The pills had definitely kicked in but not till I thought about it. I felt really floaty, almost like a small dxm mixed with weed type trip, but more euphoric.An hour later a friend came by and we decided to get some coffee at an all night coffee house. I took a few more pills before we left. There I consumed 5 regular coffees, it just tasted so good, I don't know if it was just excellent coffee or my mindset. We played cards and sang along with the karaoke for about an hour, something I usually hate. I just felt so sociable and happy.We then left and returned to my place where I popped a few more pills and had a few beers. We played the playstation 2 for hours and I just loved every minute of it.To conclude, I think the mix was an excellent and I never felt any ill effects. Woke up the next morning still high but not hung over or zombie like at all. I look forward to many more good times with this combination. It wasn't too long ago but I was fucked up enough to know that it works quite well. It was another party night with friends, six of us to start. I had pre prepped Jello shots as recommended on the box (one cup boiling water to a box as well as a cup of cold water then refrigerate). I simply replaced the cold water with cold vodka and added a gram and a half of coke to the hot mixture before adding my vodka. One can prepare it as one sees fit but in adding my coke to the still hot water and jello mix I am sure to have a very dissolved mixture.  I made the mixture and poured them into 1 oz. (liquid) paper cups it made about 15 filled pretty much to the top. I'm messy so I did spill a paper cup worth or so. Really its quite simple to make. The experience was great. At any rate the jello shots do hit pretty good. They take like a dose of anything consumed but they hit pretty smooth to start. I cant really taste the coke but it makes my mouth and esophagus numb pretty much as it should. The alcohol hits first of course because it leaks through your membrane on its way to the belly. This concoction really gets me going. I had a drunk feeling at first for like 15 minutes after scarfing down two 1 oz cups right away. Not wasted but buzzed, then after about 15 or so minutes I felt this adreneline-like rush and my stomach went south. I felt really light headed then just high for a good 15 minutes then I ate one more and maintained that high I think the coke and alcohol mixture prolong the effects of each other. Some folks like just being high or just drunk because they can't deal with the back and forth of having both at once but jello shots are a way of easing myself into a nice buzz. The more the merrier you know what I mean. I can adjust the ratio to my liking but its the first time I made Jello Coca shots but it was good. There were enough to share with my 5 peeps and I still had some left the next day (in case a jones set in). Whatever though some people dont have the energy and money to get busy with this idea but if you just copped a ball and you hate the stigma of snorting smoking or what have you  you may wanna get creative..... surprise your friends with your vast knowledge of culinary pharmacology! Recently ive been experimenting with alot of different drugs and medications, then I found a bottle of effexor (Venlafaxine). I decided to pop 2 effexor pills (75mg each) and took some alcohol with it. Be warned that this is not a good idea to mix effexor with alcohol, but I considered the risk and took it anyway.I downed the pills about about 6pm and sat back a drank a few beers. Around 30 min later I started to feel very dissy and began to get lightheaded. Shortly after that I felt very isolated, and felt very relaxed but strangely frightened at the same time. I also felt strong nausea.At about 7:30 pm I became very drowsy, and my speach was extreamly slured, I tried to walk to my kitchen but found myself stumbling over myself. I convinced myself that it was just the alcohol so went back into my room and laid down to watch TV. As I tried to watch TV, I noticed movement in the corner of my eyes. I cant describe what I saw exactly but it was like a bunch of flies were flying all around.Shortly after, at about 8 pm I get very sleepy and passed out.I woke up the next morning feeling very strange, like I would the next day after smoking alot of marijuana, but it was more than that, I felt isolated from everything, I couldn't focus. This was a very weird experience, one that I will not try again because of the effects during and after taking the drug. I was prescribed alprazolam for my anxiety problems, and knowing that it's commonly preferred in certain circles, I decided to try more than I was prescribed. At first I took 2 pills (1 mg), and waited for an hour for the effects to kick in. It affected my mind only mildly, and I felt somewhat disoriented, and a slight impairment in muscle coordination. Nevertheless, no significant or desired alteration happened to my mental state. My friend then consulted me, that I should take at least 1 mg more of that stuff. I did that, and started to drink beer in the hopes of some kind of euphoria that I have read and heard from others. After the fourth beer it started to kick in. It felt like I have drank double as much as I actually did. For some reason (this was very stupid, as you will soon find out) I decided to take 0.5 mg more. After that I had a complete blackout, and woke up very dizzy and disoriented after 5 hours. The bed was full of urine. I was fucked up and mad to myself. A few days after that I took only 1 mg when drinking heavily, passed out and had no hangover, which is a miracle and a good side effect of this drug :) The conclusion: I had no desired and good effects with alprazolam alone, but with alcohol it kicks in and hard. My friend and I had wanted to get drunk for the longest time, but we had no idea where we could get it from, finally someone offered to get us some, we had no idea how much we were supposed to drink or anything about it. Everybody told us to watch our limits, but we had no idea what the limits were. we werent going to drink the 26 of bacardi we got until there were more than just 2 of us there, but we just wanted a little taste. we opened the bottle and really liked it and had 3 shots to begin with, we felt dizzy but we didnt think that was everything to it, we we had 4 more shots and by this time we were pissed outta our mind. there was a little less than half the bottle left so we decided just to finish it off. that was probably 3 more shots each. as soon as i got up i fell over and started puking my ass off all over her bedroom floor. it was only like 3 in the afternoon and my friends parents came home to see that i had been puking everywhere, and my friend had no idea what to do. i was puking and couldnt get up for about 5 hours and kept passing out and waking up about 5 minutes later on and off. we told her parents that we just had way to much candy and junkfood.my friend was told to go and get my parents to help me up, my mom came and told me to get up to walk home (right across the road) i couldnt move,  every time i moved i would puke more and more. finally she got the car and came to pick me up and they dragged me out to the car. i got home and as i walked to bed i puked all over the floor. i passed out and fell asleep for 14 hours. as shitty as that experience was, we went out and got pissed off our ass again the next night, but this time we knew our limits. The first time and only time I got drunk was a nightmare for me. My friend and I are both 15.  I told my older brother that we were going camping in Grandpa's woods and wondered if he could get us some beer, so my faithful brother came home with a 12 pack of Budweiser for us.  My friend, whom I'll call 'Adam', and I went back to the woods, started a fire and relaxed.  I got the beers from a secret hiding spot in the woods and we began to drink.  The beers were a little warm, and Budweiser tastes really gross anyway, so it was a little hard to drink.  We had a few laughs and chugged a few.  Eventually I had finished my sixth and I started running around the woods, running into trees and doing stupid shit like that.  It was fun 'cause it really didn't hurt so much and I had a hard time walking.  I ended up breaking one of my grandpa's chairs and my gym bag got burned in the fire.  About ten minutes later Adam and I were wasted.  We tried walking around but he kept falling down and he puked.  I laughed because I saw onions in his puke.  Things got really horrible from here on.  I'm usually spooked at night in the woods, but with the alcohol I really didn't care.  We stumbled through the woods.  Adam kept falling down.  He seemed like he was passed out, so I talked like crazy.  I kept saying how I couldn't believe the chair was broken.  The whole thing seemed like a dream.  I began talking about my secrets and stuff I really shouldn't talk about.  I told Adam about how I had felt gay before.  These are feelings that I would rather forget about and move past.  We joke around a lot about being gay, but I was really telling him.  It was really fucking scary, but I started to get attracted to Adam.  In the sober world I find him not attractive at all, but I kept asking him if he would kiss me, and he said he would.  Luckily I could control my retardation and stop myself from doing something stupid.  When he got up I did kiss his shoulder, though.  We did other really gay stuff, like I rubbed his chest and layed on top of him when he fell down.  This stuff was really embarrasing and I'd rather just forget about it.  We walked into the creek, walked back on a path and somehow got back to the camp area.  I have no idea how we managed to get back to the campsite from the creek.  When we returned I felt really sick to the stomach.  I have a strong stomach and I didn't puke, but I felt horribly nauseous and my head was spinning.  I began to pray to God to help me get over this.  I had said and done so much stupid stuff, I was ashamed.  I began to question my life, and I felt like I was a horrible person.  I told Adam about all the bad things I'd done.  I felt like I let my mom, dad, brothers, and friends down.  I hated myself and I hated this situation.  I hated absolutely everything about being drunk.  Sure it was fun the first 10 minutes, and it was fun being numb.  But I felt so sick to my stomach and I hated how I blurted out all those things to Adam when he seemed to be passed out, but he remembered most all of what I said.  He kept telling me that I kissed his shoulder the next day.  I felt like I wasn't worthy of God's love and I missed my mom and dad.  I went to sleep for maybe an hour, woke up, and told Adam more embarrasing stuff about myself.  I even asked him if he thought I'd go to hell if I died.  I slept for maybe two more hours and awoke feeling fine, no headaches at all.  But I did still feel a little sick to my stomach the rest of the day.I totally don't understand why people are into drinking.  Even without a hangover or vomiting, my experience was not fun at all.  There are too many side effects, and it's only pleasant for about 10 minutes.  I think alcohol is not worth it at all because:1. It tastes like shit.2. It makes me say stupid shit.3. It makes me do stupid shit.4. It makes me feel like shit.Maybe if we had something that tasted good and was cold, like hard lemonade or wine coolers it would've been more pleasant.  But I still vow never ever to get drunk again. A few months ago, I realized that teens really need to pace themselfs and know their limits. I had drank hard booze many times before, but this experience has changed that. Im a 17 year old in high school, and got some booze from a friend on a Friday. He has given me a coke bottle filled to the top with 100 proof gin and a 5oz flask of Bacardi 151. my mom was working late, so I figured that night i'd drink a little. I do suffer from depression, and at this time I was on no medication, but I didnt feel depressed that day or week.  i sat at my computer taking gulps out of the gin bottle. I then fell over in the chair I was in because I was headbanging to some music. I got up, laughing, and did it again. I also fell again. the second time I fell, I remember thinking 'holy fuck that hurt...I think I broke a rib...this isn't so fun anymore.' but i got back up. i remember at this point that the bottle was half gone. I then woke up, rather my memory was working when this happened. I was in the shower with my clothes on and my mom was crying and asking me what i took. i was slurring out 'fuck you I didnt do anything, I didnt take anything, im fine leave me alone.' If I was sober I would have realized that she wasnt going to leave me alone. she helped me to the car and we drove to the hospital, and I experienced every emotion we humans have on the way there. laughing, crying, i could not control myself. I could not walk alone into the hospital, I needed help getting in there. when i got into the hospital bed, my mom pulled out the coke bottle and the flask. she told me they smelled of booze, but had nothing in them. I was in shock, i could not belive i drank that much. I was in the hospital for 8 hours or so, and nursed a 3 day hangover afterwards, while pissing razors from having a tube stuck up my dick and a bruised rib.I don't tell people not to drink and do drugs, that would make me a hypocrite. I still smoke, drop acid and have a few drinks now and then. but this experience really makes me understand that we teens, the underexperienced, need to know our limit. I had to replace the carpet in my room and gain my parents trust back because I got to drunk to realize when to stop. I had been taking Effexor XR:150 MG per day.I went without prescription for about 5 days, felt mild typical withdrawal symptoms. Decided to have 4-5 drinks (I have a good enough tolerance to handle way more than this.) This was followed by about 10-11 hours of vomiting. To the point where I couldn't even hold down water. I was very confused, pale, and had difficulty walking. I was taken to the hospital where a huge needle of Gravol was administered. I then slept for about 12 hours, woke up for two, then was still able to sleep for another 7-8 hours. I read up on the internet about 'red-rock' opium before hooking up. It's been available for God knows how long. I will admit it has no attributes related to heroin or oxy-cots, but it fucked me and my boys up last weekend. We usually can't chug a half-gallon of vodka - each! And then go to work 3 hours later. I whipped out the smoke as we drank and talked shit until sunrise. Our memories and energy levels contradicted each other. No matter what I read about red-rock, I maintain my own opinion. Every time I fuck with it, weird shit happens and I regret it the next day! I seriously doubt the stuff I get is dragons blood, it's more effective than 'chronic'. In fact everyone that smoked the red-rock, the next day thought they smoked high-grade pot. I can guarantee you they didn't. We never know with red-rock. This was the craziest thing I ever saw while messed up, whether acid, shrooms or whatever I'm familiar with seeing things that may not necessarily be there but this experience was different in that I wasn't expecting it. I've always been a big fan of drinking some booze and then smoking a joint or six. My friend and I had been drinking Canadian Club whiskey and watching TV/shooting the shit when he suggested going outside to smoke this fat joint he had. I agreed immediately and we commenced to smoking the weed in my parent's backyard. We finish the spliff an go back inside to watch more TV or whatever. We hadn't been sitting down for more than a few minutes when I see what I will refer to as a shadow person walk through the room. He was about my size but completely black and transparent - like my shadow had got up off the ground and taken a walk around. This thing was scary and I was sure it was staring right at me. It walked through the centre of the room and then behind my parent's bar where he crouched down out of view. Like I was in remote control I got up from my seat to see if this shadowy bastard was lurking back there. On the walk over my mind was screaming at me to turn back but I couldn't stop. Once I looked behind the bar he was gone. When I turned back to my friend he was all freaking out, so I helped him outside and got him a glass of water. Once he'd calmed down enough he was able to tell me that he had seen the shadow man too but standing behind the TV. Afterwards we just laughed about it and kept drinking/smoking but sometimes I think back on it and still get a chill. wondering whether this was just a hallucination or some entity that our altered state allowed us to see. I had been going out with my girlfriend for about 7 months and it came to the night when we were goin’ to lose our virginity to each other. I had started taking piracetam with a friend a few days before hand, and had liked the effects of it. I took like maybe 5 grams that day, including some right before she came round after my parents left. I was really nervous as well so I drank some of my parents alcohol to calm my nerves, which was a big mistake. Piracetam increases my sensitivity to alcohol, so that small amount that I drank felt like absolutely loads. So to cut a long story short, the alcohol-piracetam combo made me feel really drunk, and when it came to it, I couldn’t get it up. I improvised, but because we're both shy, and her parents quite protective, opportunities like that don’t come along very often. I didn't get another chance, because she dumped me a month ago. First off, I bet many of you are like, 'Wha? Lemon... extract??? Mint extract???'Yup, that's right, lemon and mint extracts. This will outline some recipes and my experiences.Me and 3 of my friends, I'll call them T, S, and W, were trying one night to get some alcohol, so we asked some dude at school (I'll call him R) and he said his dad would buy us some if we gave him the money. So we went to his house and rode with his dad to the gas station and then he asks him if he will buy us alcohol, he said no...Pissed, we decided on a last resort to go to the grocery store and buy some stuff to get messed up on.We purchased 4 bottles of lemon extract (84% alcohol), 2 bottles of mint extract (80% alcohol), 2 4oz bottles of robotussin, a 2 liter of coke, a 2 liter of root beer, and a 2 liter of brisk ice tea. We then headed back to R's house.None of us had ever done the lemon extract thing, so we were trying to figure out who goes first and how. We made the following with the extracts (we used the entire bottles of extract in each glass): 1 glass of LE (lemon extract) and brisk ice tea, 1 glass of LE and root beer, 1 glass of LE and water, 1 glass of LE and coke; then we used half out of each of the bottles of ME (mint extract) like this: 1/2 ME in a glass with brisk ice tea, 1/2 ME in a glass with root beer, 1/2 ME in a glass with water, 1/2 ME in a glass with coke.Then we each started drinking and sharing to see what each of them tasted like. Here are the results:-LE and Brisk Ice Tea: This was the only one that didn't taste bad, this tastes like sweet ice tea with lemon, very strong lemon.-LE and Root Beer: Terrible! I had to hold my nose to down a few gulps of this putrid mess.-LE and Water: Again, terrible. There was nothing to really mask the taste of the LE so it was just like drinking the LE, just a little weaker.-LE and Coke: Another bad mixture, and like the root beer: CRAPPY!-1/2 ME and Brisk Ice Tea: We should have known better than to mix ME with anything... I would rather drink my own piss...-I'll go ahead and not waste time by saying that anything mixed with ME is not going to taste good...Well, after we had finished all the extracts (yup, even the ME, couldn't let em go to waste), we felt pretty messed up, like being drunk without stumbling and having more control over yourself, but still dumb nonetheless. Me and T lay on the floor burning incense and would get a mouthful of the smoke and blow purple rings. This was so awesome. We did this for like an hour and a half.Then we turned the lights off and rolled around on the floor in the small room until R got scared and then got pissed and turned on the lights and left. He was pissed the rest of the night (don't know why) and tried to beat up W for saying that it was cold, W threw his ass down. Overall a pretty mellow night. BTW, T had drunk one of the bottles of robo, and the other was split amongst us, about 1oz each.About a week later me, T, W, and S went to my house to do it, we each did a bottle and a half of LE in some Brisk (like I said before, it's not bad at all). Got drunk, had fun.Another week later, we went to my house again and we had a ton of LE (8 bottles, 2 for each of us). Me and T did 2 but S and W said they were set with one, then T said he was set with his 2, so I drank the other 2, that stops me at 4 bottles, not smart... I didn't get messed up AT ALL. I have no clue why, all it did was give me terrible stomach aches for the remainder of the night and the next 2 days. It was bearable, but not pleasant.I never did it again after that, that sort of screwed it for me. That and the fact that I started getting weed instead.Well, I must say I recommend it, but only a bottle or 2 mixed in brisk ice tea, or homemade ice tea. A note of caution, DO NOT DRINK IT STRAIGHT OUT OF THE BOTTLE!!! I tested it to see what it was like, I took a small sip, felt like I drank acid. We told some of our friends at school, 3 of them tried it and drank a whole bottle straight. Two of them came to us and said they vomited really bad and it burned like hell, the other said it was fun. I guess his throat is made of steel. This is a report of my first and only time ever getting drunk. It was about 11 pm when I started drinking. I had never gotten drunk before so I just wanted to see what it was like. Being underage (I'm 19) I was not able to buy my own, but we have a liquor cabinet full of booze in my house. Well, this stuff is pretty old, and pretty nasty tasting, so I just picked the best looking one. It was something called Blue Caraco or something. Well, let me just say this stuff tasted horrible. I tried mixing it with orange juice to make it go down easier and it helped a little but not much. I'm not sure if the age of it had anything to do with the taste or the effects the alcohol had on me.Being only 125 pounds, it didn't take much for me to get totally smashed. About 10 minutes after the first glass, a small teacup filled about half full, I started feeling 'buzzed.' Not much, though. So I went and filled the cup up and guzzled that. Now, after a little while I started to feel pretty drunk. My vision was blurry and it was hard to walk straight. I was stumbling and swaying, laughing at myself. I tried to walk in a straight line (walking the tiles of the kitchen floor) like the cops make you do.I could almost do it but in a few minutes I wouldn't have been able to at all. During this time I was on the computer chatting with people and making a lot of typos, which cracked me up, as did just about everything everyone was saying to me. I do believe I'm a funny drunk. Well, after maybe 45 minutes I thought the stuff might be wearing off, so I had one more drink. That was my last one. I drank all 4 cups in about an hour's time.The first hour of being drunk was very fun. I found things funny and kept laughing at myself, and I was not depressed as I often am. I felt heavy. But then I started to feel nauseous, while still very drunk. I didn't know it would happen that soon; I thought the hangover would come later. I got off of the computer and crawled heavily up the stairs and fell into bed.  I think I just layed there and watched a little tv, wishing the feeling would go away. It was very intense. I don't exactly remember what happened next. I puked at least once, but I don't remember if I fell asleep before or after I puked. I just remember puking and not caring that it got all over my face and clothes and floor. Then I think I just passed out.I woke up the next morning around 11 feeling quite hung over and not being able to get out of bed. When I tried I just felt too dizzy. So I basically layed in bed and watched (or listened) to the tv for about 4 hours. I finally forced myself out of bed, not being able to stand the smell of the puke anymore. It smelled like the liquor. I still felt dizzy and nauseous and had to lay down a lot. I slowly recovered, but the effects didn't go completely away till about 24 hours after I stopped drinking.So, to sum it all up, getting drunk was about one hour of fun and 18 hours of misery and a few more fully recovering. Definitely not worth it. I honestly can't comprehend why people like to get drunk (unless my experience is different that others'). I'd advise anyone like I did. I was completely wasted and didn't know what to expect. And drink something that actually tastes good, and have something ready for when you vomit. And plan to spend the entire next day recovering. Myself and three friends decided to have a night of drinking.  The previous night, we discovered when smoking coltsfoot for taste, it boosted the alcohol and gave you a sense of complete fuzziness in the head (as opposed to a clear headed feeling).  I also was curious about salvia.  I started the night drinking about 4oz of fluid which was a decoction of salvia made from approx half a gram.  I don't think the decoction did that much overall, and to extract the chemicals some other method is needed.We (the four of us) then started drinking about half an hour after.  We went shot for shot and finished off the first bottle of 151 pretty quickly.  Then we sat around, I smoked most of a bowl of coltsfoot, the others only wanted a hit or two.  Then I decided to smoke some of the salvia.  We all agreed that like coltsfoot, the salvia also strongly boosted the alcohol.I am skipping the details of us listening to some music waiting for alcohol to come on, and the subsequent alcohol based conversations that occurred.  Furthermore, from this point on, I can't give any time related information as my sense of time was completely lost.  After smoking a few bowls of salvia, I spent a few minutes on the phone with a friend having an aimless conversation about pussy.On whim, I decided to start spinning around in circles.  My view was blurred, but I was able to clearly pick out which blur belonged to what object, like that brown is my friend, that white is the stove, that yellow is the table, that black is the window, etc.  And overall it was rather lucid.  I noticed that while I was standing straight, the room spun constantly; while I was spinning, I had a really good sense of balance and I could spin quickly while staying confined in a small circle of space.  We as a group then decided to go out for a walk.  All through the walk I was very hyper and bouncy, and I was jumping all over the place on top of stuff, etc.I noticed the whole time that I was feeling predominately drunk, and the salvia only boost.  We got back and drank some more, finishing off the second bottle.  I had a considerably harder time taking it down, and then I capped it off with some more salvia.  Right after those hits, the room started spinning even more and it was almost like an amusement park ride.  I got so dizzy that I ended up puking purely out of motion sickness.  After that the details got fuzzy though I do remember taking a couple sips of some beer before I passed out on my friend's couch for a couple hours.  I woke up and noticed it was 5.30.  Everyone else was gone, so I picked up my stuff and just headed back to my place where I slept for another four hours.I woke up this morning, feeling dizzy, and I'm typing this up still very very dizzy and with no appetite at all.  Overall though, while I did feel effects from some raw salvia leaf, I found that its really more just a boost for alcohol than anything else.  My friends really liked it that way and didn't mind the flavor smoked either.  Also worthy of mention is an herb that is used to treat bronchitis named coltsfoot also gives the alcohol a very nice boost when smoked. Alcohol is by far my substance of choice. But I don't really like being drunk. I drink to relax and to be social. I do drink quite frequently, so to the average person I'd appear to be an alcoholic, which I'm not. I just really, really, love beer. I usually drink to the point where I feel relaxed, slightly tipsy, more talkative, and warm-feeling. This usually occurs after about four or five 'lite' beers. Regular or Ice beer just gets me too drunk. I prefer not to drink it.Being really drunk is almost like being delirious to me. I slur every word, I say or do things you may later regret, my balance is fucked, and sometimes I make an ass out of myself. But if I am at a party and the alcohol is flowing heavily, I know I may end up drinking more than I planned. When I go to parties, I drink all night long and into the next morning without even feeling wasted or spilling my drink on the floor, with no hangover whatsoever. Here's how:1. Pace myself, because an alcohol buzz can really creep up on me, especially drinks made with hard liquor. 2. When I reach the point of feeling pleasantly intoxicated (warm, happy, sociable, relaxed), I stop drinking. This is the best part of an alcohol buzz. If I must sip on something (which I do) I usually fill my beer bottle with water. I always drink out of brown bottles so no one ever sees me do it. 3.Water is extremely beneficial to an alcohol drinker. Alcohol can seriously dehydrate me, therefore it is necessary to stay hydrated. Also, as mentioned above, it speeds the elimination process so I don't end up getting real stupid-drunk. So between my drinks, I take a few gulps of water. And before bed, drink at least two 12-oz. glasses.Some people like that sloppy drunk feeling. Not me. I do love beer more than anything in the world, but to me, being really drunk kinda sucks. I have had a lot of experience with alcohol and marijuana. I have used Ketamine, Lsa, cocaine, lsd, mushrooms, and loads of pills. I recently saw a bottle of sake (rice wine) in my house. I poured around 5-6 oz in a glass cup. Then I put it in the microwave for around 45 seconds. When it came out of the microwave it was pretty hot. I ingested the liquid at 4:30pm4:30: Just finished the hot sake4:35: Small buzz but I thought it might have been a placebo4:40: Feeling really good 4:45: Have a kickass high. Really strong buzz.5:00: The buzz/high is starting to wear off.5:30: Effects fully goneEnd result: Hot sake's effects kick in almost instantly but do wear off way faster then hard alcohol. K to start of I just recently tried salvia 20X extract and was really hit hard so I want to try something milder. My friend recommended that I smoke damiana leaf powder. So I went to the local health food store and picked up 500g of damiana leaf for about $12.00 when I got home I set up my surroundings and was feeling really good about myself I grabbed my coffee grinder and shredded all the leaf till it was powdery ended up with about 20gs of powder I turned off the lights so only my TV was one I sat down and packed a full bowl into my water bong, the smoke came so fast and it was really white it tasted quite good. I sat back and started to feel my legs and arms go numb my heart started to beat faster and faster I slowed it down by remembering it was the drug and breathing slower then it hit hard I started to drool so I decide to go to sleep the next day I went to the alcohol store and bought a mickey of everclear(95% grain alcohol)when I got back home I don't know why but I added all the 19 and a half grams of damiana powder to the everclear shook it for about 3 min then it was a green like absinth I sat down and was vary happy because it look good. So I turned on some music oh yea it was about 2:30pm after I turned on the music I sat at my kitchen table and drank 3 shots strait it was harsh I could not breath for a sec because of the high alcohol fumes 2 min later I got a bad head rush then I started to see my old dog it was weird he died two years ago all of a sudden like 20 of my friends surrounded me and started giggling at me then I think I passed out when I woke up it was 2:00 pm again I was really dizzy still but at that point I could not recall any thing I got up and turned on the TV and realized I had been out for two days on my floor overall it was fun to try but I would not do it again it. Last Saturday I was at a friend's house (let's call him 'A').  We were supposed to be studying for our exam and working on our assignment, but instead we procrastinated.  We surfed the web and walked around the block looking for unencrypted wireless networks.At around 6pm, we decided that we wanted the other guy in our 3-person class to help with the assignment (lets call him 'B').  So we phoned him up and eventually convinced him to come and help us with the assignment.A's parents weren't home.  So instead of studying and working on the assignment, we decided we would get drunk and watch a movie.It was my first time I had consumed any reasonable amount of alcohol.  I mean, I have had small amounts of beer and wine and cidar before, but not enough to do anything more than blur my vision slightly.So first thing we had was this weird brazillain drink which is supposed to be something like 50-70% alcohol.  I had 2 shots.  Then, we went through A's parents' alcohol cupboard and poored a tiny bit of every spirits bottle into one glass and I had 2 or 3 shots of that.It took about 15 minutes to take affect.  The movie we watched was 'Pulp Fiction', we watched the DVD in A's computer.  Whoa, that's a pretty fucked-up movie.  And the whole thing was quite funny.  All through it my vision was blurry.At 11:20pm, the movie finished and we turned up the speakers attached to A's computer to a level that probably woke up all his neighbors, and then played some of his trance music.  We did this for about 15 minutes.  Then B went home.  I stayed for another twenty minutes, then went home.  By this time, the effects of the alcohol had worn off, or so I thought.I went home.The week that followed was exam block, and it has just ended today.  Exam blocks are normally not fun.I should probably provide some background.  I am currently in my final year at high school.  I'm not sure when it was exactly, but a couple of months ago I realized how much of a nerd I was and how much I have wasted my life up till this point.  And I decided I would change it.A, B, and me are in a 3-person class at my school studying a very difficult subject.  The class has halved in size since the beginning of last year.  A and B had social lives, they enjoyed.  My only social life was in front of my computer reading Slashdot.  And it was just reading it - not actually posting stuff.  At the end of last term, I realized how much I had wasted my life and wanted it to change.  I will suffice to say that my exploits with the ladies have not been very successful in the past.  But through a couple of phone calls I found me a date for the school formal in a couple of weeks time.  I'll call her C.We have dated once, the Friday before the Saturday on which the drinking occurred.  We saw a movie, and talked.  I was amazed at how nice she was, and how incredibly beautiful.  And she was taking me to the formal!  I should be happy...Well I was happy about that.But other than this, little has happened to change my no-social-life problem.  A and B are my only real friends at school, and I only have one friend outside of school, it was him who introduced me to C.Other than this, not much has happened to improve my social-life situation.  I have been pressing A and B to find parties for me to go to with them, but so far have not been to any.  They have both been going to parties, but their reasons for not telling me about it are different every time.  In this past week, I have wondered if they actually care about helping me to get a social life like they say they do.I am aware that this probably sounds like its going nowhere, but I’m almost getting to the problems that I think the alcohol caused.  Just keep reading for few couple more paragraphs.A has sex on a regular basis - he knows a hot girl, and she comes over to his house almost every day...He also uses illicit substances such as LSD, ecstasy, DMT, cannabis, etc.  He enjoys his life.Now, the past week.Over the past week, I have been hugely depressed.  As in, I don't want to go to school to do my exams, not even for the difficult class (which I get very good marks for).  OK, bad example.I came home at night, and sit in front of my computer.  In the past I would have browsed Slashdot, but now I just sit here, thinking and feeling like shit.  Wishing I had a social life.  Wishing I  knew my 'friends' at school a little better.  Wishing I could be slightly more relaxed while talking to C.  Wishing I had started on the social life thing a year or so earlier.Basically, I feel like shit.  Especially in the evenings.  I don't feel like doing anything except sitting in front of my computer and hating my life.Today I thought it was over, but I realized at about 5pm that in fact it was not.  I was hating my life as much as ever.  I was wishing I was at a party somewhere, instead of in front of this computer.I have given this a lot of thought, and I believe it is the fault of the alcohol.  There are a lot of things that might be involved here...there's all the stress and worry about doing exams that are important for the rest of my life.  But, now the exams are over, and I'm more depressed than ever.  And also I had exams for Thursday and Friday of the week before that Saturday.Still, there's the formal to look forward to.  But after that? I don't know.  I hope, I really hope, that I can improve on my social standing after that.  I hate being depressed.  I want to go to parties with A and B, and I want to enjoy my life. T+0:00 Baseline, I first buy the quarter roll it up into three separate blunts to be ingested by me and three buddies. We each ingest 5mg of percocet generic brand, (endo 602) scored. We decide to drink to speed up effects. T+0:30 Each ingested two beers, slight effects started to be noted, world is slightly wobbly and primary colors distorted. First blunt smoked affects instantaneous. T+1:00 Feeling quite good, most oxy's make beer taste like water, this is none different, we take out beer bong, each bong 4 beers. T+1:30 Other two blunts are smoked, and another 5mg of percocet ingested. Real effects are starting to come, body no longer feels there, swaying is inevitable. T+2:00 World is out of perception, unable to keep eyes open, feeling of sea sickness and waves crashing upon body. T+3:00 Vomiting is induced, and night is finished, very bad idea for me to combine such drugs, should've stayed with just two. Amazing experience. I am in charge of the night operations of a small bank in a small state, and as such work the graveyard shift in a brightly lit, climate controlled room, by myself. This in and of itself is not so bad. The problem is that I come home from work at 7:30 in the morning and tend to want to indulge in the same indulgences in which I indulged when I was working during the day. In other words, I get pissed drunk before going to bed like I used to, but because of the time of day, I don't go to bed. I'll stay up for hours and days at a time, because I get too fucked up to feel like sleeping. I might get a little tired, but I have a few more drinks and smoke a bowl or two and no longer care too much. Seven PM or so rolls around and I really feel kind of tired, but at that point I'm so drunk that I don't think it's worth it to get a little nap before I go to work. I might sleep for a little bit at work, during down-time, but I hardly get any rest at all. I mean, think about that for a second... People who work normal daytime shifts might get shit-faced when they go home at night, and might only get three hours of sleep before going to work, but at least they do sleep a little. But a person working the third shift has a million reasons to not sleep during the day... I hardly ever do. I get drunk and start cleaning up the house or recording music or writing poetry or, hell, just jerking off or whatever. It just hardly ever seems like the middle of the afternoon is a good time to sleep, I guess.I worry about myself sometimes. I really believe that I still drink for the fun of it, just because I like being drunk. I don't yet consider myself an alcoholic. But I do notice that when I drink, as I have today, I am less likely to get the rest I need to function properly at work 'the next day'. I do my job perfectly well, but I only get away with showing up half asleep because I'm in the building all by myself. Part of me wonders whether I would get fired for being a substance abuser if I worked under tighter supervision, like during the day. I was quite anxious to try Sceletium tortuosum but my local herb-supplier recommended it so I bought a gram of Sceletium tortuosum in powder-form. I decided to take the snuff to a house party where my freinds also wanted to experiment with the drug, I decided to snort a line before drinking just incase alcohol duds the effects and felt a mild high, like that of cannabis but I felt more in control of myself. I then went on to have a few bottles of wifebeater(stella), which turned into a few more!(6 or 7) I then snorted a few more lines and was starting to act hyperactive and felt senses of euthoria-kind of like the effects from cocaine! I then went on to have a nice fat joint of cannabis. By this time I was feeling great and the Sceletium tortuosum seemed to inhance the other drugs effects. I went well on into the night and didnt notice any side-effects. I did wake up with a big hangover but im pretty sure that was because of the alcohol! I had tried to get drunk before the previous year on New Year's Eve by drinking wine but nothing happened. The next year I was determined to get drunk as hell. I had to know what it was like.So I got a 375ml bottle of 40% Vodka (well my mother did, I was 16 at the time) and set myself to drinking it. I sat down and started playing some video games, sipping the vodka while I played. My mother suggested mixing it with orange juice but I just wanted to drink it straight. The taste was pretty horrible, but not as bad as the some of the beer I had tasted previously. Little did I know that the taste and even smell of vodka would make me nauseous afterwards.I got up from the couch and noticed there was a lag in my vision, like my brain wasn't acting fast enough for my eyes. I walked slowly to the kitchen and my mother asked me how I felt. 'Fine', I said. I started to laugh at nothing and thought this must've been what beind drunk was like.It was all downhill from there.I went back to the living room and started feeling nauseous. I closed my eyes and lay down on the couch. Supper was ready so my mother brought it in. Pizza. I didn't want to open my eyes because the room was spinning so I decided to eat with my eyes closed.After having a few bites of the homemade pizza, I felt like puking so I stumbled to the bathroom sat down next to the toilet. My eyes were still closed when I vomitted up the pizza and had to lay my head down on the toilet because of the nausea. I stayed in that position for probably 20 minutes before deciding to go back to the living room. I got on all fours and crawled down the hall. It's about 10 feet from bathroom to living room. At the entrance I started puking again and couldn't move anymore. My mother got me a pillow and I lay on the floor. With my head on the pillow I began retching because my stomach was empty. At this point (8pm) I passed out and woke up at 3am. I lay on the floor for 10 minutes trying to get up so I could brush my teeth and change.I finally got up slowly and carefully walked to the bathroom and then up the stairs to my bed.The next morning I woke up to an extremely sore throat and my heart beating like I had just sprinted somewhere. I felt extrememly dehydridated and asked my mom for a glass of juice. I sat up in bed and drank it slowly. I threw it up 5 minutes later into the can next to my bed.For four days afterwards I had extremely painful headaches (I never, ever have headaches) and a very sore throat. I swore to myself that I would never get drunk again. I'm a teenager so of course I broke my promise but I've yet to even touch any kind of hard alcohol. The vodka bottle is still in my kitchen cupboard and just looking at it now makes me feel sick. Twas the night of my friend's bar mitzvah and all was well. The party kind of sucked, and I was getting very bored. So I got my friend to ask his sister to go to the open bar and get me some coke and Jack Daniel's. It tasted like shit, but I still wanted to have some fun. I got a beer, and 1 and a half more glasses of coke and Jack Daniels. My friend, who hadn't etaen all day and had had about 2 glasses and started noting his drunken feeling. I myself had never been drunk(very inexperienced drug user, I only smoke some pot, and only once did I experiment with cough syrup), and didn't know what to expect. A couple minutes after my friend said he was drunk, the music shifted. It wasn't like a drastic envelopement of the sounds and beats, but the song sounded different. It sounded better. I got up to talk to my friends, feeling very social. I laughed, danced, and joked. The night certainly had gotten better. I went back to my friend's house were I was entertained by some movies.the next morning I woke up with a slight head ache, but it didnt ruin my day(my friend who first noted he was drunk felt like SHIATE! the next day). Alcohol wasn't that great, I guess I didn't drink enough since I didnt have that great a buzz, didnt have a big hang over, and could remember the night before. This wasnt exactly an experience.It was a dream I had while sleeping which I think was manifested by my alcohol consumption. It was a couple of weeks ago when I had drank approx. 6 shots of whiskey. I am a chronic insomniac so I thought getting totally drunk every night would help me sleep better,well I was right and wrong.Another problem of mine is emotional frailty,this whole report is based of one single girl, everything in my life is.Anyhow, I have been totally in love with this girl for about 2 years and about 4 months ago I had seen 'A' as I will call her at the county fair.After I had seen her she was all I could think about day and all night,we went and talked for about twenty minutes with her friends and even though sober,this was very euphoric for me.So now back to my expericence,it was like any other school night I was gettin happy on the whiskey as I would alwayz do,pretty good buzz,happiness the usual.I began drinking about 8:45 pm,the average time for me to start my nightly drinking binge,nothing out of the ordinary,good buzz smoked a dozen cigarettes and layed down for the night.Now I am sleeping in my bed without a care in the world hating the fact that I have to wake up and go to school tomorrow,agian nothing usual. I have no perception of when and why the dream occured but I believe it to be alcohol based. I wake up and recollect of the dream while smoking my morning cigarette and listeing to my internet music files.WOW! I had a dream of 'A'.We were in town at lunch and in my dream I was totally feeling the effects of alcohol,but it was better than drunk,I was talking kindly to everyone,even people I hated.I was having deep and meaningful conversations with my enimies and I felt more love for them than my girlfriend.I saw 'A' outside the carry out I usually hang out at.She was stnading there and I walked up to her and I said 'A' you are so pretty,'A' had a shocked look on her face and oh my god,Her face was prettier,clearer,and more beautiful than anything I have ever seen.Her big brown eyes were so soft and warm,Her nose and lips were so sexy.Naturally I am preverted and when I see her I say to myself I wanna fuck her.This time in my dream was different becuase it was pure understanding,love,peace,tranquility,epiphany,euphoria,a new perspective of the world.I preceded to give her a peck on the lips and she just smiled at me,her sexy smile lit up my world!These words cannot even cover the tip of the ice berg of what I felt for 'A'.It wans't lust or sex that felt for her,It was love,compassion ,understanding,sympathy.These feelings where nothing else but pure.I'm not sure if my dream experience means anything or everything but it sure relived my depression and gave me a new outlook on everything.Its amazing on how only alcohol can change my perspective on life! These all went great together.  It's like being really high and really drunk (well duh, you think).  I had waves of that good-times feeling, so intensely that I'd clench my teeth and push my head back.  My voice sounded like someone else's, and the things I said were coherent but very enthusiastic and random.  I experienced something like pervasive time traveling: I'd know what I was going to think or say a second ahead of time; I was so dissociated it was like observing myself being stoned.  I thought I should share this experience because these are all substances that don't have to be bought from shady dealers behind an alley.  Though I still want to try other drugs, I'm positive my experience was on the same plane as crack or speed.  The whole thing left me feeling somewhat drained the next day though; no hangover, just unmotivated and a little depressed. I had just finished the MCAT and was in need of some experimenting. I was greeted by two bottles of champaign outside of the test and in short order was rather wasted. The second bottle was finished (with a little help from friends) around 5:15pm. Drinking continued over dinner and until around 8pm.I then ran into a friend who had wanted to try kratom, as I had just ordered some online, and we had been waiting to try it.I put 1g 'super resin extract' and 2g '2X leaf extract' into 300mL of water and a splash of lemon juice (for good measure, I hear its always better to make things like this acidic) in a double boiler and cooked it until the resin extract disolved, it took some crushing under a spoon.I filtered the concoction with a coffee filter, added some honey for flavor, and went off to find my friend.He had started drinking and didn't want to take it after drinking (he didn't tell me why, but I knew that drinking all of this would be a high dose, I believe that this is a lot more dangerous than how it turned out, everyone's body is different).I ended up drinking almost all of it (not wanting to waste my tea). It didn't taste very bad at all, just like some shitty cheap tea, not too bitter.The onset began before I finished drinking it (it took me about 15 minutes to finish). I had continued to drink through all of this, and continued to after the trip began.3 dimentions seemed clearer, my hand would glow as I waved it in front of me. I also felt very clear-headed and could very much hold a conversation, probably better than I could sober. I felt very awake as well. I was very interested in conversations with people, and ended up talking until 3am with a friend about everything.Sleep was uncomfortable, but I woke up without any sort of hangover (even from the drinking).After talking with people about this experience, I realize that it was probably dangerous to try this with alcohol, and I probably wouldn't again as I don't know how strong the resin extract was. I had a very good time and have bought more from the same place, but will not mix it with alcohol again. Ohh so crazy. Yeah so crazy. Combining that much with a bottle of whiskey is equal to commiting suicide. I did this not because I didn't know this I knew this well but I did this because I just wanted to DO.I was alone in France. (I live in Turkey but I went a vacation to France) I was so bored because I dont know French and I can not commucinate well with French girls even I speak superior English :).  This made me drink everyday and I brought 50 - 1mg Xanax tabs with me because I was depressed sometime a few months ago and the doc prescribed them.I saved some of the tabs and wanted to combine them with alc. just to see the effects. I started drinking whiskey and when I came to the half of the bottle I popped 8 tabs of Xanax at once (the side effects didnt even come to my mind). Then after 1 hr I started to feel ultra Euphoric. I was light and heavy at the same time.I laid to the carpets and started to roll. I was eating the carpets. My friends said that I was saying very strange things at the same time and laughing. I can't remember the experience very much because I was blacked out by combinining that much benzodiazepine w/ alc. They took me to billiards then to a bar to dirnk a coke. But I can only remember 2-3 scenes of these places. I was totally blacked out. They said that I went to bed at 2 o'clock and I woke up at 15. Whooa.! I slept for 13 hours not waking even once.! When I woke up I was totally dehydrated and I wanted to urinate. I would nearly explode. I urinated for a minute and then drank a great amount of water (3 lt) in 10 minutes. Then I went to bed and slept for another 5 hours. When I woke I felt like a giant rock had fallen on my head. It was 20:00 and all my day was wasted by sleeping. I was so sad.So in conclusion I can say that I can only remember the start of the experience (40-50 min) being ultra euphoric but the rest is blacked out. after looking at this site, I noticed that at the golf course where I work there are a large number of coleus plants. Interested b ythe possible effects of the plant I picked a few leaves and stuffed them in my pocket. When I arrived home me and my room mate began an ordinary night of binge drinking. To fully understand this experience a little back ground is needed. We regularly drink heavily 3 nights a week, so we have pretty strong alcohol tolerances and know quite well how it effects us. I'd estimate that we each had between 13 and 16 standard servings of alcohol when I remembered about the coleus. Having experimented with Salvia D. I was excited to try this. Moments after smoking it (in the same fashion one would smoke salvia) we became extremely sedate. For about the next hour, we just sat in my room without television, music, anything. neither of us ot up to get food or move or anyhting. just before smoking it I had made a bowl of mr. noodle which ended up sitting on my desk for the entirety of the experience. The oddest part was that neither of us encouraged the other to drink nor did we get a fresh drink ourselves. This is the oddest part to us cause we never considered it whereas we usually drink each otehr into submission. A day or two after we decided to try the plant sober. This time I oven dried the leaves and smoked several. very little difference was noticed this time. If anything it might have been a slight placebo effect. I'm going to try further experimenting since I have suggested trying it to a couple people some of which reported similar experiences. I'm interested in researching more and finding out if there is any good potential. I've been drinking heavily since I was around 13 with exception of 2 years in high school, when I quit. So it's been about a decade since then. According to the contemporary medical community I'm an alcoholic, though a functional one. I'm also an honors student at a major university who hasn't missed more than one or two classes in the last three years. I've gone through a 30 pack of beer or a bottle of bourbon in a day and remain relatively sober. I've quit drinking on an almost weekly basis for the last year. Hangovers from drinking as much as I do are especially nasty and result in headaches and mild shaking, and coughing up bile, which I've often drank through (40oz's or MD 20/20 get rid of hangovers fast). Drinking is like a love affair. When it's great, it's amazing and when it's not it's terrible. Blackouts are the personal scourge of my being though. I've cut down recently after I got the shakes after a week-long drinking binge over the summer. But, of course there's the reason I drink - it feels great if I can stop at a buzz and not get full on drunk. It's harder for some of us to stop though. It helps to know if I'm one of those people. Me and most of my family are. But I'm not some puritan. OK if I would have known what we were about to get into I would have been a little bit more cautious about how much I drank.OK here goes, it was 5 of us in a small car and we were looking for alcohol. We tried to purchase it at about 5 convenience stores but all wanted an id that we didn't have. So someone comes up with the idea that we should break into a hunters club cabin in the backwoods. We drove into the sticks of Pennsylvania and walked for about a half hour before we found the cabin we were looking for. We broke in and took many bottles of assorted alcohol (vodka Bacardi tequila). We drove to my friends house (no parents) and began to mix vodka with orange juice in big cups. I proceeded to have about 3 cups of 50/50 vodka and orange juice. I began to not be able to walk barely at all, but somehow we managed to start mixing Bacardi 151 and orange juice. I had about 2 cups of that and went to go chill outside on the deck. I was pretty calm, even when my friend A.J. pulled a pistol on me, when he was intoxicated also. I laid on the cool concrete with my brother and my other friend.The place where we were staying at had a large blue water tower in the yard right next to ours. The last thing I remember is looking up at that water tower and feeling tranquil and a little bit giggly. I was unaware of anyone else or anything else but the water tower. The water tower looked like a giant UFO hovering above us, my friends also had their own renditions of what they visualized it as.I blacked out. I don't know what I was doing but I wasn't conscious of anything at all and I have no recollection of what happened in the next three hours.The next memory I had was cleaning up barf that I didn't believe was mine. I believed my brother had tricked me into cleaning his own barf... I had a severe hangover for 2 days and felt sickest I’ve ever been. I will never be able to drink vodka again, and the faintest smell of it makes me nauseated. I learned my lesson, not to drink the hard stuff!! I was reading about nutmeg usage on the net, and said, 'hey, I have nutmeg' and so I ate about 20 grams or so of it. Probably a bit less. I didn't measure (stupid I know). Anyhoo, I ate it around 8 pm, and by 9 I was starting to feel the effects. Nothing fancy, just relaxed... real cool man. A friend called me up and offered me a ride to go to a bar, listen to some old tunes with his buddies.So I walked a half hour walk, at about 9:45-10:00 to the University where he was gonna meet me. It was dark, and the way to the University is dark and through a trail in the forest. This is where I started to feel mild hallucinogenic effects. I had some decent trippin' music on my discman, Tool's 'Aenima' album, lots of texture. I heard alot more than I usually do. Alot of subtle reverb and echo effects made it through to me...guitar lines and stuff I haven't heard. The trees on the sides of the path were changing from black to grey then to a nice wintery white, which was strange but somehow comforting. I kept wondering if it was the nutmeg or the 'placebo' effect, but I'm sure now that it was the nutmeg's hallucinogenic effects kicking in. I was having a bit of trouble focusing on one spot while in motion. That's usually the sign for me, that I'm feelin' chemical effects.So I made it to the university about 45 minutes early, at about 10:20 pm. I sat on the bleachers in the deserted track stadium. I bought a sprite because my mouth was damn dry, and I had forgotten my water. I ended up sitting there looking at the streetlamps across the way, amazed at the way the halo effect around the lights could dilute and expand and contract and dissolve and I tried to control it (don't remember if I could). I switched CD's to Jimi Hendrix, and listened to 'Are You Experienced?' again and again. An excellent song, again I heard stuff that probably wasn't there. So eventually I was in my friends car, off to a scuzzy bar. I was completely coherent, probably overly so. I more clearly than I usually do. I didn't tell them I was on nutmeg, just didn't feel right. We got to the bar, and his friends made me buy a round as soon as I sat down. I was then introduced. We drank and sang along to the music, and I was pretty bored. I drank 3 beer, 1 rye & ginger, and then the guys wanted me to drink 4 shots of tequila. blech. I wasn't drunk enough for that, but I got through two. The second one almost made me hurl.By 1:30 am, we were on are way home. I was feeling more drunk than anything else, the alcohol had seen the nutmeg in my system and said 'this is an alcohol town' and so the nutmeg took off to hide somewhere, until I pissed the alcohol away.9:00 am class the next day. Woke up at 7:30 hung over, but it only lasted about an hour. I biked to school, and sat down for 2 1/2 hours of blah blah blah. I was a bit wobbly, nothing noticeable though. I was talkative, but had trouble reading. I had a significantly lowered attention span, even for me. I had a pretty good morning, I felt just kind of stoned... spaced out like. It was nice. Effects wore off by about 6pm that night, except for being a tiny bit spaced out. The only negative effects I experienced were suicidal thoughts while on the bleachers, about 2 1/2 hours in. This isn't anything new for me, as I suffer from clinical depression. Luckily I know how to control those urges, and they weren't much stronger than the urges I feel on a regular basis. Other drugs I've taken are worse. Acid brought me closer to the edge, granted I first took it was when I was more chemically inexperienced. Alcohol can also cause more problems for me than nutmeg did. I suppose its a bad idea to use any mind-altering drugs when depressed, so be careful. Consult your doctor (haha :).Overall, it was a truly pleasurable experience, and I'll probably do it again. It was my friend's birthday party and he had a bunch of people over, at first we were all just sittin' around smokin' splifs and drinking. I was with my bro', Oskar and we were shooting whiskey and drinking our 40's, just chillin' and smokin'. At about 11 p.m. we were extremely crunk (chronically-drunk) and we realized that we still had a couple of hits of acid that we'd picked up earlier that day. We dosed together out of his front porch while enjoying our cigarettes. About 40 minutes later we both started to feel it kicking it, i became aware of my muscles and they left strained but it was pleasurable. We also couldn’t stop smiling, it was like our faces were suspended in a permanent smile, we looked like morons.A little after I was takin' a piss and smoking at the same time when I saw something near the cherry of my cigarette. I don't know how I came to this but I decided my rig had aids so I yelled and tossed it in the toilet and flushed it. I had no idea at this point where my brother was. A few minutes later, after smoking another splif, my armpit started to feel itchy, so I went to look at it in the bathroom mirror. I saw red worms crawling around the hair under my arm so I started yelling and clawing at my armpit. My bro' fell into the bathroom and asked me what was happening. I told him my armpit had aids and he started getting really worried like he believed me. Seconds later a sober girl who was there assured me that nothing was wrong with my armpit.We then went into our friend's living room which has this flower wallpaper. Oskar lay on the floor and started staring at it while having a rig, a couple of other people were in the room listening to some music and drinking. The room was quite smoky and as I sat next to Oskar I began to see little green things floating in the air. They looked like germs so I told him, and he replied that he didn’t see anyone. Then he took a deep breath and I saw him inhale the germs that were quite thick in the air. I started trippin' hard and yelling about the germs and how we're all infected. Eventually people calmed me down and I decided to go to dunkin' donuts with Oskar. I ordered a turkey sandwich and a coffee, he had no money so he didn’t get anything. Halfway through my sandwich I thought it too had aids so I yelled and ran to the bathroom to rinse my mouth out while Oskar ate the sandwich.By the time we got back to our friend's house it was about 4:30 am and we were almost down. At about 6 am we were the only ones up having coffee that we made and having rigs, reminiscing of our trip that ended just hours ago. The point of the whole thing is, before that night, neither of us had done anything but hash, pot and alcohol. That night was the turning point in our lives that turned us into drug users and opened our eyes to the fact that where was a completely different world, an alternate dimension and it was over-all very pleasurable and enlightening...do acid! Peace After work I decided to mix some cannabis with some damiana. I really just did this because I didn't want to get too stoned, but I needed some filler for the cigarette. I had originaly bought the damiana along with some skullcap which I make a tea out of (very relaxing).The smoke of the damiana was harsh compared to the cannabis. I could taste each seperately and feel each seperately in my lungs, and the damiana had a distinct 'tea' taste that burned my throat. The effects seemed to hit me both harder and weaker in different ways than just cannabis normally would. I seemed a little more mentally stoned than normal, and less of a body buzz. I noticed my neck muscles were tight, but I passed it off as an effect from work earlier. Later in the night I rolled up a mixture of cannabis, damiana, and skullcap in three equal amounts. After a few beers at a party, I had a nice little buzz going. I decided to smoke the joint mixture with another friend. The smoke was still harsh somewhat, but considering I had more cannabis it was more tolerable than earlier. The taste of the skullcap also seemed to dominate the damiana (not a bad thing). This time the effects hit me a lot harder, which could largely be attributed to the alcohol that was also in my system... but in my experience that small of an amount of alcohol usually won't effect a cannbis high as greatly as it did. The mental effects were definetly heightened. I felt on the verge of anxiety if I didn't occupy my mind with something. Mentally, it was almost similar to the onset of a trip... I could hear the overpowering effect of everyone's conversations at once. I got into a 'thought loop' about why the mental effects were so strong while the physical effects were still almost unapparent. When I say physical effects, I mean the nice, warm, buzzing sensation associated with a cannabis high. There were physical effects that came on... more of the uncomfortable tightness in my neck, and my back and shoulder muscles felt cramped. It was very uncomfortable, and almost to the point where I regretted smoking it in the first place. Eventually these effects went away (after I consumed more alcohol, which may have contributed to the loosening/relaxing of my muscles).Although I haven't tried the skullcap alone or with cannabis by themselves, I'd still attribute the negative physical effects to the damiana. Not only did it happen twice in one day, it also was amplified when I smoked more of it. Overall, I recommend just sticking with the marijuana for smoking, and leave the damiana and skullcap for making tea. I have done DXM so many times i can barely even guess how many times i have done it. A 'normal' dose was anywhere between 750-900. Pretty stong doses. I would do it anywhere between 1-5 times a week. A few times, i went on DXM binges lasting about a week. These were real mind benders. It was the end of a week long binge and i was invited to a family party by one of my good friends. In fact, the whole gang was going, four of us in total. I picked up one of my friends on the way to the party. We stopped by a local stop and shop and i got a box of corcedin cough and cold, as well as an 8 oz. bottle of tussin maximum strength. My friend got two boxes of corcedin. We arrived at the party around six'ish and my friend's dad offered us beer and took our car keys. We looked around at each other and decided we might as well try mixing DXM and alcohol, even though it's strictly not recomended. So we each drank some beer, and one of my friends and i went upstairs to 1) take some DXM and 2) get this wireless microphone FM transmitter to work (you know, the little microphones you talk into and it comes through your FM radio). Anyway, we each took 16 pills (480 milligrams) just to start things off.The other two came upstairs and brought us down stairs. by this time i was just feeling a very mild buzz from the beers. We went down stairs and ate (i think?) and we were just waiting for things to get started. The friend that i had taken DXM with already, we were starting to feel spacy, that sort of opium feeling, of tingling, warmth, and whatnot. As we were all drinking a little more, the alcohol seemed to put all the DXM into our bloodstreams a little faster. In fact, it seemed to put it in all at one. I remember starting to feel retarded and losing my co-ordination. Then it hit me, and i decided to go drink the robo. 8 oz. later (720 mg) and i had a total of 1200 mg in me. There was only about an hour in between taking the pills and the robo. i knew i was in for it. Somehow i ended up with another 8 corcedin pills (240 mg) in my pocket and i took those, but i have no recollection of when. So there i was, with 1440 mg of DXM in me. An amount i had only taken once before, and a few beers speeding up the absorbtion of DXM. From here on in, i lost communication skills, well.. i didnt really lose them, it was just damn hard to say a sentence. And when i did, i would end up using this ridiculus accent (like a young british girl's)??? I was crazy. There were adults all around that had no idea that i was on DXM until one of my friends told them. They just thought i was really drunk. I remember walking past a few adults one time. I had to go from outside to the inside through the garage, and the adults were sitting inside the garage. So i had to put aside the hallucinations for a while and walk past them. So i began... Oh crap, i cant fell my feet, or even ANY part of my body. I had no equilibrium, and no body. I dont know how i did it but i managed to want all the way to the door and open it but i did a sort of drunken walk like that in Fear in Loathing in Las Vegas ( the ether scene). They tried to speak to me but thier voices were like a fan, just a rumbling that i could make no clear words out of. I managed to find my friends and then that's when the shit hit the fan. We went outside only to see an inflatable house. You know the kind they have at fairs and whatnot. The kind where you can bounce off the walls, floor, ceiling, and not get hurt. I think its called the moonwalk. This was hell. We bucked the door and were now in a space of little to no gravity. It was dark out so by this point, i had almost no external stimulus coming in. I would close my eyes and jump and let my body go. While in mid air, i felt as if i was floating in space, nothing touching me and then WHAM!!! I got nailed by the floor only to bounce again and return to the space and WHAM!!! back to the floor. back to space. back to the floor...and with each bounce, the time got quicker and quicker. It was like a countdown to the end. After about four hours in there, i finally got control of my thoughts back so i began the sobering up process. I just drank lots of fluids and let my self relax because i knew there was going to be no sleep for the next 14 hours. It was 4 in the morning and we moved back inside. Everyone got to sleeping and i was just sitting there in a sofa chair. I was reading the guiness book of world records. Then the most bizarre halucination i have ever expierenced (wheather on DXM, PCP, LSD ...) I look over to the bathroom because i heard a noise. I looked over to see my friend with his blanket wrapped around him and he pointed up. I thought he meant that he wanted to move upstairs and sleep in a bed, so i gave him a thumbs up to signify that that would be cool. So as i was turning around to get up to go upstairs, i briefly look over to the sofa and there was my friend who was just pointing upstairs, lying on the couch,SLEEPING. I quickly looked back to see if the other one was still there but there was nothing. I looked back to the couch and he was still there. I was terrified and i had know idea what just happened. I went to the bathroom and put water on my face. I then went back to the sofa chair and relaxed, not at all sleepy jus watching the fan blades grow and shrink, watching the fireplace bend and grow. Eventually these events stopped and i finally came back to normalcy around 6 am. I was back to normal me, felling good about the long, strange, powerful trip i just had and i fell it was all positive. Alcohol seems to rush the DXM into your system and then the trip lasts a shorter time. It concentrates the trip. I have done DXM with alcohol about 3 times, with similar results.I have expierenced no ill side effects, except the occasional sugar imbalence ( robo is a mix that contains high amounts of sucrose and fructose which dramatically increase your blood sugar. Tis can lead to a diebetic type high, or lead to a diebetic type low, characterized by shakiness, upset stomach, sweating, paleness...)That only happens when you take a lot of robo in a short amount of time on an empty stomach. There have been no permanent mental side effects. No permanent emotional side effects, and as a side note, it doesn't even affect sport performance. I have gone to play a basketball game on robo. That was an interesting game! I feel DXM is benificial as long as you know where, when, and how to properly do this dissasociative drug.Happy Trippin' -- My friend and I decided to venture into a concauction of realtively odd substances.  It started with two 200mg caffeine pills ingested, followed by a beer bong.  Five minutes later we smoked .25mg of clonezapam, then we snorted .25mg of clonezapam.  We then proceeded to take another beer bong, followed by a cup of tension tamer tea with extra kava.  After consuming the potpourri of substances we smoked two cigarettes to complete are intake.  This resulted in a very mellow, yet very satisfying buzz.  A good combination to take if you want to get a sedated feeling, without losing alertness.  We noticed a slight unsettling feeling in our stomachs due to the alcohol.  A very nasty tasting burp relieved this disturbance, but was cleared up with a glass of water.  No psychodelic activities occured, but then again our mix of substances was only supposed to give us a relaxing buzz, so the effects we seeked were obtained rather nicely.  This combination served us well as far as taking away the stresses of daily life.  I noticed a slight numbing feeling, which reminded me of Pink Floyd's 'Comfortably Numb,' so that's exactely what we listened to. Excellent choice for both substances and musical satisfaction.  If you're looking for a chill buzz, this is a perfect combo.  All substances were taking within a few minutes of each other, so the different effects hit us at once to brew up this mellow and relaxing buzz.  The only down side was that sleep was a little hard to reach, because of the caffeine pills, but another cup of kava tea set me straight as the warm liquid calmed my nerves and put me into sleepy state as I nicely passed out after a few hours of relaxation. Me and my friend B were at his house and his mom was at work as usual.  She had tons of Rx med bottles in her dresser and since I had the more knowledgable brain on what it is that can and can not 'fuck you up', I searched through it with his consent.  There wasn't much of anything useful.  I almost gave up among the thirty or so Rx labels until I noticed a famililar name; Klonopin.  Immediately, I grabbed the bottle, ran to the computer and searched it.  Most results showed phrases containing the word xanax so I immediately assumed it was a generic version of xanax.  (I now know that I was wrong and that though it is similar to Alprazolam, it is not the same drug.)  The pills expired in '96 (this took place in May of 2003)  The pills were 1mg each, blue and dusty from old age.  I decided to take one at first, then after a few minutes, I believe I took 1 or 2 more.  After B had consumed some, we decided we'd venture off with my car to the cemetery.  This is where my memory, before and after all this gets fuzzy to completely GONE.  The effects seemed sililar to hydrocodone, but remarkabley different and less apparent.  I danced around the mausoleum with my accoustic before deciding to take more...about 3 or 4 more.  My reasoning was this:  Maybe the years of sitting in that drawer had caused the chemical to begin breaking down.  Though I don't think this reasoning would have taken place had I not already consumed 3-4mg of it already.  We must have decided to get alcohol because the police report states there was alcohol found in the trunk of my car.  Police report?  Yea, I'll get to that.  I have this images in my mind of being in B's brother's room and finding alcohol in his small refrigerator.  The order of the events you are about to read are unknown, and neither is the validity.  My brother, R, was also in the car and had consumed a small amount of the clonasepam as well.  He was in the backseat.  There is a small park near B's house that we must have driven to at some point after the cemetery.  We allegedly drank there.  With a BAC of .058 and being 145, I must have consumed about a beer and a half to two beers.  I then was told by my brother that I was driving on the bike path at a supposedly high speed.  It was then, that I hit a tree...hard.  (my car no longer starts..possibly totaled)  My brother got out of the car...unknown to me (again, i can recall very little of this).  I drove off about 20 seconds after hitting the tree and just as the police reached the seen.  Apparently, my driving on the bike path was previously and immediately reported.  I then drove off down the road, and must have taken a left onto PG road where my car was found in the middle of an intersection...both me and B, in the front seat, blood everywhere, passed out.  I remember saying to a police officer after being asked about the blood 'I have chapped lips'  We were then taken to the hospital...can't remember...I was released into police custody and taken to the station..can't remember.  All I remember is seeing the pills near the cop and hoping he'd leave just for a moment and wanting to steal them.  Apparently I said something offensive cause I remember the cop getting nasty with me and saying, Hey, you're lucky I'm releasing you on this 20,000 dollar I bond.  I then went home.  The next day...I do not remember this day except for a few images that I can recall...but as told by a friend:I walked to meet B at 7-11.  On the way, an old friend, Jack saw me.  He said, Hey J.  I stumbled to the car and allegedly said 'who the hell are you?'  Now, I know his face from a good 50 feet away so this is odd for me to hear, especially since I remember NONE of this.  He dropped me off and I assume I met B there.  From there we must have walked a ways to the police station where he said he needed to meet an officer.  We got there somehow and they said, which THIS I DO recall, you have to go to the rolling meadows police station.  I knew where that was and I remember my frame of mind.  We must have walked another long walk because somehow we ended up at Wendy's.  B had stolen his mom's cell phone (which he does not remember, along with this stange string of events) I was told, just today, that I talked to two of my friends, S and M on that phone in wendy's.  S described my tone (the day after taking the drugs, and the accident with no further dosing) as it being 'not me at all'.  I supposedly went on to say that the accident was all her fault and if she would have picked us up that fateful day, it would have never happened.  Thing is, she wasn't supposed to pick us up from anywhere that day and we hadn't even talked to her.  Where I got that from, I dunno.  B was later picked up from wendy's by his mom.  I remember her walking in and B leaving.  I was told by B from his mom that I walked the opposite way.  The walk from wendy's to my house is a loooooooong one.  Easily over 5 miles on busy roads.  The only way I could have made it home, was to walk.  I do not recall walking....at all.  That entire day is no more than the images of the police station and B's mom walking into wendy's for that brief second.  All memory immediately fades away before and after those images.  I now face an underage DUI, and two other tickets.  I'm pretty fucked...and scared as to what happened that day and the following day... I had taken Valum and Xanax every once and a while, usually when it was accessible.  For all those not aware, Xanax and the like are very easily obtainable in places like Latin America or South-East Asia.During this particular experience, I was with in Thailand.  I went out for a night with my father in a beach-front town, riding motorbikes and drinking beer.  Once my pops was preoccupied for a moment, I took off over to a pharmacy and bought an 8 tablet-package of 1 mg. Alprazolam.I took four, after having already consumed 3 12 oz beers.  I immediately picked up a 24 oz. beer for the ride.  Incidentally, this particular brand of beer, Chang, when purchased out there is anywhere between 7 and 14% alcohol by volume in a given bottle.  It's a gamble.  Alcohol definitely contributed to my experience.  I lost all memory after being on the motorbike for 20 minutes or so, but the onset was like any Xanax or Valum:  My head felt light, as did all my movements.  No deep pleasurable body highs like opiates.  I woke the next morning in my hotel room, naked from the waste down, a cigarette had burned into the bedding.  The room was a complete waste-the small fridge was open and various beverages and food items opened and scattered about.  It was clear that I had stumbled all over the room and was hungry before finally passing out.  As for my exposed bottom-half, there was no girl next to me when I woke so I would assume I came to my room alone.My dad rattled on the door a few minutes later telling me to get my shit together so we could get breakfast.  I had told him I must of had a bit too much to drink, because I didn't remember a thing.  He was shocked at the state of the room when I let him in, and he explained, laughing, that I had ordered a whole feast's worth of room service to his room for him and the girl he was with.That's not the first time myself or friends of mine have blacked out from the combination of Xanax and alcohol.  I have explicit footage of people doing and saying outrageous things while under the influence; showing them later drew forth no recollection.I guess my recommendation is first of all not to take as many as 4 while drinking- I can honestly say that the effects of 2 seem the same as 4 without drinking, so one wouldn't be missing much.  Also, it's probably best not to drink heavily on them.   I began the night by taking one Ambien with a few beers. My friend had given it to me stating that it was 'not your average sleeping pill'. I was rather eager to try it since I have always been a 'pill-lover'; however, I was not expecting a great deal from a sleeping pill. In less than fifteen minutes, I felt a bit of a body buzz and a physical and mental calmness. Unfortunately, it was very mild so I decided to ingest 2 more pills. My body relaxed and I became somewhat 'wobbly'. It was decisively different than an alcohol high. After 2 more pills and several beers, I was somewhat upbeat but had a very soothing body high. My vision became more binocular and impaired; it was difficult to maintain fixed concentration on anything concrete. Instead, my thoughts migrated to other things and I felt peaceful. Not euphoric, but calm. My attention to the environment and my judgement were clouded but my thought processes as a whole were more active. I cannot imagine why this is a sleeping pill, because I had trouble sleeping, as my mind was too busy thinking. How I got the stuff and from who is unimportant. But after hearing about meth and reading some reports here I finally worked up the courage to try some. I had a good (guy) friend of mine get it for me so I could not be 'caught in the act' of buying the stuff.Just another advantage of being female, (and pretty cute so im told). I scored the stuff on a thursday and I got quite a bit for the price is what my friend told me. I could not wait to try the stuff and because I had so much of it, I didnt want to do It alone. I invited another (girl)friend of mine, LORA (not her real name) that I knew had done it before, to share some with me on the approaching weekend.She told me what to expect and how to prepare. I asked questions, she answered them. She is a regular user of the stuff, but doesent look like the stereo-typical user you might see in a movie. She is actually very beautiful, and has worked before in strip clubs and escort agencies. The time came and it was friday afternoon, we were at her place because its close to the beach in San Clemente, and much more interesting than my place! She ordered 2 large pizzas and she said we HAD to stuff ourselves. This Is something id NEVER do, but I understood why because of the soon to come loss of appetite. So we did and drank lots of gatoraid to hydrate ourselves. Her living room is awesome and im glad we were there. It has bean bags, a big fur rug, a small round glass table, a big leather couch, and all sorts of neat lights. She told me many things to expect, increased heart rate, limitless energy, paranoia, but the best of all was the increased sexual desire to touch and be touched (even if we do it ourselves)Now you must understand she is very cute and BI-Sexual. Ive always known she is attracted to me, and the more I tought about it, the more nervous I became. We started drinking beer & smirnoff to relax a bit, and im glad we did because now my apprehensions about her (and my) sexuality practically dissappeared. Lora took my sack from me and prepared 6 lines on her table for us, and a small bowl of water. she did one first and showed me how to sniff the water through my nostrals, so as not to waste any. I did mine in one big inhale, My eyes began to immediatly water and there was the burning sensation in the back of my throat, but not at all unplesant after I sniffed the water. I immediatly wanted another and her and I finished all 6 (3 each) she lit a joint and handed it to me. I was feeling fantastic, within 15 minutes I could feel my heart rate increase and almost a tingeling sensation through my body, LORA returned wearing a very cute sweat top and some cute short sweat shorts. I really thought she was cute, but I did not feel the sexual desire she said I would. I told her this and she said it would take time, perhaps a few more hours. She told me If I wanted to change into something more comfy, to just go get something from her room. I was a bit uptight and agreed. I was amazed at her collection of sexy clothes. I was like a kid at a candy store, I probally rummaged for quite  a while, because She came into the room and I was trying on everything. She laughed a bit because she knew How FAST I was speeding. I just couldnt decide, so she picked out something similar to what she was wearing and gave it to me. We through on some cute flip-flops and decided to drive down to the beach. Both of us were talking 100miles an hour, laughing at each other, It was about 7 or 8 pm, and I swear we had a million guys hit on us, but then again, my mind was going about a mile a minute. We finally got to the san clemente beach/state park, where 'they say' is a nude beach, and we were determined to find it. When we got there the place was closed so we were screwed. We continplated sneaking in and skinny dipping in the ocean, but decided it was a bit NIPPLY outside. I loved this feeling. I told her how I was feeling and she suggested going back to her place and doing more. I agreed without question. We arrived and it was so warm in her place we opened the balcony door, and lit some candles. She told me to go in her room and get on the bed, so I grabbed a beer and did as I was told. I think that sexual feeling was starting to hit me because normaly I would have asked 'what for' But now, in my state-of-mind  I was happy to hear her speak such words! My insides were shaking, and I was unsure of wether it was from the drug/s  or the uncertainy of why she would demand such a think. She returned with a q-tip type piece of paper or something, and I remember trying to ask what it was for, before I got the words out she was kissing me and touching me in all the right places. I thought 'oh my god, this is what Ive been missing!'  what a fool Ive been not to have felt this before. and in an instant her fingers were inside of me and I cried out with a moan of pleasure. She told me, a bit inside would make me cumm like a mad woman possessed on sex! her fingers did not leave right away either, for which I was thankful, Hours upon hours of sex with her, in every position, in every room. I felt like a slut, and I loved every minute of it. Ive never expierenced another woman before and as far as im concerned, it will be me and her always! forget E! this stuff rocks. It has opened a door of sexuality in me I never knew I had. I am thankful for this drug and If I become hooked, I hope sex is always this good, because Ive spent hours masterbating alone, sometimes even in my car when Im driving. It is truly one amazing drug. LORA and I get together almost every weekend and have our sexual rituals amongst  her apartment. The come-down is not so nice, I feel hollow, and sometimes depressed, and usually always raw between my legs. But after a few hours (17-20) of sleep, I feel re-juvinated and ready for more! I cannot tell anyone not to do this drug, but do it responsibly - however that is! Please think about mixing any kind of drugs together because their effects can be very intense and undesirable.Last night me and my buddy were planning on going to a small rave just out of town. We had been drinking beer all day and at about 8 o'clock we started getting into some liqour. I was feeling pretty good and i was stoked on going to this party since i havnt been to a rave in almost a year.We got a ride out to the party by my friends girlfriend and arrived there about 10 pm. We went in and checked out the scene to find it was kind of dissapointing. The people there were not really my kind of people, they all seemed to be pretty out of it. And the girls were all kind of average looking. Alot of the girls that were there were girls i have been involved with in the past which made being there feel kind of awkward. When i got offered a tab of ecstacy i accepted it because i wanted something to highten the mood. Ive only done E once like 6 months ago and the last time i rolled i quite enjoyed it. So my buddy and I popped a pill and pretty much forgot aout it.A sort time later i started to feel really good and went dancing. One thing that really bothererd me though was that i really had a strong urge to talk to someone and it was very difficult due to the very loud music. I didn't let it bother me to bad because i took alot of outside breaks and talk to people out there. I found i was chain smoking and my pack which was full upon arrival was now getting low. After about 2 hours i felt as if my peak on the E was coming down as did the liqour and i was starting to feel kind of 'run down'. A doobie was being passed around and i took some tokes. I don't smoke pot much so it has a strong effect on me. After smoking the joint i forgot about it cause i have been smoking so many cigs and my short term memory seemed kind of scrambled.All of a sudden being in the rave i thought that everyone who was whispering into someones ear was talking about me and i was the center of attention at the rave. It was such intense paranoia i couldn't handle it. I just wanted to go home. It felt like i was losing my mind because the paranoia felt so real. I knew i was just tripping but the feelings were to intense to shake off. I just wanted to go home and curl up in my bed by this time. The E was losing its effect and i was crashing hard of all the liqour i was drinking. I felt opposite feelings that i had earlier, i didn't want anything to do with these people. I started having sinister thoughts and i was getting really negitive. I told my friend about the paranoia and he was like 'bro, its just the weed.' I remembered about the weed and that eased it cause i remembered that weed sometimes has an effect like that. I feel asleep in the car for a few hours and got home at 9 am feeling like shit. I slept all today and got up at 6 pm. The only thing that motivated me to get out of bed was the fact that dinner was ready. I still feel a little strange and i seriously doubt i will roll ever again. I hope that my experience can be somewhat useful to any one who reads this. I'd ordered some African Wild Dagga online a few months ago in my curiosity to try legal substances.  For the most part, I've concluded that legal substances are legal for one of two reason:  either the government hasn't deemed the substance enough of a risk to the public to schedule it or the government doesn't know enough about the substance to schedule it.  The former usually translates into 'this substance/plant won't do jack shit.'  There are exceptions, however, but for the most part I've found this to be true.  Until last night I placed the Wild Dagga into this category, having sampled it on many occasions without much fanfare. Some claim Wild Dagga to be a viable MJ substitute, citing mild MJ like effects.  After smoking the dagga three or four times I rationalized that everyone else's definition of mild differed greatly from mine.  I've smoked MJ on many many occasions and consider myself quite experienced with it--based on my experience,  Wild Dagga is no substitute, not even close.  Or so I thought...Last night, I drank about five beers over the course of five or so hours.  Before I smoked the dagga I was feeling a slight alcohol buzz, but nothing pronnounced.  In my boredom, I decided to smoke a few bowls of the still full bag of dagga I had laying around.  Initially I didn't feel a damn thing, just burning lungs from the harsh smoke.  However, after watching TV for about five minutes after I concluded smoking I realized I was a lot more intoxicated than I rightly should have been.  Colors were slightly brighter, time moved incredibly slowly (and really fast at the same time), and I was really into the 48hrs broadcast that was playing.  There was a definate dreamy quality to the evening thereafter as well as a 'haze' of sorts.  Music, however, didn't sound any better and the euphoria was minimal.  I was definately affected by something other than the alcohol.I can now see why this is claimed to be a MJ substitute.  While I felt nothing after smoking the dagga sober, it seemed to synergize well with the alcohol and the effects were indeed like MJ in some ways.  In other ways it was completely different.  I'd liken it to buying generic Coke (a-cola, that is) and the real thing and sampling both at the same time.  Yeah, the generic kinda tastes like Coke, but it just isn't the same.  So while I'd hesitate to call it a MJ substitute, it is a viable substance and handy to have around when there's nothing else.  With that said, it's just not the real thing. The night wasn't suposed to be this insane, it all started off very simply where a few friends and I were suposed to go to this rather small party. I was planning on taking one MDMA pill with my friend Jack, while the others who were with us would be drinking.  Jack and I were under the impression we had very powerful MDMA pills which we were very happy about, while we were being driven to the party Jack and I had popped one suposed MDMA each. Thus began what I like to call the never ending night.It was quite a long drive and I recall myself comming up in the car, I was getting visuals and a touch of euphoria which was suprising because I had never gotten visuals this early in a MDMA trip, which originally made me think that i was in possession of MDA (it was actually 5-meo-dipt pacman pills) which was still good news to me.  As the car drive continued I noticed the visuals getting stronger and the Euphoria lessening. The type of visuals i was recieving were vaguely interesting, I was watching the speedometer of the car and it seemed to be moving around in a circular motion.We finally arrived Jack and I were definately feeling something the only problem was we had no idea what.  I had slight stomach discomfort, but not nearly bad enough to ruin my time.  Our group consisted of Jack, his twin brother Neil, Chris and Daniel.  Everyone but Jack and I were planning on getting very drunk, Jack and I preferred the psychadelic experience. As we walked into the house we found out to our slight displeasure that we had crashed a private Birthday party that only Daniel was invited to.  But we decided to stay as unwelcome guests which is all fine and dandy for the drunks in our group, but for Jack and I who were tripping out quite badly it wasnt an enticing idea. I can best describe the experience as being very shy, kind of in a mushroom world but without the mindfuck, and maybe a little bit of euphoria.At this time Jack and I were feeling quite edgy so we decided to go outside for a walk and smoke some pot. And did that ever help,at this point Jack and I were certain that we were on a non-md substance.  We returned to the party only to walk outside again and keep smoking pot. At this point I produced my vial of rush, I inhaled the rush and passed it to Jack he did the same, and it felt like i was shot out of cannon and all of a sudden ripped back into reality, followed by the most insane maniacal laughing fit ever.We looked at each other and our faces had completely gone red, we were still chuckling. Although we both agreed that we were dissapointed in the e, we would try to make the most of our night.We ran inside to where the party was only to discover Neil and Chris drunk out of their minds, and Daniel fairly drunk as well. Where we introduced Rush to everyone. We took out the video recorder to record the experience, because it was everyone's first time inhaling rush.  At first only our group was willing to try and they were hesitant.  But after 4 consecutive laughing fits people were all fighting over that funny littl vial. It was perhaps one of the most interesting things ever to see so many bright intelligent people taking hits of a small little vial laughing rolling around.  Jack and I at this point decided to split one more fake E(5-meo-dipt).   we went into the washroom i bit off half the pill and swallowed quickly followed by a gulp of beer to kill the foul taste. and gave the seccond half to Jack.We walked back into the party room with good spirits.  Only to find Neil puking all over the place and antagonizing our unfriendly hosts.  From this point on a fight almost broke out several times. Jack and I quietly enjoyed observing this funny somewhat alien drunken behavior.The party's level of class kept degenerating throughout the night, with bottle rockets being shot out of Chris's mouth, and then chris trying to shoot a bottle rocket out of his ass much to the entertainment of our group, who was just trying to have fun. At one point our companion chris took off his pants, to the displeasure of our loser hosts, probably because they were really homophobic.During this time i had downed aproximately 6 drinks.  I was feeling a little buzzed off the alcohal, a little high off the mystery drug as shane and i had named it, and a little stoned off the pot. We kept taking hits of rush throughout the night followed by insane laughing fits.There was an issue about our hosts trying to steel Neil's cds and hiding them in the freezer. we found them and stole some beer to punish them, if a fight broke out Im confident our group would have destroyed them making them timid to do anything really confrontational to us.  We had finally left the party, and we were glad to have crashed such a jerk's birthday. Chris went home, and Daniel and I went to Jack and Neil's house.This is when stuff really got fucked up.  Neil was really drunk, and really wanted to do magic mushrooms. Jack was too tired, (it was 3am) and i was eventually persuaded into joining him, but i would only do it if they would give me their last E pill which was real mdma, unlike the crappy ones we had recieved that day.  Daniel decided he would stay up and watch us, so he took some smoked a fair ammount of crystal meth.  SO here i was drinking Mushroom tea with Neil, and with the last gulp i washed down my E pill. Neil was on the verge of passing out from his drunkeness at this point, so i went looking for Jack or daniel, i found them both in the washroom taking meth hits off a small glass pipe. i was really getting fucked up at this point. crazy pattern visuals, breathing, and this was 5 minutes into my trip so i was very excited. All of a sudden Jack passed the pipe to me and I took a hit of meth.  I wouldnt have done this normally, speed was one of those drugs i really never wanted to try. but in my impaired state i didnt really have good judgement.  Jack at this point handed the pipe to daniel and told us he wanted to try to go to sleep. Daniel proceded taking more while i walked outside. Just before i walked outside i saw snakes all over the ground. and heard them. it was kind of like raiders of the lost arc where indiana jones is in the pit of snakes.I thought if i can get through this my trip will be good so (probably looking like a total idiot ran) around the drive way with arms flailing, and after I returned to the house i felt like i was invincible. Neil, daniel and i decided to go on a walk. we walked to a small park where Neil started wigging out bellow the childrens swing set, in the middle of our conversation.  I then had the brilliant idea of trying rush. I had given the vial of rush to daniel to hold so i wouldn't break it while incapacitated on mushrooms.  so i had asked him to give me the bottle I took a hit and apparantly he had to grab it from my hands because i nearly dropped it. at first it felt like i was spinning around and around, then it felt like i was standing still and the world was spinning around me. very trippy.  we returned to neil and jack's house, where i think daniel no longer was having any fun and decided to go home.  I think the mdma kicked in around then because i started feeling very very happy, and it felt like pleasure was pulsing through my body.  the closest thing that describes the feeling that i was having then was orgasms happening at different parts of my body, pretty cool. the next three hours Neil and i had really great conversations only interrupted by insane trips. the only ones i can remember are, i thought i was in a ferrarri flying through space smoking meth with god. i thought i was a flower whose only reason for existence was to play music with other flowers and each flower could only make one sound. Finally i thought i was having sex with the indian goddess shiva. Neil had a very similar experience.  Finally we noticed we were comming down and were both soo happy and content and talking about how it was the best trip of our lives.  We were sad that mushroom trip was leaving us but the comedown was very introspective and insightful, and quite pleasant. suprisingly we only felt mildly hungover the next day. A small price to pay for such a fantastic night. My boyfriend had just returned from visiting his folks in NC, and we were going through some troubles. Mostly my fault. Never ask too many details about previous sex partners/practices. Just make sure there's no disease and forget it.So I arrived at his place. He had wine, dinner, candles...all that. We were having fun just talking. After awhile the wine was gone. So we popped open another bottle. Then that was gone, so we hit the peach schnappes and had two or three fuzzy navels. Then we smoked some weed. Then he told me, when I called his previous sex partner (a friend with benefits sort of situation) a squat whore resembling a hobbit, that he didn't agree with my viewpoint. Instead of stopping there he told me she was the most beautiful women he'd ever seen naked. EVER! This of course upset me. He told me I *was* attractive, but basically I wasn't all that, to paraphrase. Due to my then five or ten extra pounds (all in the gut).So I did what any 22 year old woman would do. I yelled at him and then did about six to seven shots of Vodka in a row while he was in the bathroom. My goal was death. Earlier that year (or the one before) a nineteen year old kid had died when some sailor dared him to drink an entire bottle of Vodka.The rest of the night is basically gone. I guess the term is blackout. I was awake, interacting, talking, and moving about. But I don't think I knew it. I then related to him something that had never happened to me. He later says I was in tears. Something about a Sunday school teacher trying to get it on with me.I then did many sexual things that I wouldn't normally partake in. But I remembered none of it. He could of made the whole thing up, and I wouldn't know the difference. Its just things he described meshed with things I thought had been a dream. And oh ya, I also pissed all over myself in my little drug induced coma. I'll never drink an entire bottle of wine, three fuzzy navels, did I mention the screwdrivers?, and six shots of vodka in a six hour period ever again. I have been smoking pot on and off for about a year.  I have been anywhere from slightly buzzed to pretty stoned.  However, about a week ago, I got more stoned than ever in my life.The evening began with drinking with friends.  I had about five beers or so and was somewhat intoxicated and decided to smoke pot.  I never before smoked much pot while being drunk, so I thought I'd try it out.After three full bong hits (which usually just gets me mellow), I immediately felt the marijuana come on.  It seemed like my typical feeling except that it began almost immediately.  However, after about ten or fifteen minutes I 'forgot' where I was and quickly remembered.  My short term memory was so shot that it seemed as though I were constantly waking up from being asleep--reorienting myself, reminding myself where I was.  I started feeling anxious and restless and so decided to leave my friends and listen to music in my room.  When I closed my eyes, I could literally see the patterns in the music and I felt them very intensely.  I became so excited and had an intense desire to be with others, so I returned to the room where my friends were.  As I stood up, it seemed as though my feet were miles below me.  When I stretched out my arms, they seemed much longer than usual.  When I moved my hands in my peripheral vision they looked very different than usual, which seemed very amusing to me.I came back to be with my friends.  When I got there I began to see everything differently.  I was not hallucinating per se, seeing things that weren't there--everything looked the same, but just seemed very different.  I felt as if reality were a movie I was watching from far away.  Everything real seemed like a joke and not real.  It felt like where I was was real and that reality was something I was watching, because everything was disjointed and unconnected.  Causes and effects were divorced: everything was just actions in an ever changing present.  Though it was disorienting, it was rather pleasant and everything seemed humorous.  I felt no inhibitions and said anything that came to mind.  I would spontaneously start laughing at anything.  Everything seemed more interesting and heightened.  Foods tasted better, music sounded better, because everything was an immediate rush of sensations.My friends left and I sat alone.  My arms began hurting and I thought that the veins in my arms were exploding.  I knew that this was just paranoia from the cannabis and it stopped bothering me.In retrospect, I think it must have been the alcohol that intensified the pot experience.  The experience was one of my most profound and dramatic, lasting several hours.  I went to bed at +4:00.  In the morning I was back on Earth but only 99%.  I still had residual effects throughout the day. Last weekend I tried 2-CT-2 for the first time. I was staying at a friend's place in the woods with about 20 others. After drinking about 12 beers over the course of a few hours, one of my friends offered to share a hallucinagenic pill with me.I asked him if it was mescaline, since he'd recently tried some, and he told me that it was 2-CT-2. Neither of us had taken it before, but felt comfortable about it since we'd both eaten shrooms and acid many times before. We opened the 20 mg pill and made two lines.After blowing the powder, both of us started experiencing effects within minutes. We had seperated very soon due to differing interests. If we had realized that the effects would come so fast, we'd have stayed together that first while.It was dark out, and I was tripping pretty hard after 5-10 minutes. Having no sign of my tripping partner, and being surrounded by many drunk belligerents that did not know what I'd done, I retreated to my a girlfriend's car to relax for a while. At this point I was experiencing visual effects much stronger than any acid I'd ever taken, and I was actually worried for my health.My girlfriend came to the car soon, finding me there to her surprise. I informed her of the situation, and she helped comfort me a little. I exited the car so she could move it down by the newly-lit bonfire, and proceeded to vomit all the beer and food I'd consumed.My uneasy feelings persisted, and so I returned to the car and laid for about 40 minutes with my girlfriend. I felt cold and needed several blankets. I was feeling much more comfortable as time went on, although I felt mentally unable to hang out with all the people who were simply drinking. The visual effects were astounding. I saw tracers, morphing objects, general changes in hues, and I even saw it quickly light up outside many times as if there was lightning or a strobe light. I also had physical feelings similar to ecstacy and acid body highs.At this point, my tripping friend appeared. He stayed in the car for a while, informing me that he'd vomited soon after taking the stuff. He had laid in the grass away from everyone for the last 40 minutes, also unable to be social.Ten minutes later we became comfortable enough to head out to the bonfire with all the others, and had a great night from then on. I played guitar for hours, with all the drunk kids singing along. I kept tripping for the next 2 hours, and the effects slowly tapered off for hours afterward.Besides the uncomfortable feelings the I experienced at the start, I enjoyed the experience. If I had known more about what I'd taken or had taken it before, I would've fared much better. I was not mentally prepared for such strong effects to take hold so quick, and I was not familiar with the drug.For people who are trying this for the first time, it may be better to take orally. If you insufflate it, know that it will hit hard and fast. I have taken acid about 20 times and shroomed about 7 times, and nothing has compared to 2-CT-2. I would try it again, eating maybe 20-30 mg or blowing 10 mg like I did, but no more than that. The effects from 10 mg insufflated was strong enough for my tastes. Last night me and a few friends decided to head into NYC and go to a club.  On our way there, I purchased some beer for a friend and I, and in return he gave me 2 (two) 200mg pills of Provigil in response to my complaint because we has no amphetamines left.  He said to take the pills and that they'll keep me going through the night.I had a lot of money to burn, so after we got into the club, I immediately started drinking beer after beer and a few mixed drinks.  After a while I was feel rather good.  The Provigil kept the sleepiness of alcohol away and helped me move and produced clearer more concise thoughts.  This was definetely a lot of fun, and I continued to dance and talk and the likes.For the next few hours, I drank steadily and got to the point where I could no longer fully stay awake, so I found 2 more Provigil and a half hour later, I was right back up to where I was, but with an increased sense of euphoria.  I was extremely upbeat, happy and the music sounded good, so it all created an extremely nice atmosphere.Around came 4 or 5am and I decided to head home.  I tried rather hard to sleep and when I got back up and went to work, I still felt it with me.  It was really sort of reassuring because otherwise I have a hard time staying active. As many teenagers out in the world, it all started off small. I began drinking at the age of 15. At first it was sooo great. Any problems I had were instantly flushed away and I felt on top of the world. Never in my entire life I felt anything that felt so damn good. As time went on, I began drinking like a fish. I was getting cocked at school even. I used to get drunk to the point where I would be throwing up and passing out... How ever I saw any fun out of that I still dont know to this day. Even with my mother being an alcoholic, I still kept at it. Eventually my mom saw what this was doing to her family and realized that she could potentially lose everything she worked hard for... Her house, 3 beautiful children and her husband. She got her act together but I still kept at it.  Ive always had a thing for cars, and im 18 now. I finally got a really nice car, and was soooo proud of it. All my life my mom used 2 pay for everything I own. I got a job, and began to save up. I ended up buying a 1993 nissan altima decked out for speed. God did I love that car. And for once in my life I was proud to say I paid for it with my own money. IT WAS ALL MINE and I felt sooo proud. Now I always heard all the shit about 'dont drink and drive' but being as stupid as I was did it anyway. I was on my way home from playing pool at a pool hall where I live. I was so fucked up I still dont remember the ride home to this day. I was about 1/4 mile from my home when hell opened up on me. I was pretty much POD'ed and had no clue what the hell was going on. Going about 50 around a bend, half passed out I hit wet leaves and my car did a 180. The back end of my sports car hit a curb sending me and my car I worked so hard for 7 ft off the ground. Now what happends next is from what im told by police and paramedics, and the kind souls that saved my life that night. My nissan struck a utility pole at 50 mph, sending my head through the drivers side window. The impact opened my trunk sending my 12 disc cd stacker flying 30 feet from the wreakage. My sun roof imidieatly flew in front of me 10 ft at the same time I was violently thrown into the passengers seat. Now that night my car was full but earlier I dropped everyone off and was alone. Anyone in that car would have been instantly killed because the rear passenger door was smashed and pushed halfway into the backseat. My stereo system speakers were ripped out of place and ejected. Then as quick as it all went down, I struck a rock after swinging from the utility pole. Everything was once again calm. That night I must have had an angel by me because my car was sooo fucked up, that it looked like a trash compactor was just finished with it. Here's the crazy part. I only suffered bruises, split my head a little that only required 2 STICHES!!!! And got knocked out. For some reason my life was spared that night, and I am realizing now why that was. That was my wake up call to cut the shit with binge drinking and drug use. I wasnt ready to die yet and have some purpose on this earth. Call it what you want to call it, but I call it fate. Drinking almost DID take me to a place I have never been before....that is my very own grave. Im so happy to be alive and see what life is really about now.Im an as strieght as an arrow now and call me a pussy if you want to, but I am damn proud of it. I almost died that night and would have never have had the chance to see my friends or family EVER again. Now to all of you who follow what I used to do, think again please. You might get your wake up call too, but chances are you wont be so lucky. Im not saying stop totally, but have a sober driver at least because the guilt you will live with killing someone will be horrible and I dont think you want to live your life as a murderer. Look alive and be true to yourselves, dont walk the same path I did please! Try to get something out of all of this and realize next time what could happen. Death is a high price to pay for any of us. Peace and be smart!! Mixing drugs and alcohol is never a smart thing to do. Being college educated, one would think that I would know this and adhere to it. But in the midst of my experimentation and stupidity, I spent one night of my life nearly dying. A friend of mine is addicted to pills, particularly xanax. Grudgingly one night he sold me two footballs. I ate the first one, then waited about a half hour and ate the other one. In between taking the footballs I smoked a blunt. Feeling great at that point, I smoked more pot, I can't remember what exactly, probably like a bowl or two. I was looking foward to a great evening. I was feeling relaxed, euphoric, down for anything. About an hour after taking the first football my boyfriend, our friend and myself went to a friend's apartment. He offered us some rum. I was feeling awesome already so I threw back 4 shots of rum. This coming from a girl who usually SIPS her alcohol. It only took a few minutes before my head started pounding and my stomach was turning upside down. I stumbled into the bathroom. I have no clue how long I was in the bathroom or how much I even threw up. Eventually my boyfriend came in realizing that I wasn't in good shape, he stuck his fingers down my throat and made me throw up. I remember thinking, damn this kid's never satisfied, cause he just kept making me throw up over and over again. It wasn't until later that I realized his actions probably saved my life. All the throwing up left me light headed and I still felt like I was not in the clear yet. The whole time I was hearing voices in my head and starting to freak out. It's the worst feeling, knowing that you have no control over your mind and body. My boyfriend forced me drink cup after cup of water and sat with me in the bathroom for what seemed like forever. Eventually, the other guys came to make sure everything was ok. From what I was told afterwards, I had to be carried by two guys through the halls of the apartment building and put into my boyfriend's car. My boyfriend took me back to his house and made me drink more water.I consider myself lucky that I had someone looking out for me. If I had just gone into that bathroom and passed out, I know that I wouldn't have woken up. A person with a low body weight like myself should NEVER mix pills and alcohol. BE CAREFUL! I am  drunk right now, and so I thought that this would be the opportune time to write a report about the effects of alcohol. While attending a Glassjaw concert, I dropped four (at least) shots of vodka. Several hours later, I find it difficult to maintain equilibrium, and I am overcome with a nearly intolerable dizziness. I find it hard to maintain consciousness. There is a horrible, lingering taste in my mouth, which is very dry, almost nauseatingly so. Nothing feels real (as if I am in a dream) and pain/pleasure are practically indistinguishable: Any intense sensation is positive and preferable. I can barely stand.My girlfriend, who has had less to drink but is somehow more intoxicated, has long since passed out and has become vomitting badly. I think I was in the pit. My arms hurt, and lifting them is quite the herculean task. I feel giddy and nihilistic, yet very tired at the same time. I don;t know why I wrote this. Reported Dose: 8 Mixed drinks, 2g cannibisIt was my 22nd birthday party, and I had been drinking throughout the night. At around 11:30pm someone had asked me for a ride home. I obliged, knowing that I was sober enough to drive. At the time, I suspect I was near the legal limit when I got behind the wheel. And then I made two of the worst mistakes of my life. By the time I arrive at my friends house, he decides that he doesn't want to go home yet, and suggests that we have another drink. 'C’mon man, its your birthday!' He says, and I obliged. One drink turns into six, and by last call I was completely intoxicated. At this point my friend wants to come stay at my house, so we start heading back, knowing that the whole trip was pointless to begin with. At this point I made the second mistake that ended in my downfall. I began to feel invincible. I decided in my delusional state to run every red light from downtown to my house. My luck ran out when I blazed through a red light at well over 60 miles an hour, coming within feet of striking a squad car. I was immediately pulled over, road tested and arrested. By the time I was detained and processed, I had a blood alcohol level of .167, double the legal limit for a DWAI, and .067 over the DUI limit. At this point I was hauled off to detox, where I was held against my will until 11:30AM the following morning. After my arraignment, plea bargain and sentencing, I lost my license for three months, was forced into alcohol therapy sessions for six months, and ended up paying well over $2000 in fines, fees, and inflated insurance costs. Ultimately, I consider myself fortunate. If I had ran that light 3 seconds later than I did, I would have been prosecuted for vehicular homicide of a police officer. The cop I nearly hit may have very well saved my life. Please, don't drink and drive. I thought I could handle my liquor, until I lost all sense of rational behavior. As the old cliché says: 'The life you save may be your own.' In january of 2002, the research chemical 5-meo-dipt began being sold as 'a candyflip' in my particular group, and it spread like wildfire. I have extensive experiance with the substance and in my trials, I personally have had no abreactions to it, but I was involved with an extremely serious situation which I beleive warrants serious attention.Two 9mg gel tabs of pure powder were purchased by a man well known for having a lot of experiance with halucinogens. We will call him J. He went to a party to trip, and for several hours went by without incident; but after about 6 hours we got a call from one of of the people that he was with saying J was having some problems. This was not at total suprise (1 other person also had a problem; though much less serius; with this particular tryptamine). She told me that he was vomiting violently and his body temp was approx 101. At first I was not too concerned because the moderate body load had caused some minor discomfort in me and others. I told them to give him small amounts of cool liquid and to take his shirt off and give him a damp towel and a fan to cool himself at a rate that was comfortable to him (he was slightly agitated and withdrawn; and to keep an eye on him and call me to come over if he wasnt getting better in an hour.  About twenty minutes later she called to say that he was getting somewhat more agitated and out of control. She also took this oppurtuntty to tell me that he had also been smoking crack and coke freebase, snorting lines, and drinking heavily while on the 5-meo-dipt; all of which he was warned not to do before hand. She wanted me to come over because I was the member of our group with the most experiance with 5-meo-DIPT, but he is one tough guy and he said that if anyone else came over, he would kill them (he had a history of assault and violent crime), and I did not doubt him at this point. She suddenly said that she had to go and I did not hear back from them until the next morning when I was told that J was settling down and that was going to eat somthing and try to go to sleep. I took this as a good sign and I did not hear anything form that group until 4 or 5 days later when my friend C en at has house and that shit went crazy.  I had recently started taking the diet pill, Xenadrine, to keep my energy up and make my metabolism faster. I had two pills in the morning, around 5am before going to work. Later that night a few of my friends and I went to a club where I consumed 4 drinks in a matter of two hours. I was feeling quite drunk off of those 4 drinks, and I can hold my liquor quite well. As the night wore on I began to feel sick so we all left. As soon as I got in the car and it began moving I felt like I was going to puke and that's where it all started. I began throwing up violently in my friends car and all over them. I had never felt so horrible in my entire life. I threw up the entire way home (50 min) and continued to vomit when I got home. My boyfriend had to carry me inside because I couldn't stand. I eventually fell asleep for about 5 hours and awoke the next morning to more vomiting. I was puking up stomach acid/clear liquid because there was nothing left in my stomach. In the bathroom I blacked out and fell on the ground and started having a seizure. I could feel myself shaking violently, but my vision was completely black. The seizure stopped seconds later and I was scared as hell.I went to GNC where I had bought the pills and told the salesguy the situation. 'Oh NO! You should NEVER drink when you take those pills!' Good story. No where on the bottle OR on Xenadrine's website did it say anything about not drinking.I attempted to have a shot of vodka in my slurpee (yay!) when I had taken a pill in the morning and ended up in a supermarket bathroom curled up in a ball. I was sweating, blacking out and sick to my stomach. I ended up feeling better in about a half hour but was sketched out. The seizure was the scariest part of all of this for me. So....just be careful if you're on Xenadrine and your planning on drinking. I once had a similar story to the guy who was pulled over by the cops [read story], but due to his rights didn't have to have his car searched.  This happened back in '87 when I was a mere 25 years old.  I was out with two other friends and I was driving.  Friend 1--J--and I were indulging in some pot and each drinking a 40-ounce Olde English.  Friend 2--C--had recently gotten clean due to some bad experiences but wanted to come along for the ride.  At some point I had to pull over to take a leak (around midnight, out in the sticks) and as I'm standing there I noticed THE MAN pull up near my car.  Well....in my mind I'm thinking, 'Shit!  My car smells like pot and I've got several opened 40-ouncers!  This is bust material!'  Earlier, I was feeling pretty great but suddenly now I'm practically sober, yet my eyes are pretty red.  Anyways, the officer asks me what I'm doing there and I reply, 'I'm sorry, sir, but I really needed to water the bushes and didn't see any other place I could do so.'  He notices my red eyes and asks what that's about.  I said, 'Well....I've had a long drive today, it's almost midnight and I'm rather tired and I'm in the process of heading home.'  Looking at my car with my two idiot-looking friends inside, the officer then asks if he can check my car out.  At this point I'm thinking I have two options.  One:  like an idiot, I could tell him, 'Yeah, sure...No problem!' and then watch as I get hauled away, or.....Two:  play him and see what happens.  I chose door number two and bravely said, 'Not unless you have a search warrant.'  I saw both my friends' mouths drop as I stood there waiting for the cop's response.  To my relief, all he said was, 'Well, then get in your car and be on your way.'  I cooly walked to my car, got in, started her up and left.  Immediately I asked my sober friend what the speed limit was, he told me and I made sure the speedometer didn't stray from that speed and also made sure I was inside the line.  I watched the rear-view mirror, noticing the cop following me, waiting for me to make a mistake so he could really pull me over!  Thankfully, as I entered onto the freeway the cop continued on down the country road.  At the time I considered that incident to be a lucky situation (there's no telling how another cop might have acted), however, I do believe that it was within my right to state that he could not search my car without probable cause.  Just because my eyes were red didn't mean I was ripped (and I acted pretty sober according to my friends who were watching the whole scenario).  Just remember to play it cool if you're ever in a similar situation.Tom 'Stringman'  DOSE: T+ 0:00 10.5 g oral Mushrooms - P. cubensis (fresh) \\xa0 T+ 1:00 1.5 g oral Mushrooms - P. cubensis (fresh) \\xa0 T+ 0:00 \\xa0 repeated oral Alcohol - Hard (liquid)            BODY WEIGHT:   195 lb         Let me start by giving my hallucinagen back ground.  Acid is my drug of choice, over weed, over everything.  I dorpped acid for the first time at the tender age of 13, I'm 20 now.  In my life I've tripped balls on various substances, LSD, LSA, Mushrooms, San Pedro, pure Mescaline, and PCP.  I've probably tripped around 50 times.  I've gone on Acid binges where I eat a few hits every four or five hours for four days straight.  I've eaten ten strips of Acid multiple times and my record doses for Acid is 15 hits at once and a quarter sheet over an extended trip.  I've been up for 48 hours on mushrooms.  I've grown San Pedro in the past, I ate a cutting once and I extracted the Mescaline and taken that.  I've only had PCP once, but i kind of liked it, but that was a very small amount, I'm sure I'd hate it if I did alot.  I've eaten morning glories a few times, but I don't really consider that tripping, some people do though.  I've tripped several times while suicidal.  Out of all of that, I've never had a trip I didn't like, a bad trip, even this one with all its horror.  Tripping to me is like a roller coaster, it'll scare the living shit out of me at times, but I always know it's just a ride and I'm safe, at least that me.  A quick note about the Celexa before I get to the actual trip description.  Celexa is an SSRI antidepressant, in the same class with Prozac as I understand it.  I've been taking Celexa everyday for about three months now, before that, I was taking Paxil for a year or so.  I've never really read up on if taking SSRIs while tripping is bad or not and I thought I should mention it.  Normally I have a day or two notice before I trip and I stop taking antidepressants, this time I didn't have a warning.  The only reason I screw around with other hallucinagens, esp. mushrooms is because in my part of the US, acid is extremely dry.  I only know one person who has had Acid in the last two years, I personally haven't even seen a hit of Acid since I was a senior in high school.  I like acid because I feel it regulates me, like some people say weed stabalizes them.  Since I can't get acid, I fill my craving with Psyliciban.  It's the same thing just a bit weaker, more visually oriented and less of a mind fuck.  I recently moved into an apartment and started my third semester of college.  After being away from home a couple of weeks, i realized I needed a job.  I can't stand working, so I found alternative income methods, a 'shroom farm.  I produce around a pound of fresh mushrooms every week, four different strains of Cubensis.  They pay my rent and living expenses.  The night of the trip I wasn't even planning on tripping for a few more days.  Then, my roommate realized he lost his fake ID, so we couldn't buy beer like I originally planned, and  was forced to settle for cheap as hell vodka.  I decided against the Vodka and decided to pick a few pin heads a couple of days early.  Initially I only ate about 10.5 grams.  My roommate had a few friends come over, they drank, I tripped.  We started watching a movie.  The intial dose turned out to be way below my standards for tripping so I went back after like an hour and picked more, a gram or two.  This got me started finally.  The movie was great, funny as fuck.  After the movie, we left to go to a friends apartment.  I got there, sat on the couch and like 10 more people showed up.  People say you should never be the only person tripping at a 'party', but that has never bothered me before.  For some reason, probably the large number of people not tripping, really got to me.  I was extremely uncomfortable, I knew they were all watching because no one knew.  I know they had to see my eyes and the unusual amount of sweat on my face, even though the temperature was probably about 65 F.  I got the fuck out of there after like 10 minutes.  I went straight home and listened to music with black lights on.  That was enjoyable for a little while, but I was coming down, so I picked a few more grams, chowed down.  I knew I wasn't ever going to start tripping hard so I decided to start throwing back the Vodka.  I ended up killing the bottle over the next few hours.  I ran out of chaser, so for the majority of it, I drank it straight or chased it with water.  IF you've ever had really cheap Vodka, it's horrible, tastes like rubbing alcohol (to give an idea of how cheap, it was $10 for a 1.67L bottle!).  I have heard that drinking and tripping is supposed to result in your trip going bad, but I've taken shots of Tequila tripping on mushrooms before and it mixed with the trip quite nicely.  It was quite nice in the beginning, it got me to a level of fucked up close to what I like.  I went home, drank some more.  The next thing I know, I'm waking up in the floor blowing chunks everywhere.  While I was passed out I remember having the most horrible nightmares.  I almost never have nightmares, in them I was being tortured, having my fingers pulled all the way back against the back of my hand, one by one, and having my fingernails ripped out.  I could feel the pain, it was really bad.  I got up as soon as I could comprehend what was happening to me and ran to the bathroom.  I took a shower, while in the shower i blacked out and collapsed.  I dont know how long i was there, but when i woke up the water was ice cold.  I got out, in a rage, I'm not sure exactly what brought on the frenzy, but I was in it hardcore, growling grunting, pissed.  I went to my room and found out it was locked.  This sent me overboard.  I went to the kitchen got a knife and started taking stabs at the door.  Several times the knife handle sliped in my hand when i hit the door, causing my palm to slide over the blade, cutting my palm open in several places.  The sight of blood fueled the rage more.  I finally got the bright idea that hacking the door wouldn't open it and that i needed to pop the lock open with the knife.  I finally go the door open, got in, put some clothes on, still in a rage.  Walked to the kitchen to get something to drink, and closed the still locked door behind me.  This got me, and the pain in my hand finally got to me.  I freaked out, started smearing blood on the walls.  I calmed down a little, went and sat in a chair at the dining table.  I went into one of those introspective catatonic nightmares for a while.  While in that, I somehow equated my in ability to keep from locking myself out to the failure of the relationship with the love of my life that ended a couple of months earlier.  I got really deep into the hole.  Suddenly I snapped and started stabbing the table until i bent the knife into an L.  I then went and re opened my door, I decided it was time to try and get some sleep.  I went to get a blender I had borrowed from a girl earlier in the evening and carried it to my room.  I still don't know why I did that.  When I got to my room, I dorpped the glass part of the blender and it shattered very close to my bare feet.  Shards of glass were stuck in my feet, cutting them up to go along with my hands.  I freaked again.  I broke down for some time.  Then became extremely suicidal.  I picked up a nice big chunk of broken glass and checked its sharpness by squezing it in my hand, it was extremely sharp.  I went and grabbed what was left of a pizza I had bought earlier in the day and the chunk of glass and headed back to the bathroom with suicide on my mind.  I sat in there for quite a while, holding that big chunk of glass.  I don't know what happened.  I don't know if I just couldn't figure out what to do with the glass or wether in my subconcious I wasn't serious about this attempt.  Eventually, I just gave up and went back to my room, crawled into bed.  It took a while to go to sleep.  I woke up 6 hours later to many awful sights.  I had quite a few cuts on my hands and feet.  I had glass stuck in my feet probably from when I went to bed, the glass was next to my bed.  I had a huge bruise on my left shoulder and a jammed left thumb, I couldnt bend it more than half way.  Also, I had the hangover from hell. I walked out of my room to see blood smeared all over the walls and drops on the carpet.  Where I puked in the living, it was the worst smelling pile up puke I've ever been around.  The biggest mystery of all, some how, I puked on the ceiling on the opposite side of the room from where I passed out and puked in my sleep.  I cant reach the ceiling and I know I didnt try and stand in a chair and smear it up there, besides the vomit looked splattered not smeaered, like I stood underneath the spot looked up and projectile vomited on the ceiling.  Yes, I will be tripping again, tonight probably, another flush will be mature and ready to be picked either tonight or tomorow.  I don't consider it to have been a bad trip, if anything, it was helpful to me.  I learned alot about myself in the introspection, alot of why I am so depressed about certain things.  I can't wait to have another round with the magic mushrooms. Late one night, after drinking three beers, I went into a drawer and grabbed the Prozac and Wellbutrin I found behind a refrigerator at my friends house. The expiring date read sometime last year, I'd been taking them for a while before that night and they seemed to make me alert, a little happier but paranoid. So being drunk and all I took both bottles and swallowed every last pill. I had no idea what would happen I don't even remember why i took them. There were no effect from then and twemty minutes later when I fell alseep, it was probably about 9:30pm when I first took them.About 2am or so I woke up, I stood up just remembering what I did that night. I couldn't stand up very long, I fell back onto the bed and looked around, the whole room was like looking through a blurry grid, every thing was rotating back and forth very slowy. I wanted to turn the light on as it was scary but I couldn't make it that far, the doorway didn't look very invited either. So I just laid there and took a short nap. I woke up to my heart throbbing, I couldn't tell how fast it was but it was fast. My eyesight was clear now but I was going to hallucinate for a while, the room then started to light up with colors, but it wasn't a good thing. The colored objects were flying toward me, I felt very threatened, they were bubbles that turned into crab like creatures that would move their pinchers and tentacles around at me, I was touching every one of them so they would vanish.Pretty much anything I did made it worse for me, I closed my eyes but I could see things that were much worse in my eyelids. I found a solution, I ran to the light switch, flipped it, and the room was perfect again. I had some fun with this for a while.. light on, light off.. the dark seemed to trigger my halluciations.The day seemed to drift pass me, I was in the bathroom every hour gagging and throughing up any food I ate or water I drank. I couldn't eat or drink anything for the whole morning, so I watched TV to pass the time. That's when I started to see people in the house, a man was laying down looking right at me while I just sat there. I got up to investigate, he got up and went to my room and I followed him. I searched everywhere for him, he just keep appearing then hiding somewhere or running away from me. I thought this was all real so I kept looking for him, I was very very paranoid of everything, a side effect from the drug overdose. After my parents got home it stopped and I began to calm down. I went to the bathroom and locked the door, a legion of spiders started crawling up my legs and all over me. I got into the shower and started ripping each one off one by one. I washed my hair three times and got out, the shower was covered in spiders. After that I started to realize it was me and there were no people or spiders. I was very sick through out the afternoon, exactly like having a bad fever, I drank some 7up and I was fine.It was a intresting experience, terrible yet good, im sure I'm not gonna try this one again. I could feel my personality was temporarily changed, I had some images in my head of murder and suicide, nothing I ever had before. The worst side effect was the paranoia that lasted a week after. If you're wondering this was my first experience with drugs, I'm only seventeen hopefully there will be better ones in the future.  DOSE: 1 tablet oral Pharms - Alprazolam (pill / tablet) \\xa0 8 glasses oral Alcohol - Beer/Wine (liquid)            BODY WEIGHT:   200 lb         One experience worth of xanax & alcohol leads me to believe I'd like more. Was sitting around with my girlfriend and her boss, who suffers from sleeping problems.  It was a very pleasant evening, lots of very interesting and stimulating conversation, with a strong intellectual undercurrent.  It was the first time I'd actually spent time with her boss, and he and I ended up with so many similiar experiences (he's 15 years older)  that he half-adopted me as his younger brother (we also share the same first name!).The conversation steered around to his divorce (which has recently become final) and the biggest trouble that was causing him was the ugly custody situation going on, and how it was causing him a lot of trouble sleeping at nights (which is how he came by the Xanax.)  He offered me one, and as all three of us are fairly experienced and responsible drug users, I felt comfortable taking it for the first time despite the 6 beers already.About 20 minutes after taking the drug, I felt a slight tingling in my legs and feet, and a very warm relaxed feeling creeping over my whole body.  The high it provided was similiar to coke & alcohol's whole-body numb/high feeling of relaxed pleasantness.  After an hour, I was very off my face and loving it.  I knew I was fairly well into the effects, as my speech felt slurred (my girlfriend later told me I slurred a very small amount, but not enough that she thought a person less familiar with me would have noticed.)  My entire body was into a nice and pleasant humming buzz, from my feet to my head, and everything felt warm and very comfortable.  We continued discussing things for another hour or two, at which point we all headed off to bed (we had been planning on staying at his house, as it was a 70 mile drive home).I was fairly well gone by this point, and my girlfriend had to steer me into bed (but she also mentioned that I wasn't sloppy, just half-asleep on my feet.)  I slept like a freaking dead log, and woke up a mere 7 hours later feeling like a brand new man. No headache, no hangover at all (which surprised me, considering how OTC sleep assistance leaves one drugged-feeling in the morning), and I was set to be outside in the bright SoCal sun half an hour after getting up.I will definitely be pleased to get my hands on Xanax again, it was a very pleasant evening. I call it a crazy combo because whenever you mix alcohol with a sedative / hypnotic, you may be digging your own grave.Of course, that's just people who take it to excess amounts. As for myself, on a real mellow evening, there's nothing more enjoyable than taking a couple Xanax tabs and tipping back a few beers. But you've got to know your limit. Usually, with the right pills, it just feels so good and the alcohol just makes it feel so much better... till before you know it, you're blacked out and doing all sorts of crazy shit you will never remember.I have been in this state before, and it's not fun (of course it was fun at first!). Blacking out, vomiting, or experiencing extreme dizziness is usually one or two steps below slipping into a coma or worse. So here's the point of my story.... try this sometime, and you'll see why I like it so much. Be careful though, it becomes addicting, and habitual intake of alcohol and pills can really fry your liver.Here's the suggested dosage:In a very mellow, controlled setting (such as a campfire) take two or three Alprazolam (Xanax) 0.5mg tabs or up to one and a half 1mg tabs. 0.5mg tabs are usually an off-pink color, while the 1-mg tabs (the best) are usually a deep blue. Chase the pills with a LITE beer, sipping slowly. Don't drink to fast or too much... unless you wanna wake up the next morning covered in your own vomit, hearing stories from your friends about crazy things you did. Drink no more than two beers per hour. Even after drinking just one beer after taking Xanax, you will definitely feel the effects at the onset (20-30 min). (Note: Beer and Xanax are the perfect two substances for coming down from coke or crank)Usual effects after 3-4 beers (although this depends on the person's body weight): Giddyness, warm rushes throughout the body, extreme euphoria, flushed skin, jelly-like feeling in the legs. Comedown effects: same as above but with decreasing intensity. Deep sleep usually follows within 3-4 hours. Negative effects (but only if you overdo it): vomiting, blackouts, delirium, hallucinations, coma, overdose, death.be careful!!!! I'm an eighteen year old Ecuadorian American guy.  I am a very liberal philosopher/photographer/mediator/student.  I consider myself intelligent, creative, ambitious, and curious, and only recently have I tried to expand my consciousness with mind-altering substances.  After extensive visits to Erowid's Psychoactive Vaults, I discovered salvia divinorum.  The substance greatly intrigued me and I soon read almost all of the reports regarding salvia on Erowid's site and others.  I finally made up my mind to try it first hand, although I was apprehensive because my only previous drug experiences consisted almost exclusively of cannabis, alcohol, and kava (although I have tried threshold doses of LSA and Mescaline).  It's important to note that my interest in psychedelics isn't simply an adolescent desire to get fucked up, but a serious search for meaning in life.  After looking for the cheapest price on the net, I finally opted for an ounce of plain (but guaranteed to be potent) leaves: $33.  After a painstaking month, the ounce finally arrived, crushed to hell, as expected - goddamn US postal service.  That was two days ago.Today was the day of my last AP test and I had been stockpiling illicit substances in anticipation of a huge party afterwards.  After the test was over (around 3 pm), a bunch of friends gathered together and smoked three or so fat bowls.  I also had a few shots of Bacardi O (tasty).  We all chilled at R's house until 7:30 when I had to head home to finish some college apps.  By then, all the affects of the weed and alcohol had dissipated.  I returned to R's an hour and a half later dead sober.  This fact was soon remedied by four or so shots of blackberry brandy and bacardi.Around 9:30, my long-awaited salvia shipment was brought up.  I told them I had it on me, although I also pointed out to them it may not be a great idea to smoke it.  By this time, I was too drunk to coherently explain all the risks that potentially come with salvia (e.g. incredible fear, apprehensiveness, complete loss of safe motor skill).  I was finally swayed to break it out and try some by the interest of a few others.I loaded the bowl of a medium sized pipe and used a pencil torch to fry the leaves.  It should also be noted that three weeks before this, I broke down after waiting only a week for my shipment, and went to a local smoke shop and purchased an exorbitantly priced two-gram sack.  I smoked it all quickly from a pocket pipe, but didn't really feel much more than a light high.  Back to tonight, I took a monster hit from the piece and held for about 20 seconds - the smoke is smooth when smoked with a bong, but very harsh when taken through a pipe.  It was a large bowl and I had fried most of it for my hit.  I exhaled, and started to try to load the bowl again for another individual.  I began to have some difficulty actually putting my hand in the bag of salvia to pinch another bowl.  I shook my head and tried again.  I grabbed some plant matter, but couldn't actually make my hand move to refill the bowl.  I verbalized this fact and said that I had to go sit down (which I already was).  I handed the bag to them and told them to load the bowl themselves.  I then got up (really, really bad idea especially when you've had anything to drink) and sat alone in a secluded corner away from everyone else.  My head buzzed noisily similar to a loud fluorescent light.  I could feel the pressure build in my head as my mind began to free associate.  I saw the ten other noisy, drunk people there, but I felt removed from the actual situation.  Nothing was as it seemed.  I felt surreal and cinematic, almost as if I wasn't really here, but actually observing the current events through someone else's eyes.  During this time, I began to feel my fingers and tows tingle with something akin to pins and needles.  The whole feeling subsided in about ten minutes, but my extremities still felt tingly.  By this time, Three or four people seemed interested in trying it.  I believe I can pinpoint this exact moment as the biggest lapse in good judgment I have had in years.  Although I knew they probably weren't ready to experience salvia, I effectively shirked my responsibility as the supplier of this drug, and the most knowledgeable, and I complied.We broke out a large, 5 person hookah with a massive bowl - perfect for salvia.  Against my better judgment, I lit the bowl, and we filled the massive hookah with salvia smoke.  Almost immediately, the buzz was back, greater than before.  My hands and toes began to tingle softly.  During my salvia high, I tried to somehow visualize the affects the salvia had on my brain.  It was incredible.  With closed eyes, I pictured a three dimensional model of my brain.  I visualized the pressure I felt in my head from the salvia as flashing yellow pressure points all around the top and sides of my brain.  They seemed to permeate into my brain which I thought was very interesting.  I then found I could isolate the affects of the weed on my brain: I found it to be more of a green vine-like hand emanating from the back of my brain, extending its tendrils along the surface while still following the curvy contours.  I found I could also isolate the affects of the alcohol, which appeared to be like a soft bluish glowing pillow surrounding my brain.  I then merged them all into one colorful model and opened my eyes with what seemed like a greater understanding of what was happening.The other for people muttered sounds of shock.  It was clear that they were overwhelmed.  Before I could urge everyone else to stay seated, some people got up and walked around with incredulous and dazed faces, uttering shouts of surprise.  After about two or three minutes, we all calmed down and sat out the rest of the high in relieved sighs.  After about a half hour had passed, and all the affects subsided, we discussed how we felt about it.  As it turns out, many people dropped their hookah hoses and laid down, allowing for all but two of them to take part in this.  Clearly, everyone was overwhelmed by it's instant and intense effects.  Two hours and two shots of bacardi later, a few people wanted to do it again.  It seemed like a good idea (probably because I was fairly drunk) so I packed another very large bowl - I estimate I stuffed close to 4 or 5 grams in it.  We all grabbed our hoses and a friend used a pencil torch while we all sucked.  This is where things got really out of hand.  This hit was much larger than the previous one.  I immediately fell down from the low stool I was sitting on.  I closed my eyes and entered a different universe: a black void with no tangible dimensions.  Yet even though I was in nothingness, I could feel the force of gravity pushing me in different directions (I imagine I was rolling around).  I also heard muffled voices.  At first they meant nothing, but then they became clear, and i understood that many of my friends were speaking.  I opened my eyes and dazedly looked around.  I saw two of my friends who had taken a hit lying peacefully on the sofas, but R, who had taken a large hit was frantically walking around.  Three other friends who were a little drunk, but had no salvia, were trying to talk to him to calm him down.  He was flipping out in the most extreme sense of the word.  R started shouting for everyone to leave and he kicked over the hookah.  He then ran outside into the night and a few of us followed him.  He walked around in small circles with his head in his hands, muttering incoherent things.  I probably would have been scared if I hadn't read that this sometimes happens.  In the midst of all of this, I felt a strong sense of love and understanding for R as if he had been a friend of mine for all of my life even though I had only hung out with him a few times.  R dropped to his knees and beat the ground with his fists, whimpering and crying.  He got up quickly and walked back inside.  He then told everyone inside not to go.  He came outside and beat the wall with his fists.  One of his best friends went over and talked to him.  R shouted to never bring salvia over to his house again or he would kill me.  While this did unsettle me slightly, I knew that it wasn?t really him talking.  He then marched over to me with a dark face, twisted with anger.  It looked as if he was about to hit me.  His friends ran up behind him just in case he decided to do something foolish.  I felt so much empathy for him, I don't think I would have cared if he actually did punch me, but I stood my ground and looked him in the eyes.  I told him I was sorry he was having a bad time and reminded him that I was a friend of his and that I didn?t know salvia would do this to him.  He calmed down some and his best friend J put his arms around both of us and reassured R.  R began to cry again and we told him that we should go back inside and chill.  Fortunately he agreed.  We sat down on the sofa and talked for a while.  By this time, about 1/3 of the people left, leaving only 5 or 6 of us.  J had to leave so I had the duty of taking R down.  I asked him what he was thinking when he said he wanted to kill me.  This seemed to shock him and he quickly said that he didn?t mean it.  He told me he felt that everyone was judging him.  When he was flipping out, I guess he thought everyone hated and was scared of him.  We talked for another half hour about his experience.  I later found out that he had a lot to drink.  I surmise that this (and a busy party-like background) was the key factor in his bad trip.  We talked some more and he told me, despite his bad first experience, he wanted to try it again.The next day, I sold some salvia to him after much convincing.  He assured me that he would not  be under the influence of anything else and have a sober sitter present.  I spoke with him the following day and he told me that he had a wonderful trip.  He said he had great closed eye visuals and mild auditory hallucinations.  He said he definitely wanted to try it again.As for me, I thought that my experience with it was far too brief.  I had a great time while I was on it, although next time, I'll be sure to use salvia without any other drugs to interfere with its effects.  I think I would have had a better time if I was alone.  I would very much like to communicate with the soul of savia that I have read about in ither reports.  I can now see why people use salvia as a sacramental drug, and definitely not as a 'fun' drug.  Although I had read dozens of trip reports before using salvia, nothing could have prepared me for what it was really like.  I look forward to trying it again under much different circumstances. This story is about a year and a half old now, but I have just now decided to submit it for whatever reason.  I am 20 years old now and I still drink, somtimes heavily.  I had drank many times before the night when this all happened and I had thrown up plenty of times as well as blacked at previously, but on this night I went way overboard.It all started off like usual myself and my now ex-girlfriend went to a party at my friends house so I got a shitload of Avalanche.  For several weekends my girlfriend and I had been on a big Avalanche and Aftershock kick, and I had gotten really drunk for a couple weekends in a row and she was pissed at me for getting so drunk the last few times, so I was supposed to 'take it easy' on this night.  So I agreed but as I started drinking I stopped careing and I just kept taking shots, one after the other.  In about 1 - 2 hours we had drank all the Avalanche.  I had no idea how many shots I took because I blacked out for a while somewhere around 13, but a friend of mine and I estimate that it was about 20.So after the bottle is finished I started wandering around looking for my girlfriend and then she later informed me that I found her and we got into it about me being so fucked up and I punched a wall.  Then I proceeded to stagger outside onto my friends pourch which is concrete.  The last thing I remember is falling forward onto my face and laying face down in my own puke.  The next thing I know I wake up inside the house with a wet wash rag on my face at 4:30 am, and all my friends are like 'Holy shit he's alive.'  Apparently while I was unconscious in my own vomit my friends found me and were worried about me.  They carried me in and wiped my face off and watched me to make sure I didnt choke or anything.So next day I go home and have to go out to eat with my dad and have to pretend I not hungover.  My dad thought I had the shits because I kept going to the bathroom to puke at Texas Roadhouse.  To sum it all up, I ended up being sick and not eating hardly anything for 4 days.  I lost 10 pounds and I didnt drink for about 6 months.  I couldnt eat mints or chew gum that was similar to the flavor of avalanche for a while.  That was the drunkest and sickest I have ever been in my life.  Being that drunk was great but being as sick as I was and the threat of being taken to the hospital sucked.  The whole thing didnt really scare me, but made me realize that there is a very real possibility that on any given night I could accidently drink myself to death. I'm in the local high schools pep band. in other words, i was part of the band in the stands at basketball games that plays 'louie louie' and 'iron man' over and over. Sure it was lame, but it was also pretty fun.So one night before the game, a fellow pep band member and i drank a bit and did some nitrous, since my parents were out of town. He had only one shot of what we had (Everclear, which is 190 proof) but i had maybe 3 or four. I handle alcohol very well, so I wasn't too worried. I was still drunk though. So we got to the game and started playing with the rest of the band. I was having some trouble playing because of the alcohol, but not too much. By the half I wasn't even drunk anymore. After the game was over, the bass player and the other drummer and I decided to jam for a bit. Then the bass player found a microphone and plugged it in and we set it up in front of me. We began to play a song I wrote, and I started to sing. Some of the people in the crowd were really digging it (it is a good song) but a bunch of people, 99% of which were male football players, hated it. Most of these people hated me anyway. They decided that the best way to get us to stop was by throwing things at me, which they did with vigor. I was starting to get really pissed, and i started improving lyrics indicating the stupidity of the crowd. Man, was I pissed. After that we all packed up cuz i was so angry. I fumed, ranted, and raved about how much I hated everybody. I said some incredibly mean things to my friends which I later regretted. All of my friends were really shocked at my behaviour and at the things I was saying. And I'm an asshole naturally, always saying mean things, and this shocked even them, who knew my attitudes better than anybody. Anyway, we left and I got dropped off at my house. I was less angry now, but had become incredibly depressed. My parents were still gone, so I said 'what the hell' and started drinking. I drank about four shots in five minutes, then started watching TV. Over the course of the next 45 minutes i drank five more shots of Everclear. This would be the equivalent of drinking 18 shots of an 80 proof liquor such as Vodka. I only weigh 153 lbs., so I got really really really drunk. The next four hours were a blur. I was watching TV but not really paying attention. At random times I would start crying pathetically, and other times i would fly into a blind rage. I was also talking to myself a lot.I was mostly just babbling about how bad life was and how shitty other people are. After awhile i turned of the TV and put in a videotape called 'Closure' which is a tape containing all of Nine Inch Nails' music videos, and some live stuff. I was enjoying it a lot, except during one video('gave up') i saw Trent Reznor(NIN guy) make a face while singing that reflected all the pain and hate i was feeling right then. In a way it was a beautiful moment. I felt so connected with him and the lyrics and also the music. It all seemed more important and mooving than it ever had before. So I kept watching, but I was getting more and more depressed. I was lying on the floor, babbling to myself and crying while watching the video, when i started to cut myself with my pocket knife. Not very deeply, but enough to draw some blood. I also cut a hole in my pants while trying to stab myself. Man I was freaking out. I was pathetic, and I realized it, which made me even more depressed. I had a million little cuts on my left arm, two on my right arm, and a bunch of big deep long ones on my stomach. The next thing I knew it was next morning. I had no hangover, but I was very tired and still feeling depressed. My parents had gotten home late that night to find the house in perfect condition. Apparently, even while incredibly drunk i was responsible. I had apparently cleaned the whole house and hidden all the contraband during that time I couldn't remember. I took a shower and looked at my cuts. I wore a long sleeved sweatshirt until the ones on my arms healed. Luckily, most of my cuts healed without scarring. I have two or three barely noticeable scars on my arms now, though, and one or two on my stomach. What I did that night was stupid. I drank so much for my body weight that i could have died quite easily. Luckily i didn't, though at the time i didn't much care. Let this be a warning to you not to drink alone while under extreme mental duress, especially while depressed. I hope this was helpful, or at least interesting. From previous experience I now know to take acid in a place were you feel secure, likley to be amoungst friends in a familuar atmosphere.  The experience I'm refering to, I did exactly that and yes, I felt 'at home', secure and excited... The acid I took was labled 'Bart Simpsons' apparently well dipped and quite potent.  This information was provided by the one I purchased the acid from, so the warning was not taken extremley seriously as everyone wants to buy 'potent' acid.  Anyway, I let one and a half tabs dissolve underneath my toungue and waited; filling in the time with the use of weed and beer.  Slowly the effects crept upon me, but however don't hit all at once, I relised I was wasted when I'd already been wasted for at least half an hour.  The memory of the experience is not as vivd as what I would like, I think that tends to happen when you take the drug though; from what I can remember the first signs were a pulling tension on my upper check bones and an insaciable urge to grin evil looks at the same spot for what I'm not sure regaurding periods of time.  As the night continued the acid released more charges of 'blissful emptiness' which felt incredibly fulfilling in a tripping like way.  On LSD it feels so pleasing to be so wasted, I could almost describe it as being totally plastered from alcohol but without the bad side effects; although I feel a little less orientated and a little more scattered... I almost feel like a shady/dark person while strange thoughts rush through my head(being what I usually wouldn't think).I found myself feeling at some stages anxious and at others calm, my mind was all over the place and I wasn't sure what to do with myself.  Sometimes I even felt bored in the beggining but after it kicked in properly I was rushing for hours!  Laughing came freely and often, funnily enough the laughing was at nothing; just uncontrolable fits of laughter for no reason(besides acid of course) Definatley the most potent drug I've tried and to this day my favorite, I suggest to people who hav'nt tried it... don't miss out it's an ensured good(or at least extremley wasted) night! There wasn't really much to do after school on Tuesday, so I decided to get some friends together and take some ludes… they were up for it. The pills we took were marked 'LEMMON 714'. I got them from some guy that had like 500 of 'em. We each took a shot of 99 Bananas and I took out the pills.[Erowid note: Quaalude Lemmon 714's were last produced in 1982.  In the 1990's, underground knock-off products were produced and sold bearing the same marking.  These counterfeits when seized and tested by law enforcement agencies were found to contain various benzodiazepines, but no quaaludes.]We started around 3:20 or so. P took one, then C, followed by yours truly. We were going to wait for the effects to kick in while drinking some beers. I got my supply out, and we drank 2. Nothing really happened, until P and I went outside to smoke a cigarette. The feeling couldn't be compared to anything… it was like we were a little drunker. It was like the 2 beers we drank felt like 3. I was feeling something. Like the feeling that was inside of me was ready to be unleashed by more alcohol. We went back inside and just started downing more beers. After about half an hour, P and J went to get some weed (goodness). I stayed back with C and drank more. I think I drank 3 more and took another shot. That is when C and I noticed that something was different… we were wasted. I got up for a moment to go put on some music and realized that my legs were going numb. C didn't even want to stand up to find out how it felt.After about another half an hour, P and J came back with goodness. P broke it up and rolled it into a blunt. Mom doesn't really want me smoking in the house, so we all went out back by the gazebo. Roll, roll, roll your joint, twist it at the end. Take a puff, that's enough. Pass it to a friend. Following that, I was really messed up. I only smoke weed as a side dish to other drugs, and that did it for me. The cigarette after everything really set me on my way. The top of my head started to tingle.Looking back at what happened, I think that ludes only make you feel drunker. It's nothing special. I admit that I didn't mind the taste of the alcohol that much as I normally do. In addition to that, there might have been some slight euphoria. I was feeling pretty good… it made me feel cooler, like I knew what I was doing, and the weed didn't make me that paranoid. When my friends left, I passed out (around 8pm). Next thing I knew my mom woke me up at 1am and told me that I have to go sleep upstairs in my bed since I had school the next day.  Past that, everything is a blur. I can't remember how I got upstairs. I can't remember how I remembered to set the alarm clock to wake me up later that day… nothing.The alarm woke me up at 6:10. I got up and didn't know what the hell was going on. I didn't feel like taking a shower. I was really hungry tho, so I went downstairs and had some snack food. Then I went back upstairs and got ready (skipping the shower part). Throughout the whole day in school I couldn't even keep my balance. I was stumbling like I was still drunk, and felt extremely tired. After 5th period (lunch), I felt a lot better. I finally woke up and was able to function properly.In conclusion, ludes are fucking great. Smoking weed with helps.      It was a Wednesday night in my dorm room at about 7.  I was drinking straight vodka from a bottle that was actually a used water bottle so that it could be snuck into my dorm room without notice.  We finished the bottle in about a half an hour.      I didn't even want to drink that night, because I had a test in my 8AM class the next morning.  But I was upset over the troubled relationship that I have with my boyfriend, so I drank more than I should have in a very short period of time.     I passed out at about 7:30 and didn't wake up until 9:30.  I had an overwholelming urge to throw up.  My boyfriend grabbed the garbage can and so I didn't get the puke all over.  I called one of my friends, but I don't remember what was said.  I had to walk my boyfriend out at 10:30 and I barely made it up to my room.  I stipped off my jeans and passed out in my bed.     My head felt like an overfilled balloon.  Everything was spinning too quickly for me to keep up and I kept thinking how much I didn't want to get up the next morning.  My arms and legs felt like lead and I kept leaning off of my bed to throw up into my garbage can.  I slept soundly between throwing up though.  I realized this morning that I was throwing up blood.  That must have been alcohol poisoning.At 12:30, my boyfriend called because he was worried about me.  About the same time, the resident director of our building came to check on me and asked 'Do you have alcohol poisoning?'  When I said no, she walked away and that was it.  I laid back down in my bed and passed out till 7AM.I went to take a shower and I fell down 3 times in the stall because everything was spinning so badly.  I threw up three times after my shower, but I hadn't eaten since lunch (about 11:30) the day before, so I threw up some of the water that I had had to drink that morning.  I made it to my class and looked at the test and noticed that it was spinning really quickly.  I wanted to throw up, but I didn't.  I came home at about 8:30 AM and slept until 12:30.  Drinking isn't bad, but I really should have paced myself.  I had too much in too short of a time period.  And I hate being sick and throwing up!! There was a great rave happening about 90k's out'a town, in a valley (middle of nowhere) so me and some of my friends had decided that we would go. I had been working about 9 hours that day and was a little bit tired so I decided that I neede a little bit of help to stay awake. Wnt to the local pharmacy and bought some of this stuff called 'Vig' wich has a combo of Guarana, Ginseng, and Ginko. The packet said to take about 2 a day but I thought 'what the hell, I'm tired!' so I took about 7 an hour beore arriving at the site. Once there, in the tradition of things I had quite a bit of vodka and then there's a gap of about 30 minutes where I don't remeber too much. The next thing I knew, I was sitting down on one of the hills amongst the crowd to just listen to the goovy muzac...I was very decently trashed on the vodka by then but suddenly things started spinning sound like the whole planet was in fast forward and that really freaked me out so I stood up as quickly as possible and the spinning stopped after a few minutes. It was then that I felt 'awake' while being drunk...not really sure how to describe it...kind'a felf a little invincible and although my motor skills weren't all that good my mental condition was brilliant. I decided to dance for a short while...6 hours later I was still going at it without a single break. I was amazed so I went to my friend's tent to tell him of what I was experiencing. He was not there so I thought I'd have a lie down and went out like a rock. About 3 hours later I woke with the a very calm but very rich euphoric feeling. ALL the alcohol had left my blood, or at least it felt like it did and I felt absolutely at peace with everything for the rest of the day, like I could never be sad or upset. Never repeated the experience so I don't know what it really was. I've been brewing homemade mead for about a month now. Seems harmless right? Just mix, heat, and let it sit for a month under a bed next to a heater..... A word of caution- Release the pressure in the bottles every day! 3-lieters of fermented honey exploding under your bed like a rocket is very hard to explain to parents! (don't ask how I explained it to mine!) I'm still brewing, but using caution! I have been drunk befor this. But this was by far the most drunk I have ever been and ever intend on being. The week befor my friend and I both took 5-6 shots of hard liquor and were pretty fucked so we decided we would do it again this time we were gonna have a whole 750 ml bottle of Vodka 40% between the two of us plus 2 mikes hard lemonades each. Not wise...We got a buddy to boot for us because we are both under 18 then we hid the shit in my basement and my friend stayed the night. We watched movies not really thinking of anything but drinking. Finially my dad went to bed and we brought out the liquor immediatly after. Starting with the mikes hard lemonade at about 1:30 or 2:00. We finished those in about 30 minutes then brought out the 2-6 of Vodka. We started taking shots. We took 1, 2, 3. After the third or fourth I could feel it very well. We were both laughing at the stupidest things and couldnt really stand up strait. We took more and more after 7 shots everything faded and I cant remember what happened after that point. I wake up in a hospital bed! I could not believe it I was still really drunk. I ask the nurse what time it is. Its 10:00 am. Shit! Shit! Shit! I know that Im in trouble now! I ask the nurse not to tell my parents she says its too late. I here over the intercom them paging my mom. Damn it! I go use the washroom then come back and my mom is there. We check out and take a cab home the whole way Im begging my mom not to tell my dad. I get home and my dad already knows he sends me up to my room and says he dont want to see me. Once I sober up I go downstairs and find puke all over the basement and a giant whole in the wall plus chips and shit all over the floor. I guess we both finished the vodka. Apparently We stumbled all over the house and I passed out on the back deck then my parents got up and called an ambulance for me because I almost went into a coma. Ill never ever drink that much again and dont advise anyone out there drink too much too fast like I did. I will drink again but not so much so fast and not for a while.   It occured to me today when my beer brew kit began bubbling, that I could effectively kill two birds with one stone. why not place the beer next to my homegrown fan to utilise the carbon dioxide let off during fermentation, so saving money on a cylender of CO2.   Also the room is kept at a constant 22.3 degrees C which will be muchly apreciated by the fermenting ale I'm sure. This is a recent story of what happened when my two friends came over to smoke up with me.  I should add that I was recently prescribed Xanax (1mg each) for anxiety up to four times a day, and was given a 1 month prescription so I originally had 120 to start with.This story starts with me crushing up 3 of my 1mg pills and snorting them, washing down the awful tasting drip with a glass mixed with ginger-ale and a shot of Bacardi Limon.I felt the Xanax effects instantly... somewhat similar to cocaine... numbness in my face and nose immediately, decent amount of euphoria, and almost a lightly 'tingle' in my body.After a few phone calls and IMs, my friends 'P' and 'R' came over with a 20 sack of weed about 2 hours after the xanax and booze, rolled a blunt and we passed it around for a bit.  I must have gotten about 10 good hits off of it.Every hit got better as I became more and more disconnected from reality. I kept slurring my words and wondering where I was even though we did this in my bedroom.  After this point I don’t remember much, but I know things everywhere were fuzzy and I could barely climb into bed.  While we were all sitting there high I noticed I wanted music more than usual, so we listened to “Black Magic Woman” by Santana and “Simple Man” by Skynyrd, which I remember singing most of pretty well.  I then finally made it to bed after stuffing myself and went to sleep with a tingly sensation in my whole body.Well after this I got an extreme case of munchies so I went through an entire pack of Oreos and a big Wendy’s burger.  I know I passed out after this for almost 7 hours, then woke up and had 2 cigarettes and fell back asleep.It was an awesome experience but it’s unfortunate I can’t remember most of it once the marijuana high set in.  I think the xanax made it hit me harder than usual.  It was definitely something I would try again, although I don’t recommend snorting benzodiazepines of any kind.  They are too hard to crush into a powder and therefore didn’t give as pleasant a drip as cocaine would. I went to a friend's house with two other friends to smoke pot. We had a few grams of cripp (very good stuff, I might add) to smoke. We decided to smoke it out of a home-made gravity bong. I got about 3 or 4 hits and a small marijuana brownie, when suddenly the host's brother comes home with a bag full of magic mushrooms. I took a good hand-full and then some and hung out for a bit. The details from there on are fuzzy, but I headed to the kitchen to satisfy my munchies and proceeded to eat a few more mushrooms and drink a cup of 'shroom tea. I was pretty high from the weed at this time, and being a lightweight on weed and a first-timer with mushrooms, the high was substantial. I asked whose 'Colt-45' drink was in the fridge, and was told that it was now mine, so I drank it. I vaguely remember making some food, and that's where I stopped remembering what happened for a while.With all 3 substances consumed, my friends tell me that I was laying down making hilarious noises and such, but then hopped up on a table and kicked something, which spurred a negative response from my friends. I'm not sure if it's the true source, but this seems to have triggered extreme aggression from me, which was only amplified by everything. I remember ranting things like my screen name 'ubertalldude,' some of my friend's names who were far away, and the phrase 'I am trippin' so ass.' During all of this, I was attempting to be restrained and calmed down by my friends, because I was flipping out on everything. My body was busy yelling things like 'trigger nigger' (sorry to offend, it's probably a reference to a Saul Williams song called 'Tr(n)igger') and just screaming about everything. I kicked my friend's DTV converter box, Wii, and TV antenna off of his entertainment center. I also took the glass out of a table , flipped it upside-down, and laid in the middle of it. I also bit said table, two of my friends' hands, a blanket, and gnashed my teeth in the air. Mind you, during all of this, I was not aware of what was happening because of how high I was. While my body was terrorizing my friends and wreaking havoc on the living room, I thought I was having weird terror-dreams like flying through a storm and being a rubiks cube. I started coming-to after the whole terror-dream stage, and remember seeing my friend's brother's face and thinking that it was far too distorted. I thought the table and entertainment center were too distorted, and took my pants off because they were soaked from all the water I had tried to drink and failed at. I finally fully came-to in my friend's bedroom. There I saw that the floor fan was melting, and so was my guitar. I headed back out to the living room to see what was really up, and remember seeing weed lying everywhere. Then I saw my friend's brother and his friend in the living room smoking a cigarette. The cigarette looked cartoonish and huge, so I took a few drags. I said 'Damn, I can see why people get addicted to these things.' I headed to the kitchen, and saw the Colt 45 laying on the floor, so I picked it up, stared at it, and made some noise resembling 'GDaaaaaaughhhhh.' I headed back to the two in the living room, and saw that the room was shrinking like in a movie. The the couch was melting into the walls, and the two people on the couch were melting into it. Everything seemed to be severely distorted, and I vocalized many times that I was tripping balls. I could describe all the distortions I saw, but it'd take too long, and anybody who has taken magic mushrooms or LSD already knows what I'm talking about.I went back to my friend's room and hung with my friends for a bit, but they were mostly afraid of me, so they went to go sleep in another room. Except, that is, for one of my friends who was in a chair tripping and enjoying himself. He told me to play some cool music, so I played All Mixed Up by 311 on the game Audiosurf (which, I must say, is one of the trippiest games ever and extremely fun in any mind state) and basically aimlessly roamed around the house for a while. After a while of this, I began to come down off everything and started to realise what I had done. The living room was a mess, and I felt my underwear, realising that at some point in the night that I had shat my pants. I went to the restroom, ran out of toilet paper, and decided to take a shower. By this time, it was about 6 AM. I ate the brownie at about 10 PM the previous day, smoked the weed soon afterwards, ate the shrooms at about 11 PM, and remembered looking at a clock for the first time after flipping out at about 4:50 AM. I had somehow given myself a scrape on my right shoulder, two scrapes on my chin, and a good cut on my right hand. I got about 5 hours of sleep, but was awakened by my dad calling me to come home. For the next few days, I reflected upon the trip and became terribly depressed, thinking I was going to feel like that forever. After a few days, I realized I was fine and that the fear was just that: fear. Now I feel fine, and am willing to try them again, but this time, with a bit more precaution. I had a friend spend the night and I had 4 - 10mg Ambiens. We just wanted to get fucked up so we both blew 20 mg of Ambien (2 pills each) and right after I decided fuck it and took two shots of vodka. I was feeling pretty good by now so I made myself a mixed drink with five more shots in it and made my friend one with five shots in it. I chugged the drink and about an hour after that happened I stopped feelin good and started to feel like shit. Then I went upstairs and I started puking up everywhere. After puking 3 times I passed the fuck out on my bed and woke up the next day with the worst hangover ever. I'm still down to do Ambien and drink just never mixed together I thought I was gunna OD that night. I smoked a big bump of jwh-081 from a bowl full of ash before eating.  This drug has an uncanny come up of 3minutes.  So I went and cooked for about 5 minutes and brought my meal back upstairs where I consumed half a shot of 50 proof vodka.  My stomach was relatively empty and almost immediately after taking the shot I felt super drunk, probably 1-2shots drunk.  I also felt a strong indica like body buzz and a weed like mental state.  In general sedated, and relaxed.  There is some unwanted body tension in the jaw and face.  I have to say that you shouldn't eyeball research chemicals, I've been working with jwh-081 for over a year, I bought a bunch and am still smoking it once in a while.  But even I shouldn't eyeball, I've had 3 separate over doses when eyeballing, and trust me you don't want to O.D. on this shit.As far as the jwh-081 is concerned, I sometimes throw up, this is the same with jwh-122.  It greatly potentates the effects of alcohol, the spins come faster and vomiting is more likely.  Unfortunately being drunk and smoking 081 diminishes the positive mental effects of alcohol, mostly I get spaced like I've been doing alot of 3rd generation commercal blend Spice(10/2011-2/2012) and some weed.  The body high is nice though.Be carful folks,  I just posted this because I'm shocked at how suddenly drunk I am from only a half shot of liqueur. Well, so far Ambien on it's own done nothing to me. I just try to sleep and nothing happens. But....when I had alcohol it is a whole different story...I feel like I am floating rather then walking. I even ended up in the pool one night at 3am!!I did crazy things like call my uncle in the middle of the night. Well, he lives in germany so not bad for him, but I can not remember what we spoke about. I remember my 20 year old daughter telling me that I was talking to myself and I just wanted to go out and have fun. I just felt great. I had no hallucinations just my mind was weird. It was as if I was just myself. Without thinking I blabber about but no fear of offending someone. Like this was my inner me. Well, this don't work on insomia for me at all. I just want to party. Thanks for this site,Sonja It started off as a very bad day having terrible quarrels with my significant others who pointed out that I was a failure incapable of rational thought or deed. I then decided enough was enough and I went and acquired the above substances, as I did not have the money required for the purchase of heroin. I put together what I needed and headed home and having read up on the synergistic effects of what I was about to consume I was quite beside myself. The only qualm I did not foresee would be putting a noose round my neck and jumping to end it all. Needled to say I abandoned my plan at the last minute but who knows after all it’s a waiting game, a bluff if you will. Had just begun up-titration of sertraline as per my prescriber to deal with major depression. Had taken wellbutrin for a while but had started to develop shakes in my arms and ringing in my ears. As she'd warned, the first few days of the sertraline made me feel very antsy/nervous, so I took some lorazepam/Ativan to deal with that, and it helped. However, when up to 200mg dose, I went to a party with classmates and blacked out very early into the night and ended up cheating on my girlfriend, something I had never done despite many temptations when drinking. I wonder if the combination made my inhibitions even lower, or something. The hangover the next day was horrible, but combined with guilt, so I don't know how to discriminate between them. I quit the sertraline after this experience, telling my prescriber it was due to the akathisia when it really was out of fear of drinking again and doing something stupid. Watch out when mixing with booze, I'm realistic, I know people drink, it's not enough to say just 'don't do it', just be aware and be careful. My buddy had taken maybe 4 shots of whiskey and drank 3 beers. Nothing crazy but, he had a buzz going. When he got home, he was in a very very happy mood. Ya he was buzzed but he knew quite well what was going on. Him and his buddies had gone for a nature walk earlier and smoked some DMT. It was awesome he tells me. So, he decided to load his pipe the same way. He just used the pipe to scoop up a bunch of DMT and BLASTOFF. [He's pretty sure about 100mg got scooped up because of how much he had left before this incident and how much is left now.]What happened next is so fuzzy... According to his father, he fell backwards off of his chair and cracked his head really hard. I guess it knocked him out. When he woke up, he was tripping fairly good. He felt so immobilized. He thought it was just the DMT because he was laying where he normally does while smoking. He thought he had a life/death trip where paramedics arrived and blah blah blah so, he woke up saying 'Dad I'm sorry' over and over again. He thought that was because in his trip, his dad saw him die.When he woke up this morning he spoke to his dad, his dad told him 'you know, you said some really mean things on that shit.' I guess SWIM hit the DMT, fell and hit his head, then went on a rampage trying to fight his father for no reason whatsoever. I guess after that SWIM had gone and laid back down only to pass out and wake up at the point where he was saying 'I'm sorry.'Now, SWIM knows the alcohol had a good bit to do with it coupled with past issues he's had with his father. I'm sure the hit on the noggin also threw SWIM off (his head still hurts.)Point is, be very careful with when you choose to smoke DMT. SWIM'S dad almost called 911 yesterday... SWIM would have been in a world of shit. Also, don't be a dumbass like SWIM and smoke DMT while sitting on a tall chair.I hope you guys take this warning seriously, mainly newcomers. A friend of mine gave me three pills that he said were muscle relaxers. I asked him if they were like somas, and he's like 'yeah, but better.' Since I've taken a soma and a few shots of alcohol before, I decided to try the same thing with skelaxins. I've always loved somas and alcohol much better than just being drunk. Me and two friends of mine sat in my room, took three shots and one 800mg skelaxin tablet each. Very very soon we were feeling the pill. We were all sitting down on my couch watching Donnie Darko. We all felt really really drunk, but we weren't as out of our heads as we usually are when we're drunk. I think it's because we felt the physical effects of being really drunk, but we had only taken a few shots, so our minds weren't as messed up. We each took one or two more shots and then just sat around.We laughed a lot at things, and walking around was a lot of fun. You aren't in control of your body at all and feel like you're floating and being pulled towards the ground at the same time. It's a very strange feeling, but a very fun one too. I recommend it over somas, although it's pretty similar. I later found out that though that skelaxins are also anti-anxiety pills, so that could have been a reason we all liked them better than somas. The only problem I really had with them is that we went to sleep pretty soon after taking them, and a few hours later when we woke up we were extremely hung over, and I almost never get hung over. Now, we had started at 10:30 in the morning, which is by a long shot the earliest I've ever started drinking, so that might be the reason (we woke up at around 5:00 in the afternoon and felt like shit the rest of the day) but it could have also been due to the pill. Most people find zopiclone has no recreational use. I beg to differ.I have done this far too many times to report on just one event. I start with 7.5-10 mg of zopiclone and then have a few drinks, at least 1/2 pint of 80 proof, and top of the zopiclone later to a total of 15 mg usually. Then drink on! Once I hit 15 mg of zopiclone, it's lights out soon after. I just find that zopiclone combined with alcohol gives very pleasant results. Complete alcohol inebriation is achieved much easier and with a little more sedation/no rowdiness and no nausea. Go a little too far and I will black out. I took about 2.5oz of %41alc alcohol rectally using a “monoject”. In the first half second it burned, then stopped as soon as it had begun. The rest went in without complaint. Shortly after, I had to shit. Badly. For about 10 minutes after I had a slight-moderate irritation in my lower bowel. As it passed I got a mild alc buzz (was a low amount of alc for me).Bottom line is . . . successful? Before I begin start on my experience let me first tell you that I, myself am 110% complete pothead. This was the second time that I did alpha-0, this time was no where close to as intense as my first but back to the trip.(12:00pm-6:59pm)- constant dank smokage.(7:03pm) at this time I consumed the 17 and a half milligrams of alpha-0 which I did by oral ingestion.(7:24pm) I took my first 4 shots of vodaka. I remember the taste of it made my almost puke. I have a weak point when drinking straight clear liquor, drank it alot in my early days and ever since it has been very hard even to smell it. I went to go smoke a cigarette and when I returned I had gotten enough will power to take the other 3 shots.(7:30) The weedman got to my boys house to drop us off a little package with 2 ounces of some good weed in it. Right away we went back in and started breaking it down and rolling blunts.(8:00)  Since I was the one with the best twisting ability so I got to roll the gigantic 7 gram, double blunt leave blunt. It was beautiful, it was 9 inches long and about the fatness of a regular tobacco blunt.(8:20pm) spark the blunt.(8:27pm) I start to feel a bit getty like I do when an acid trip is coming on, but also I was very relaxed since I was high as shit and feeling pretty good from the shots.(8:45pm) still smoking the blunt.(9:27pm) the blunt finally was done. By this time I could see visuals starting to come on. Things are moving slightly, I know this feeling. Not to mention, after that blunt I didn't want to walk, to much effort.(9:42pm) I leave with a good friend to go pick up the snow. We had been planning for a week or so for each of us to get a gram and do it.(9:59pm) A. gets in the car and sells us the yay. While the transaction was going on he offered me a zantex bar for free, and its were talking about here and I cant say no to free drugs. So I got a cd case and crushed up the bar and snorted it in 2 lines.(10:26pm) We get back to the house and head straight for the bathroom to start busting out lines. The reason for going to the bathroom is the house was filled with wasted fiends, we just can't start busting lines out in front of them, so many people will crowd, it's just annoying. So we always just go to the bathroom and lock the door. While we were busting out our lines I took a minute to look up and notice things, I was so frantic before and in to getting business done that I forgot to start enjoying my trip.As I looked around it was quite apparent that I was tripping, the lights had that bright mystic glow they get to them, kind of like when I'm rolling, things were moving all over the place. I then tried to move and it was as if I was glued to the counter, the Z. bar had hit me like a freight train, I was still feeling awesome from the liquor and I was also still high as shit. The lines were busted out. I get a sudden shot euphoria as I lean down to take the line. Great blow, excellent. See I don't like to do coke if it isn't fire. It has to be fire. This is because I was once heavy into meth, and it's hard to go back to coke when meth is a trillion times more potent and gives me alot harder of a speed burst. We went ahead and got a cd case and put the rest of the first gram into lines and put it under the sink.(10:40pm-12:00am) blunt...then line...blunt...line... (etc)(12:01am) by this time I'm peaking on the alpha 0. I'm blown out, I'm high as fuck, still feeling the shots, the bar still going strong. When I look at things the move, lights glow, the sky has constant little white dots almost like static, I'm energetic in my mind but when I go to move I don't get far from the weed, alcohol and Z. bar. Extreme body effects, almost like I'm floating. I close my eyes and I'm instantly taken away from the present and put into the clouds. Just for a moment though, keep them closed too long and my head will start to spin a bit too much and I'd be headed for the toilet.(12:00am-5:00am) basically I stayed peaked on the alpha 0 and kept on smoking and doing lines throughout the night, until the yay was gone(4:48am). (5:01am) I am finally starting to come down off the alpha 0. I was in a completely relaxed mood, just chillen in the living room talking to 8 of my good friends, or at least 5 were still up. Connor, he was the first to pass out at 12:30, he drank mad beer and did 3 zantex bars, so he when he was out....he was OUT! I sat there, retarted and just talked calmly, smoked a few more times and just kind of reflected on my wild night of drugs, one of too many sadly.(7:45am) I finally pass out and slept the entire day, night, and some of the next day(I didn't go to sleep Saturday night, and Sunday was the night of the trip) I woke on Monday at 11:22am. The first thing I said was what the fuck happened.I still see those damn static dots when I look in a blue sky in the day from my first time on it, a week prior. One more thing I want to add about my first time tripping on 5-Me0-AMT is every 5 minutes or so I would roll/pop my neck and it was an extreme methy feeling throughout the entire trip, but especially when I did that. I did it because I would get chills up my spine like it was crooked, very methy feelings, very strange, which also why it made it such an odd one a kind trips. Almost like if I were to take 3 hits of some good acid and do good sized 2 lines of meth. Or, also like the title says Mushroom Crack. That name we got for it the first time we all tripped one it that day. When we were all really starting to feel it and it was kicking all our asses we called Matt, he knows alot about drugs, we described what we were on and you know what he said? He just laughed and said that sounds like you got some mushroom crack son, god damn, fucking stupid. He then hung up. There was a bit of panic at that point but everything worked out. I take somas and alcohol on a frequent basis. I also take just 2 somas but the alcohol varies. Sometimes, I am in a great floaty kind of state and other times I am passed out or pissing myself. Somas mixed with alcohol can be great fun, it's like heroin for me. I work at a strip club and the somas make me fearless and not care if guys are assholes or not. It also makes me so relaxed that I have actually passed out on a customer while giving a lap dance! It's kind of funny when I look back on it, but I also think it is probably dangerous and I should quit before I o.d. I have a million of these stories, none of which I'm too particularly proud of, but this one above all others stand out. I will never forget that night....Friday night myself and three college buddies decide to go check out this new rave club called 'Velvet' that just opened in downtown Austin, TX. Now, my friend of importance here is named Joe. As the norm, we indulged in some ecstacy that night.11:00 Myself, Joe and my other two friends each took our first tab as we were driving down to 'Velvet'11:15 We arrive at the club and start to roll during our long wait in line.12:00 We finally get in. Joe finds a women that catches his eye and wanders off to go talk to her. Me and my other friends start trying to devise ways to obtain alcohol from the bar (being we were underage). At this time we were just starting to feel the effects of the ecstacy and decide the best course of action is to walk up to people 21+, hand them our money, and ask them if they would mind buying us drinks1:00 Being that everyone else was rolling as well people were more then happy to oblige to our request. Joe is nowhere to be found.2:00 After about an hour of drinking and socializing with various other party goers,I pop another tab and hit the dance floor with a girl I've been talking to for a while and proceed to get my boogie on, while my two other friends hang out at the bar. Joe is still no where to be found.4:00 After what seemed like an eternity of dance mania I decide to call it quits, just before taking my last hit for the night. While I might have thought I was a good dancer at the time, in all reality I was just playing hop-scotch without moving forward. Again, Joe is nowhere to be found.4:30 Joe is found! He comes running up to me excitedly explaining to me how he meet a girl and had taken a total of 5 tabs over the course of the night. By this time our other two friends were ready to leave and go back home. Joe asks us to give him 30 more minutes while he takes this girl back to his truck to hook up with. We agree, since this guy never gets any ass, and we see him run off towards the bar grab a girl by the hand and out the door. Mind you it was very dark and smokey in the club.5:00 We stroll up to joe's truck and are spotted. We give him a few minutes to get his clothes back on and hop in the truck. I'm riding shotgun and my two friends are in the back. I decide to turn around and introduce myself to this girl after Joe says we are going to drop her off at her place on the way home. Now the first thing I usually notice about a girl are her eyes. In this case, it was her ADAM'S APPLE!!. Completly shocked and appalled I somehow manage to utter out the words 'How you doing?' In a deep shy voice he/she reply's 'Good'5:10 The ride home is silent. I look back to see my two friends edgeing away from the shemale towards the passenger side door.5:20 We drop 'It' off at her place and Joe gets it's number and gives it a kiss goodbye!5:21 We can't hold it any longer and burst out in laughter explaining to Joe that abomination was a dude. He quickly protests saying 'That was a girl, I checked' To which I replied 'Then you just hooked up with your first post-op tranny!'5:30 Joe drops us off at my place and before driving off says 'Ok, even if that was a dude, which she was not, don't tell anyone about it!'And so ends 'The Legend of Joe' The moral of the story? 'If your bi-curious and want to keep it a secret, don't take ecstacy while out with your friends' Ok, I don't know why I thought this would be a good idea.  I thought it would be something else I could do besides drinking that would keep me calm and not want to eat.  I have never done drugs but I have been drinking everyday almost for a year now.  But anyway!  Back to my brilliant idea of drinking DXM to get drunk.  I took about 12 tsp of DXM at about 10:30am and figured it would take about 30 minutes to kick in.  It is now noon and I am feeling the full effects of it.  I also drank a shot of vodka with diet coke when I did this.  My hands are shaking and I keep feeling like burning sensations all throughout my upper body and arms.  The burning sensation gets worse the more I move around.  I am not hungry, am a little nauseous.  And I really want this to be over now. Me and one of my friends took 30mg each of cyclobenzeprine, which was an extremely dissapointing expierience. I had taken klonapin in the past and was not a fan of benzos which it was much like. It just made me tired dissoriented, depressed and iritable. The effects lasted around ten hours and toward the end of what had been a miserable expirience, I drank some vodka which proved to be a good combo that was very dissorienting and a wonderful exscape from this shitty world we have the curse of living in.

We had done blow, had a QP of schwag, and an interesting idea came across my mind while searching for some T3's to knock me out one night after doing lines. I saw Effexor, and promptly took 2 75mg caps and put them in my pocket.Later that night, we went to a 'cafe' as they called it, which was essentially a bar/restaurante w/ a dance floor and a quality sound system. We had a few beers and I told him about the effexor, we both promptly took them, had a few more beers and I felt great! I felt like I was on ecstacy, sort of. Less tingley and connective tho.Now, drinking with medication isn't healthy, and I'm assuming its horrible for your liver. Well, to start of I'd say that I'm not a big opiate fan, got alot of friends hooked and never had urge to try it. I was out of pot but had a half bottle of vodka. I started drinking then I remembered I had two T-3's (30mg's a piece of codeine). I took them at around 10pm and drank the bottle. About 30 mins later I started to feel a little different.Then I started to scrape my pipe I've had for a while, and I got a really phat resin ball. I smoked it then, WOW, It hit me, a completley different high! It was pretty great, completely relaxed, mentally clear, and really gone at the same time! I was gone for about three more hours. Really good high no nausea or anything and I was on empty stomach. This is probably more of a retrospective/summary kind of experience submission.I first got drunk at 14, almost 15 years old.  I have to admit I really enjoyed it at first.  I only got drunk about 3 or 4 times after that, until about age 18, which is when I started going crazy once I got to college.Social situations.  That's how I got into alcohol.  I am not an alcoholic or anything but I can't say I don't at least partially question what I was doing with those blackouts, which I am humbled and embarassed to have 4 on my belt.  Not to mention damage to the brain and liver and stomach, which fortunately probably is not all that much compared to other people, since I only drank regularly for a little over a year.  And I almost never drank at all during the week.  The shit is just fucking gutrot.  Alcohol supposedly lowers inhibitions.  That's what made it so attractive to me - I was such an inhibited kid, but when I was drunk, I would suddenly become myself and actually started talking once in a while, making people laugh, etc.Don't be fooled.  It's a placebo effect.  A study was conducted in the University of Washington, where they fabricated a bar setting.  You know those 4-squared chemistry tables (I'm not too scientific)?  They did one like this:                   Got alcohol   Did not get alcoholWanted alcoholDid not want alcoholYup.  They actually observed what people did under these circumstances.  The ones who thought they were getting alcohol, and did, is pretty much an obvious outcome.  I don't think I need to cover that.  The ones who thought they were getting alcohol and did not?  Listen to me very carefully.  It was done with near bears and tonic water and such.  Somehow they can make it taste like it's alcohol, and when the barflies started drinking, they all spoke of the buzz they were getting, they all acted EXACTLY AS THEY WOULD WHEN DRUNK.  And their blood alc. content was nothing higher than .00000000%Those who did not think they were getting alcohol and did, acted sober...they thoroughly made certain that people wouldn't drink too much, but the people displayed no lowered inhibitions, impulse control was relatively the same... I am paraphrasing a lot but I am sure it's on the internet somewhere.When I learned about this, that was really what did it for me.  It made perfect sense to me.  I gradually started to act exactly the same when drunk, unless I was blacked out - in that case I was just fucking retarded.  I didn't know what was going on at first.  I often pushed myself, wanting to push my limits so I could get 'perfectly drunk' every time I started drinking.  A mistake among alcoholics - don't ever employ that psychology when drinking; it will lead to you blacking out, and you're just going to wake up confused and wondering who you pissed off last night.I will have a beer or a shot or two.  But two drinks remains my maximum.  I don't get much of a buzz, if one at all, and I don't care.  I'm happy that I'm not going to wake up with some shitty headache, all because I was stupid enough to think alcohol was actually contributing to me having fun.  Yeah right.For the most part, I've quit drinking.  Maybe sometime in the distant future I could consider it again but...I have precious little incentive to do so in a LONG time, if ever again.  The thought of getting drunk, knowing the unimaginable unhealthiness that alcohol embodies has disgusted me for a long time.  I don't know if I can disassociate from that.  I hesitate when offered one beer nowadays.  I do actually enjoy the taste of a good drink though.I know this is a cliched stoner thing to say, but it pisses me off that alcohol is the legal drug when clearly it is SO MUCH WORSE than marijuana or mushrooms.  I hate people.  I can't believe alcohol and nicotine are the legal drugs when it has been proven through in and through out that they're much more detrimental than marijuana or mushrooms.Is it worth the hangover?  Is it worth the risk of going down the wrong road?  Is it worth those poor unfortunate people on the highway who become victims of drunken driving?  Is it worth losing people like Chris Farley, or Bon Scott?  Do you guys remember how funny the movie Tommy Boy was?  Do you guys remember when ACDC was on the verge of unimaginable prominence and success, when Scott's unfortunate death at the hands of the bottle in 1980 suddenly ruined everything? Remind me again how many people have died from marijuana? The following all transpired when I got hired to deliver pizza. In true fun spirit (2nd year Uni didn't start for another two weeks, so any lost brain cells would have enough time to find their way home), I had to host a staff party at my house immediately (two weeks [post-training of course]) upon my acceptance to the world-class team of delivery experts. This was all lots of fun, but also a first time for the particular combination of chemicals I've listed above.      Firstly, everyone had been drinking casually since approximately 4:00PM during a river-floating trip we went on before the festivities at the house transpired. Now, another quick background explanation: I'd attended a staff party from a few towns West a week prior to my hosting of the Grand Event, which gave me a taste of the hardcore party capabilities within the lower-ranks of the pizza industry. At this first staff party to which I was present we'd enjoyed smoking from a Hooka (lookup the address of your nearest 'Persian Teahouse' for a taste of this radicalness) as well as ingesting some MDMA and whatnot (obviously whilst drinking as well) - so in short, I had a pretty good idea of what was taboo (which was not much incidentally [and also to my delight]) for said pizza crowd.       This preview allowed me to properly plan my own event for the crew back home. It turned out well, as pizza folks are oddly creative and artsy (which was cool since would soon partake in a favorite past-time of the very late Vincent Van Gogh), so we began to sing along with the commendable acoustic abilities of Brad, the guitarist... As I properly prepared (in the 'traditional Czech-slash-Slavic fashion' as specified on the back of the bottle of Hill's, which was easily procured at a government liquor shop in Vancouver, B.C. for the exclusive event) Absinthe to serve to my guests. This was quite successful except for the breaking of a couple nice martini glasses due to rapid temperature changes caused by the carmalizing sugar setting the minty-flavoured liquer ablaze and then dousing the flame with ice-water (the moral of this side-story is don't let it burn too long). Anyways, that was a cool tangent, but basically what we found to occur while under Absinth's influence, is that one's body gets drunk whilst her mind becomes clear or lucid (or 'nonopaque' for any of you radiologists reading this) and hyper-aware. It's as if I became mentally sober but physically messy, and not necessarily slurring my speech unless already super-drunk from previously-ingested booze.      Alright, we're on a roll now. On to substance of the night number two (or three for those keeping track). Good old Cannabis is what we smoked during that fine dusk-time, and lots of it. In the traditional (at least for recent generations) spirit of British Columbian's we definately inhaled its vapour and smoke without an unneccessary adulteration by crushed tobacco leaves (which many Europeans and Americans seem to enjoy). Of course marijuana cannot be simply neglected because of its seemingly harmless softness when compared with other mind-goodies. Finally, enter the pack-donkey of the fragile (a whole nother paper on this perhaps to come) Columbian economy, that which is derived from the leaves of the coca plant native to said nation: Cocaine. This mind-goodie is a real special one to me, personally. It has been a catalyst for a steadily increasing GPA (recently anyways) thanks to the all-night cramming binges it permits me to undertake. Cocaine makes me feel very empowered and clears my mind so that I can think, read, write, or speak at an inhuman pace and for a long time too. The only thing that can ruin the fabulous high it produces is the oft-rediculous 'come down' that follows said space-flight. I am currently suffering from the come-down that occurs post-euphoric cocaine experience - which (the come-down) feels quite enormous and somewhat unpleasant.Right now, as I'm scribbling in this inhuman digital manner (through a keyboard), I'm coming-down hard from at least thirteen lines (spread over a five hour time period) of fun with a handful of enlightened semi-new aquaintences. I feel somewhat aggravated, as well as completely incapable of sleep or ingesting any foodstuff whatsoever. For the person wallowing in the aforementioned tumble back to earth, sleep is something of  dream or hope, whilst the thought of eating is disgusting or at least unpleasant enough to cause the writer of this sentence to cringe as he writes this nearly-final sentance (don't worry, the end is coming soon). These effects though, are not quite as noticable when mixed with the other substances that I consumed that night. When mixed with a hefty level of liver-saturation by well-distilled wormwood (Absinthe), the effects of pure cocaine's stimulation are both lessened and enhanced simultaneously. Sounds funny I know, but in short, Absinthe plus blow equals a laid-back euphoria in which I might desire to live out the rest of my days. My fervent advocacy of climbing the chemical junglegym within the playground of the mind aside for a moment - this is dangerous! Just a subjective judgement obviously, and it doesn't mean I'll stop combining the two - in fact I look forward to it happening again, and again.      Now it's 7:14am on the morning after a good-sized binge and I'm getting tired of writing this. I need to sleep (but know I can't) because I've got a calculus lecture at 1:00pm today. I regret that I couldn't arrive at any revolutionary academic breakthrough with this script - but what can one really ask for in a narrative of events? Alright for starters I have a very high alcohol tolerance.  I have been know to take more than 20 beers/shots in a night and still act completely normal, so alcohol doesn't really affect me.  During the night my friend was telling me how benadryl will give him weird hallucinations like with good friends and such so I decided to try it.  I took 8 benadryl's about a half hour ago and I feel just drunker than where I started and start to feel a bigger buzz coming on. Its been about an hour and I feel like going to sleep.  I figure because of my size and relative tolerance to intoxicates benadryl will not affect me that much. I've done a good amount of drugs in my life and Oxycontin occasionally for the past few years.  I thought I knew what I was doing. Typically,  I never went over snorting 40mg.  One night, though, the horrific mistake I made was to cap off a half bottle of Crown before heading to a bar and, in my pregame drunkenness, chewed two 40mg oxy's.  Needless to say, by the time I got to the bar I'd had about 10 whiskey shots and the oxy, and I was hella fucked.  I drank even harder at the bar, an open bar will do it to me, and was blacked out drunk.  I was trying to dance with my girlfriend but was sketchily nodding off and shit ( she doesn't do anything) and then my buddy was dying to get down on one so I said I felt sick and left the bar.  I don't remember a thing after that, other than I woke up with the worst headache I've ever had.  Apparently Id snorted another 40mg.  It was a life changing morning. I and only I knew how close I came to an irresponsible and totally pointless death.  Perspective hit me like a goddam ton of bricks. First time I relaized what my body wanted, it felt as if it was a routine part of my day. I understood that I wanted it, but did not grasp the concept of addiction. I learned to rely on it, to depend on it any time I was drunk. It would normalize me.It brings a part of me that I am not normally bur nevertheless that I am. So it gives me a feeling of being confortable. Once it goes away from my body I understand the feeling of wanting and needing. My body is asking me for more, every time I get drunk my solution is to get high. It was a typical saturday night. A night with four 30 packs of beer with me and my buddies. We were drinking and my friend happened to have a prescription of 1mg Xanax. He brought them along. Now I never really messed with pills before, but I figured what the hell. I snorted two 1mg xanaxs and continued drinking beer. Well, I woke up the next morning next to an ex girlfriend. What I do remember is one of the best feelings in the world. Complete happiness. Just don't over do it people. I was one happy camper that night. Im now 18, male, middle class, normal etc. I have been drinking for about 3/4 years and smoking weed, ecstasy, lsd, poppers. A few months ago I went out with some friends to a club. I was in a relatively good mood and drinking casually ie. not drowning my sorrows/ trying to kill myself. I think I had about 7 or 8 double vodkas in the space of about an hour, I felt fine and was running around trying to 'pull'. My memory's pretty hazy but eventually I found myself getting off with a really attractive girl. Suddenly the vodka hit me in a bad way (before this I was feeling drunk but good), I didn't feel like I was going to throw up but I felt out of control, I was stumbling around and sweating etc. All this was fine if a bit unpleasant. I had a few ( I can't remember how many) more drinks with this girl (whose name I forget). Suddenly I became incredibly horny and I was basically groping this girl and pulling her towards the toilets trying to convince her to come and have sex in the  toilets with me, problem was I couldn’t speak. Next thing I remember I was on a toilet with the door unlocked with diarrhea and puking over and over in front of me, I think about 5 times. At this point I felt that I was going to die, no that’s wrong, I felt so bad that I wanted to die. I have never felt suffering as extreme as this before and I really think if someone had given me a gun I would have killed myself. I started crying as someone tried to open the door of the cubicle, I tried to tell them there was someone in here but they persisted and eventually got the door open (I didn’t lock it). It turned out the person trying to get in was a security guard. He thought I was taking drugs so he demanded that I stand up and empty my pockets. I couldn't and kept crying. He forced me up, with my trousers and pants down and covered in shit/puke and told me to empty my pockets I did so as best I could and all my stuff fell on the floor, he picked up the money and left with it, leaving my in the toilet. I blacked out for about another hour and then my friends carried me back to one of their houses. Later the next day on of my friends told me that the girl I was kissing had asked him to protect her from me.  I lost my's job over it, got in plenty of fights, fuck, I'm only eighteen. Alcoholism isn't fun, it isn't funny. Fuck the media glorifying it with the drunk charecter on tv. It's not kewl. Imagine your life a perpetual hangover, except when you're drunk, which will make you forget everything anyway. I'm drinking right now, I wish I wasn't, but I have to. I haven't seen more than five sober nights in the past three months, and those nights were hell. I get the shakes all day at work (not anymore, I lost my job)until I get a drink. I'm pissed off and anti-social sober, and a stupid rambling motherfucker when I drink. I have one friend who also happens to be a lush. I hate alcohol, but I love it. Alcohol never ceized to amaze me and I geuss after this day it never will.Lets start out by saying my family goes on a vacation to Ontario every year, it is a nice place and theres a lots of lakes to go fishing. Well one year my mother had brang 2 pint bottles of Southern Comfort Whiskey with her to the 'cabins' at which we reside. Well when my mother and my father went out fishing on the boat and left me at the 'cabin' with my brother and his friend, I headed in her room and decided to see what wonderful events some Southern Comfort could bring into my life. Well, I ended up drinking the whole one bottle and got close to halfway through the second when I was DONE drinking. I remember getting in my brothers car with him and is friend and we went out to the town and he talked to one of the friends he made in Ontario and I sat in the car. I remember it plainly, every detail. Or do I? Whenever my brother or my dad go on long trips such as a vacation, we always keep track of our mileage. After I sobered up my brother said that we never went any where and I thought he was just saying that to keep himself out of trouble when my parents got home but actually he wasn't lying. The mileage was the same as before I drank. Apparently I kicked the can opener around the floor for awhile until I got bored of that and ran outside and screamed 'im drunk' in front of a lot of people and made a complete ass out of myself and that was followed by jumping in the lake and my brother went and got me out before I drowned. I geuss he thought I deserved that much...to die sober. Then I geuss I passed out for the rest of the day and my mother layed in bed with me because she thought I was going to die of alcohol poisoning. But my mother was like that. Even though I AM suprised I didnt die. Well that was a pretty extreme experience and after that I figured I was never drinking again...but we all say that...until we get out to the liquor store.  DOSE: \\xa0 repeated oral Alcohol (liquid) \\xa0 \\xa0  oral MDMA (pill / tablet) \\xa0 \\xa0 repeated smoked Cannabis (plant material)Two very close friends and I were staying in a large rented caravan/mobile home for four nights at a small campsite in the New Forest area of England.  The village we stayed in is a tiny, picturesque location complete with a nice country pub and village green, which is occupied by a few wild horses during the day.  Despite coming here twice before, we still thought of ourselves as strangers in this small, isolated, rural community.  It kind of reminded me of old Western films where three horsemen would arrive in a small outback town, causing suspicion and edginess amongst the locals.  Except our horses were bikes – we were there to go mountain biking in the surrounding forest area, you see. Now I’ve set the scene, let’s get down to the fun part – the night in question.  We started the evening getting slightly drunk in the caravan and smoking a few joints.  We then headed down to the village pub where we proceeded to drink some more (Jack Daniel’s as I remember), and make acquaintance with the local laydeez of the village.  Once closing time came we all headed to a house party just down the road from the pub and somehow managed to blag our way in.  There was talk going round of a geezer hanging around outside selling ecstasy, and my friend and I wasted no time in obtaining some of these pills.  Once we had these pills in our hands we began to get quite apprehensive.  It was to be the first time for both of us but there was no going back now so we downed them and had some cheap wine.  Roughly half an hour later, the effects were getting quite noticeable for me and I had the sudden urge to start dancing like a maniac in the middle of the living room floor of this guy’s house who I didn’t even know.  My friend at this point was in the bathroom doing I don’t know what so I went into the garden for some fresh air and a brief sit down.  There were some dogs in the garden running around in an enclosed fenced area, and I was getting bored waiting for my friend still in the bathroom, so I decided to ‘feed’ the dogs.  This involved me carrying armloads of canned dog food from the fridge inside out into the garden to hurl into the dog area.  And this is where it all started to get a bit surreal.I remember making my way out into the front garden of the house and seeing a police car pull up outside.  This brought on a sudden, intense wave of paranoia in me and being the first person he saw, the police officer strolled up to me and started asking questions about noise levels, shouting, things like that.  I blabbered my way through this interrogation with some ease and the officer went inside.  At this point the paranoia really started to creep in.  I had a feeling that everyone was looking for me, for punishing me for every bad thing I had ever done in my life.  Although this might sound like a bad trip to you, I was actually enjoying it as I felt like a James Bond character – everybody looking to kill him, but always staying one step ahead.  The adrenalin rush was like no other I had ever experienced.I was feeling overwhelmed by all the action and so I went back to our caravan alone to get some more weed to mellow me out a bit.  I did this ok but upon returning to the party I decided not to go back in but to head opposite to the village green instead, and watch the action from a safe viewpoint all by myself.  I sat under a tree in total darkness and began to roll and smoke a few joints.  After two joints I remember babbling incoherently like a fool and I must have collapsed or something.I awoke and looked at my watch – it was 5am.  I headed back to the caravan where my friends were fucking around with the TV set or something and I sat down calmly.  I then burst into a full rendition of most of my favourite songs and went to bed.  The singing was especially satisfying as I was feeling like a rock star or something, and that was good.  I like singing when I’m wasted anyway.So that’s that.  The next day I didn’t feel too bad, didn’t have a hangover, felt quite good actually, but a bit sick.  I’m surprised I can remember so many details of this night but it was all good, like a chapter out of “Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas”. Well last night was prom at my school and to stay awake all night without doing uppers I decided to drink the Molson kick beer, which contains about 3g of guarana per bottle. So in all I took in about 18 grams of this shit and man does it get you fucked! I was soo wired all night even though I had to walk for an hour to get to the party, which didn't start till 1:00 or so, I was grinding my teeth and talking codshit to strangers all night. It was almost hallucinogenic, like MDMA, but it kept me up until at least 6:00. I did do a small line of coke which didn't do too much seeing as I was already fucked.. All in all it was totally worth it if you'd rather drink to stay awake than sniff a bunch of lines of drop a couple pills.

I am a straight A college student majoring in Computer Science, two years into my degree.  I have 4 brothers, 1 sister, two parents, and a 19-year-old cousin all living in the same house.  Thus far, my parents have been unaware of my drug use, but they have been suspicious at times.  Now their worst fears were confirmed and I lost a lot of respect.  They still love me, but I don't think they will ever view me the same way again.I had just stolen some Vicodin pills from my Grandma (she has a bottomless prescription) and had a prescription for Klonopin and Celexa for 'anxiety' (that I didn't have).  I am only 20 and had trouble getting alcohol, so I bought some mouthwash.  Now it was a Friday and I did not have to work that night.  I planned to trip hard on some allergy pills.  I didn't know what to expect as I had never taken the combination I was planning on.  I'm not sure why I took the Celexa, but I felt that the Vicodin and Klonopin would help with the uncomfortable side effects and make it more of a journey.  Boy was I in for a journey!6:00 p.m. I down 30 mg Vicodin (along with the unfortunate but necessary 1500 mg tylenol).  10 minutes later I am beginning to feel very good.  So good in fact, that my judgement begins to weaken.  I suddenly think it would be a good idea to take the Klonopin.  I take one pill.  I wait about 1 minute (!!) impatiently and take another... then another.  I don't notice anything.  My guess is that the Klonopin snuck under the Vicodin and merely weakened my judgement further.  Not to be foiled (I wanted to trip!), I thought it would be a good idea to go into the bathroom and drink some mouthwash.  I downed about 3-4 oz.  For some reason I didn't mind the taste at all.  Then I pop 4 Celexa... without even thinking.6:30 p.m.  My parents ask me if I want to go shopping at Costco with them.  I was feeling so good and free that I made the very bad mistake of saying 'sure!'  The ride there felt great.  We walked into the store and I'm rolling a bit.  I was having a bit of trouble keeping my balance.  I told my parents I'd go look in the computer aisle (so I could get away from them).  I was walking around the computer aisle and ALL-OF-A-SUDDEN, out of NOWHERE, I throw up all over myself.  I had sat down very quickly before it came out, but couldn't keep the vomit in.  So now I'm in the computer aisle at Costco with vomit all over me and spreading over the floor.  I used to work there for a year so SOME OF THOSE PEOPLE KNEW ME!!But I didn't care.  I was high on vicodin, klonopin, and alcohol.  I was numb, carefree, and happy.  I said I was sick and like a cow just waited for them to wipe me up.  I wasn't thinking that my vomit must've smelled strongly of mouthwash!7:30Home again, and I'm still feeling great.  I decide it's time to take the Benadryl (NOOOOOOOO!!!!!).  I get out my big Costco-sized bottle and start surfing, reading stories about people tripping.  I go to a movie website and read about some movies.  I pop 8 pills.  About 5 minutes later, I pop 5 more.  Then another 5.  I'm still feeling great, and beginning to feel the allergy-pill high like I never have before.  I go upstairs and drink 2 doses of Nyquil, and a little more mouthwash.  I then go back downstairs and surf the internet popping benadryl.  I had lost control, but I was so fucked up I didn't realize it at the time.  I kept forgetting how much I took, but felt so good that I just kept popping more.This is where my memory STOPS and I don't remember A THING!!!  That is a VERY SCARY feeling.My cousin says he found me leaning over a tall dresser in our basement.  He poked me and I just mumbled 'ehhh I'm fiinne'.  Not being familiar with my drug use, he left me for a few minutes.  When he came back, I was crumpled in a heap on the CONCRETE floor (OW!!).  He was unable to arouse me.  He got my parents and they decided to immediately rush me to the hospital.  My breathing was very, very ragged and shallow, and my pulse was faint.  Not wanting my younger brothers to know about this, my parents put me in our van and take me to the hospital as quickly as they can.  My parents tell me I was completely out for over 5 hours.  Then I started waking up several times, but I don't remember any of those at all.  The only thing I remember was the last time I woke up, and they were asking me stupid questions,'Where are you?''In the hospital!  (duh!)''Which hospital?''[names correct hospital easily]''What's your name?''[says name]'Well apparently I had woken up many times and kept saying gibberish.  One time I said it was too early to go to school (ha ha!)  It is now about 4:00 a.m. in the morning, my throat is extremely dry, my dick is VERY sore (which it would be for a couple weeks--DAMN CATHETERS!), and I am too numb to even care.  I stumble out of the hospital bed and back into our van and they start asking me questions.  I hide all my previous drug use and say it was an 'accident'.  I'm still quite messed up but sober enough to understand them now.  They tell me my stomach had been pumped and I tested positive for FOUR different kinds of drugs!  Opiates, Alcohol, Klonopin, and Celexa (it didn't catch the benadryl, apparently).   I get nervous and mention those were my prescriptions, still trying to hide my drug use... pure futility.  They found the open allergy pill bottle next to where I passed out, with pills next to it (presumably, I kept taking them until I passed out... I do not remember this).I have now come clean with my parents about all my drug use, and have gained some respect back.  I have a ways to go, but I am cleaning up my act and I will now look to meditation and healthy forms of altering consciousness instead of drugs.  I have learned that drugs are only a path to Satan's doorstep... they are so easy; they take no effort.  My parents said the doctors told them I was in very serious condition and could've gone into cardiac or respiratory arrest, especially if I was not found as early as my cousin found me and had my stomach pumped.  Please, if you are going to alter your consciousness with drugs, plan beforehand and HIDE any drugs that you may want to take while UNDER THE INFLUENCE.  It almost KILLED ME! The first time I took shrooms was interesting but because of an idiotic mistake that I made to drink, I fucked it up.  My friend and I had took the bus to a friend's house and when we got there my friend Curt had already drinken a substancial amount.  When we got to Annie's house she told me that she had shrooms but only enough for 1 more person.  Curt said that he would just drink so I decided to eat the shrooms (5 stems and 1 cap).  When we got to her house, we just chilled and listened to music for a while.  Curt started to get really drunk while we were there.  He started rambling on and on about dumb shit.  Then Annie suggested that we take a walk and go smoke a bowl.  We ended up walking over to a church parking lot where Curt got on his knees and was praying underneath the shadow of the cross.  We smoked a couple bowls, then kicked it for about 20 minutes.  The shrooms had not started to hit me yet and being stupid, I didn't think that I ate enough so I decided to drink a little.  I had about 3 swigs of Skyy Berry Vodka.  We went back to her house and thats when the shrooms hit me hard.  We started talking abou the jelly that held the stars in place and how when you reached into the open air, you could feel the jelly.  Then I sat down on the bed and it felt as if the bed accepted me when I touched it.  Then I leaned back against the wall and it felt as if it pushed in to accept my weight.  Annie and I laughed at Curt as he begin to pass out and make weird noises.  Then she talked about how she was shrinking and that the room was getting bigger.  Then I looked at my hand underneath a blue light and i could see the five points of the body on my hand and the each formed a mountain on a finger.  Curt said I was an idiot and Annie laughed, but I really saw these 5 different bumps on my hand and they all had a different color.  We walked into Annie's brother's room to watch a movie and Curt passed out after about 3 minutes.  When the movie started, I was trippin' on the shadows it made on the walls. I took about 3 more swigs of vodka ands then her mom walked in with the bottle of rum that was in her room.  She wanted us to leave and she had the bottle in her hand.  Annie woke Curt up and when he saw the bottle, he told her mom, 'No thanks, I'm good.'  She laughed and asked us why were drinking and Curt went on to tell her how he was a straight 'A' student.  When we left she gave me the bottle and Annie walked us to the door.  The two of us stumbled down the street and Curt mumbled things but could not understand them.  I felt this extreme shame for being kicked out of Annie's house and for some reason my mind told me to drink more.  I took about 5 swigs of the rum then slammed the bottle in the street.  Curt was walking down the street like a zombie from the game Resident Evil.  I was looking into the trees and I kept seeing these dark triangles that would turn to a dark green then fade away. Now by this point, things started to get sketchy but I remember being in the parking lot of the mall.  I kept begging Curt to call a cab and he stumbled over to Starbucks to make the call.  I walked over and saw this group of people and screamed at them when they looked at me.  I told them, 'Fuck you, I'll beat all your asses.'  Then I took off running into the bushes and begin to see thing move.I swear that I was watching these shadows about the size of a cat just stare at me.  I assumed that they were little shadow creatures but I felt safe with them.  Curt yelled at me and said to get my ass over there and for some reason I ran.  It felt as if all the little creatures were running behind me as if they were following me.  Then I saw a bush and ran full speed into it in a football tackle style.  I lay there with my pants fallen down and a girl in a car leaned out and asked if I was O.K., I said yes and even though I knew that I was not, I decided to say it because it felt like a movie script.  All night, no matter what happened, it did'nt surprise me because it felt like it was all a movie script.  The next thing I know, this car pulls up next to me and Curt and this guy named Jeff get out and Curt had sobered up somewhat.  They told me that Curt told them I did shrooms and they were gonna take me home.  I asked them several times if they were cops and they laughed and told me no.  In the car Curt was looking at me with this mad look on his face and told me I was stupid.  This seemed to enrage me and I told him to fuck off and that I wasn't scared of him.  Then for some reason I swung at him and hit him in the face.  He said stop and I told him to do something.  I hit him about 3 more times in the head before Becky (the girl who was driving) asked me to stop and I somewhat came to my senses and I said OK.  They dropped us off at Rite Aid which was about 1/2 mile or so from my house.  When we got out, I tried to walk but couldn't.  Curt told me he was going to get change for calls and to get me something to drink.  I dont remember this part but this is what he told me.  He said that when he came back, my pants had fallen down and I was sitting down throwing up on myself.  He was begging for me to get up and he kicked me in the face and then in the ribs.  He told me that I had to get up and that my dad was coming. Apparently, he had called my aunt who I live with and told her that someone slipped something in my drink at a party and that my dad needed to come get us.  I remember when my dad pulled up, I saw him get out and laugh and he just said, 'What did he take?'  Curt told him and he just said to get in the car.  When I got in I told him I was so tired and so cold and then I opened my wallet and threw money at him.  I told him that there was $150 dollars and I didntr= care if he spent it all.  He took me home and Curt and I slept in the car.  The next day I spent puking all day.  All in All in was a bad combo. I read a report about an individual seeing 'trails' for a brief period in the morning which they claimed was caused by paroxetine. I thought it worthwhile to report that I have also had a similar experience, one which was not identical but still had evident connotations with LSD. I was on Paroxetine (It's called Arropax here is Australia, I believe its Paxil in the US), 80mg per day. Anywho, I had never done acid before I was on this SSRI but thought 'what the fuck?' and took a hit (this was about 2mths ago). Since then I have only done it about 4 other times. It was good, very enjoyable.About 2 weeks after my last hit, my shrink swapped the paroxetine for fluvoxamine maleate (Luvox in Australia, 300mg a day), a different SSRI.I found that when I drank heavily, say a 750ml bottle of vodka in a sitting, the next morning when I woke up I could see a subtle but very real rippling effect on what ever surface I looked at. It was very reminicent of acid, as this effect was one of the most pleasant and vivid aspects of my previous trips.This would wear off in about five minutes. I did notice, however, that this effect was at its most prominent on the third morning of drinking a bottle a night for three nights (vodka, bicardi, vodka). I don't know what caused this, and neither does my shrink, really (although I'm sure he knows more than he'd let on ;) This happened to me last week, and if i don't write it down now I'll probably forget.I'd been looking forward to our class party for a while now, i've recently started college, and people who study computer science are introverted to say the least, so I planned on just getting a bit tipsy and making some friends. But there was a problem - cash. My employers had failed to pay me that week, so I had €5 for the night. Half of that went on dinner, the rest on a pint. Anyways, before the party (in a city centre night club) I drank one can of miller. I dont drink much so my tolerance is low. I was mildly merry. In the club I had 2 more pints within 15 minutes of each other. It was still early, about 10pm, and I was out of money. And slightly drunk. I was waiting for my friend to come on and dj, but the dj before him was playing well over his time slot. I began to get impatient, and remembered that my friend Cian had a wrap of Ketamine. He had mentioned in passing earlier on that day that he might do some at the party. So I approached him, and he was more than willing to accomodate. He went into a cubicle and did a line, then handed me the wrap, whrereupon myself and another friend, Alan followed suit. We opened the wrap, and in turn scooped out a fairly minimal amount each on a 5 cent piece, and sniffed it. I hadnt planned on getting too fucked, I was just hoping the K would add a comical and slightly odd tinge to the next half hour. Was I in for a surprise...It turned out to be pure, uncut Ketamine. The fact that I had been drinking meant it affected me a lot more than it did Cian or Alan. It took about a minute or two to kick in. At first it felt like the head buzz you sometimes get from a hefty bong hit. Then, well, it was just ketamine. I find it very difficult to accurately describe the sensation. It's just like a complete narcotic overhaul on the mind. Symptoms this time included almost complete loss of sensory perception, inability to comprehend music, blurred vision, loss of any sense of time, impaired motor skills and mild hallucinations.I also felt slightly paranoid. the night was supposed to be a social endeavor; i wanted to get to know people, maybe try it on with that hot chick in my class. There was no way I could possibly approach anyone. I stumbled over to Cian at one stage, grabbed him by his bony shoulders and yelled 'Im completley fucked!' into his ear. It took a huge amount of effort to get these words out, and I would have liked to be able to descibe the effects precisely and more eloquently to him, but I couldnt think straight. Even after I said this I could hear it echoing inside my brain, as if said by someone else. Everybody's face looked like an exaggerated caricature of themselves, my friends appeared as if in a dream, all their features accentuated.Once my friend took over from the previous dj, and I came a little bit back down to earth, i started dancing. I still couldnt tell one tune from another; the pounding techno beats were enough to keep me going. i remember lurching up to the dj box at one stage and requesting a track, but he told me that he had just played it. i had no idea.In retrospect, Im surprised at myself that Id be so irresponsible to drink alcahol and take K. However, the only adverse affect was the stinging in my nose, obviously caused by the crystalline ketamine. For several months, I had been having problems with my brother and the way he was acting, mostly toward other members of the family. He and I have always been the absolute closest, but shortly after his marriage, he started retreating away from the family and began to act annoyed, arrogant, and selfish toward me and my wife. I knew that I needed to talk with him about it, but I also knew that he wasn't one to talk very much.So I knew that this would call for ethanol. I invited him out to the local tavern and we sat and I started the conversation. I told him all the grievances that we (the other members of the family and I) had about him and his wife. He didn't say a word. He sat and clenched his jaw and looked away. Soon, our beer came and we started drinking. I knew he was frustrated with all of it, but it had to end before something worse happened.He finished his beer and didn't want anything else. I asked if perhaps he would like some Southern Comfort, and he said, 'Sure!' So I ordered some single-malt Scotch for myself and the Southern Comfort for him, and the night went on. After about two of his drinks, he finally started to let it out. He had his list of grievances, too, and I was ready to hear them. He was frustrated and angry about so many things, but didn't see a way out.He had never spoken like this before. When he finished, I told him that I would do everything I could to fix my end of the problem and that he should take care of his. He agreed to do whatever it took to solve the problems.He rarely comes out and says what he thinks, but when he does, it always makes things better. I am so grateful to have a brother like him, and you can imagine what horrible things happen when somebody that close begins to slip away. I was fortunate that he was in a drinking mood that night, as the Southern Comfort really loosened his lips. He was able to tell me everything right to my face and was not ashamed to say it. He had some bad things to say, but when they came out, we were one step closer to being reconciled.When it was all done, we hopped in the car, I lit up a smoke and then we listened to the Zombies for a couple songs and then I dropped him off at his place. I went home, forgot to drink water, talked it all over with my wife, and then went to sleep. I had one of the worst headaches in the world and I had to work all day that day.In the end though, all the family matters have been handled, we are together frequently and there are no hard feelings, now that it is all in the open. My brother's a great guy. He's quiet and shy and that can cause problems, but nothing that ethanol can't help with. In the past getting drunk was not to enjoyable for me.  Although I never got sick, the 'high' consisted of extreme dizziness and nausiousness.  So I was a bit uneasy about drinking again this night.  My 3 freinds and I decided to have a campfire and get a little happy to celebrate a great summer.  With no school hookups it was hard getting herb, but tonight my freind had got some from a brother in law.  It was a small portion, (about a dime) but we were not worried for we also had a bottle of Jamaican Rum  in our possesion.  We began the night drinking (drink then smoke toke toke toke. Smoke then drink, puking in the sink, or the woods in our case that night) We mixed the Rum with sprite and it wasn't bad.  I played Bartender that night and i made all the drinks half rum and half Sprite.  They were dixie cups 12 oz, so it wasn't much.  I think we had had low tolerances because after one drink and a few shots each, we were feeling it.  The buzz was very happy and we were put into extreme relaxation and mood lift.  Then it was time for the herb.  We each took about 2 hits, and then took about 5 resin hit each, which were very plentiful.  The feeling was amazing.  It wasn't a sloppy nausious high like I forecasted.  Instead, it was very mind expanding.  I felt like i was under an ancient spell, and I babbled poetry all night.  It was very psychedelic too.  We visited my shed and all made drum music as i chanted 'Cerenbelenj, What is GOD?' I was fixated with the notion of good and everything that night seemed to hit my brain deep.  It was a great high and the level of mind expansion was out of this world.  I had a blast! I had begun my night like usual, drinking beers at my friends house. I was getting a good buzz when I heard that someone we knew was selling pills of morphine for 2$ a pop. I had never tried it before so I decided to take one with my friend. I had already drank about 4 beers at this time, so I was a little worried about mixing the two. The guy said it would be fine, so we took the pill. Very soon after I felt it. It was very relaxing, but not very strong at all. We continued drinking beers until I had had about 8 beers. By this point we could barely feel the pill so I decided to try one more. After the second pill was down, I was really feeling good. I had a great body fry and felt really relaxed. The night had gone very smoothly, so I decided I would watch some tv. Soon I was pretty tired so I went to my bed.For some reason I wasnt able to fall asleep. At about 3:00 in the morning something weird started happening. I started getting a very strong head rush, and it was scaring me because I didnt know why it was happening so late after I took the pills. I started to feel very dizzy as well. Once I made it to the bathroom I looked in the mirror. My pupils were very very small and my face was very white. I then started sweating uncontrollably. By this point I was starting to panic and wondering if I should call 911. I figured I would just wait it out though. The last thing I experianced was nausea. I came close to vomiting but never actually did. After only about 20 minutes this bad experiance was over, and I headed back to bed and went to sleep. This night was fun up until that point, and that was enough to make me never want to take morphine again Last night I decided to get very drunk for the first time. I had never gotten drunk before this. Almost everyone at my age (I am 16) has been drunk before, so I decided to give it a try. I have tried other drugs before. I smoke alot of pot, I've done mushrooms, half a hit of lsd, and tripped Robotussin twice. I wanted to get drunk, but I did not want to be throwing up. I decied to do it after my parents and brother went to bed. I decided to take 6 shots of vodka.It was 1:30 before my parents and brother went to sleep. I took the bottle out of my parents stash of alcohol thinking they wouldnt miss one bottle. I took my six shots by about 2 am and there was about a quarter of a bottle left. I decided that it was fairly pointless to leave the bottle a fourth full so I finished it. In a bout half an hour I started to feel really messed up. Everything I was watching on the tv was extremely enjoyable. I began to get extremelly tired so I decided to head upstaris. Walking was very interesting. I didn't really stumble but it was not easy to walk. I walked into my bathroom and did the dumbest thing I did in a year. I reached for the drinking glass but I knocked into the sink breaking it. So I through the bottle away and then took the empty bottle out to the trash.I went to sleep at about 3am. I woke up at 11 am and was still feeling extremely messed up. I guess that I have a low tolerance for alcohol. Much too my disapointment my mom was still homw when I got up. I guess she had to go to a denist appointment. I said hi and walked into the kitchen. I dont think that she thought I was drunk. There no milk in the kitchen to make some cereal so I decided to take a shower. I got very dizzy in the shower and had to sit down a couple of times.I was wondering how long the effects of the alcohol would last. After mentally reveiwing the effects of last night I realized it is difficult to remember things when under the effects of alcohol. The whole night seemed like it happened in the course of a half an hour. After I got out of the shower I was feeling alright so I cleaned up the house and talked to a few of my friends online. Its 2:20 now and im still feeling the effects. I did not think it would this long. The only thing I am worrried about is that I have to go to a guitar lesson at 4:00. I hope I am down then because I dont really wanna drive drunk.Alcohol was definetely enjoyable, but I think I would rather do it at a time when I didn't have to be at home. It lasts quite long. Its been about 11 and a half hours now. It lasts almost 4 times longer than pot. I usually come down from marijuana in about 3 to 4 hours. I guess its just going to be an interesting day. Overall it was an enjoyable experiment. 7:30pm - Arrive at B's place, all excited to see my bro and have a big night. I wander into his room and say g'day, and he's in there with G (his girl) and L who's a friend of all of ours. L's asleep on the floor... aparrently she had a pretty big one last night. I sit and have a chat, and we start getting ready to go out.8:30pm - I've been at B's place for an hour now, and I'm not stoned... strange. I've just bought some buds from him and I'm chopping up. B, G and I have been catching up on the past, and there's plenty of stories to tell cause it's been a good 8 months since we've seen each other. I drop a little spin into this weed and fire up a bowl. Punch one, two then three, sit back and keep chattin. B tells me he's got some pills... I'm keen, it has been a while. But they're K pills, so I decide not to touch them, cause we're going clubbing.9:00pm - Damn, this is some mad assed weed :D I'm wrecked at this point, but still buzzing to go out. I'm getting ready, doing my hair and shit, and B is doing the same. L has woken, and has decided to come out with us. Another girl, A, has arrived, and I'm having a little chat with her. She's a good friend who I also haven't seen in a very long time, so I'm really happy to see her. 10:30pm - By this time we're at the club. It's pretty quiet but I'm told it doesn't get going until later. I'm talking to the barman who is an old mate of mine and catching up. We've been invited to an afterparty in a shack out of town, so we're all up for that. We won't be heading out there until late though, so I'm trying to enjoy myself as much as I can here. B and myself each did a depth charge (shot of tequila/drambui (I use tequila) and a middie of beer, drop the shot in, glass and all, and skull the lot) and I've had a few bourbons. The weed is wearing off from earlier... I'm still a bit stoned but the few quick drinks is perking me up.12:00am - B tells me he can hook up some MDMA pills and a weight of gas. White mitsubishi's and just some street speed. I buy 2 pingers from his hookup (M, also an old mate) and down them both at once, followed by a shot of tequila and another bourbon and coke, then I go the speed. I didn't take it all, left about 1/4 weight. I'm quite optimistic about the night :)12:30am - Pills are starting to work and the club is starting to fill. It's saturday night so it's not going to be huge, but people are starting to come through. The DJ is going pretty hard, so I go up and have a little dance. At some point in the night I have met up with E, another old friend, and her and I have a little dance and a chat and all that. Feeling good :)1:30am - Been wandering around talking to everyone. Managed to meet the guy who's afterparty we were going to, he just walked up to me and goes 'oi, you wanna come to my party?' and I go 'ah, i think i already am!' All sweet, shook hands and said I'd see him at the party. I've been meeting up with mates all night, so most of my time has been spent talking. I've met a few new people too, couple of girls that know my mates, and we've been talking too. Nice cruisy evening.2:00am - Club is winding up and we're heading out. Went and congratulated the DJ on his set (I always do that if they're good and I'm rolling hehe), said seeya to the people I'd met up with through the night and headed off. Got a lift with some chick who's name escapes me.3:00am - We've been at this party for a while and I'm a little disappointed. I expected it to be big, but there were probably about 20 people there. I've been smoking cones in the living room, and wandering around talking to people. There's been this one chick, C, who was really cool - we chatted for a while. And another chicky, but again I can't remember her name.3:30am - The barman, B2, has arrived at the party and we're chatting away. I suddenly get the urge for more drugs, so I go and grab B. He happens to have some of those K pills left so I take one. B2 and myself and the second chick from the last paragraph head out to his car and we chop the pill up and snort it. The bloke who owns the house is running around with a fucking snake. I am scared to death of snakes, and he waves the fucking thing in my face. I nearly had a fucking heart attack... I'm sitting on a couch out in the back room with B trying to recover from the scare.4:00am - Starting to feel pretty nice... nice enough that I buy another K pill and drop it. And this is where the story takes a rather interesting turn.----------------Ok I'm going to interrupt here. This is the point where I lost COMPLETE track of time, so anything from here on in happened between 4:30am and 6:30am, however I cannot vouch for the actual times OR the order in which this all happened. This hour or two also felt much, MUCH longer than that. And now, back to our feature presentation:----------------Around 4:15am - I'm floored. I'm sitting on a couch, but I don't know where I am. All I know is that B is sitting a few feet away from me, mixing tunes. I'm sure I'm in a room, but am I really sure? I keep looking around but I can't see properly. The walls are kind of there but not there. This is not vivid acid-style hallucinations of movement and colour... this is different. The walls are moving and changing colour, but not in an acid kind of way. Things just don't look right. I keep lifting my feet into the air... for what reason, I do not know.Tunnels start appearing around me... similar to the warp thingy in that TV show 'Sliders' - these tunnels in space are opening up all over the room. But, there's only one at a time... it just keeps shifting. I keep reaching for it but it moves. It finally fixes itself on the window across the room from me, where I can't reach it. I'm too smashed to get up, so I give up. Strangely, the tunnel disappears.I discover I have a cigarette in my hand... it feels kinda big though. I look at it, and it's not there... neither is my hand! WHOA! I look back and it looks normal... if not a little wobbly and kinda moving... and I decide not to try and make an explanation for what just happened :) I have a few drags on my smoke and it feels like I'm sucking on a toilet roll, the ciggy feels huge! Very similar to when you go to the dentist, that lingering anaesthetic feeling in your mouth was all over my body. I notice that everything does this... the smoke feels big in my hand, and if I stick my fingers into my mouth they feel like an entire arm. Cool :)B comes and sits with me, and for some reason the first thing out of my mouth was 'I think I need to take a shit... but I can't get up. I wonder if I'll shit myself?' B assures me that I'll be fine, and goes back to mixing. I sit and trip for a while, have another ciggy, and realise that I'm still lifting my legs up all the time. I've got this overwhelming sensation that the floor is trying to eat me... I can't SEE it, but I know it's true.I remember talking to B for a while, and only being able to say about 1 in every 5 words... so 'Man you're doing a great job on the decks' would come out like 'Man... job......... decks!!' I was so fucking retarded! I remember getting some wierd looks from B during this conversation :) I also was blurting out random phrases, the most common being 'SWEET JESUS, LOOK AT THAT!!' which I think may have been planted subliminally by watching Fear and Loathing too many times. My god, I was wasted.I call out to B and he comes over and sits back down. I say to him 'Uh, dude... I think I shit myself!' B assures me again that I'm fine and goes back to the decks, but I'm not convinced. I spend the next 10 minutes sticking my hand down my pants and smelling it. I hadn't shit myself, but I was 100% POSITIVE that I had.At this point B comes back over and sits down, telling me that all is sweet and I'll be fine. I spent the next 20 minutes or so on the couch with him convincing me that I hadn't shit myself. I keep saying shit like 'dude do I smell funny' and stuff, and he kept saying 'no dude, you're fine!'One of the girls I was talking to before comes in and offers me a cone, and all I can say is 'No thanks, I've just shit my pants.' She looked at me REALLY strangely, then slowly backed out of the room. She kind of stayed away from me from then on :)After an unaccountable period of time, I am sober enough to stand. Daylight has just broken and the clouds were a MAJOR tripout. I was still not 100% convinced that I hadn't shit myself, so I wander into the dunny and check. Nope, nothing there. Dammit, I'd made an arse of myself (scuse the pun) for nothing! Ah well, there's always next time :DI spend the next hour smoking cones with C (who thankfully hadn't heard about my statement earlier) and wondering where that other chick went... most probably to get as far from me as possible :)7:00am - We're sobering up good now, but I am SCATTERED AS! We've got a lift home so we're off. We say goodbye to everyone and jump in the car. We get home, have some cones, and pass out. I aquired exactly 30 mg of 4-HO-DiPT (as a white powder) and divided it up by eye into three piles of ~10 mg each.  I was very precise with this, so I am pretty confident that the piles were equal.  Also, I knew it probably wouldn't hurt if I was off by a mg or two with this drug, so dividing by eye was prefered.The night began at a party (with few people I didn't know).  I had been happy to be back in town for a few days, so I figured it'd be a grand time to do some psychedelics.  I got out 10 mg of 4-HO-DiPT and put it into my drink.  A few people knew I was doing the drug (and they were not leaving), so they could help if something went wrong.  I put the 10 mg in my beer, shook it around a bit and drank it.  It tasted slightly bitter, but it wasn't horrible.After I'd finished about 3 beers I noticed a different feeling (other than alcohol intoxication), kind of a rush type feeling.  I talked with friends and basically got drunk the rest of the night.  I was being a bit more talkative than normally when I drink and that was about all I noticed until later.  It wasn't until I was pretty damn soused that I noticed anything from the 4-HO.  I closed my eyes and saw brilliant patterns.  Fractals of rounded squares.  Simply amazing checkerboard-ish patterns twinkling, all light-blue and orange on a black background.  I kept my eyes closed until something external caught my attention and then I was off to drunk land again.  The rest of the night is pretty hazy and I don't remember much (too much alcohol).  That's about it.  I'd like to take it without other drugs next time. One night I was browsing online because I had nothing better to do and I came across a few reports of people getting a 'mild buzz' off 5-HTP. Well seeing as I had 5-HTP and nothing better to do I decided to take a bunch. I popped 12 50mg capsules and within 45 mins I felt slightly out of it. About an hour and a half after taking them I felt considerably messed up and quickly got bored of this very pukey buzz. Normally I would have just smoked some pot to feel better but seeing as I didn’t have any I decided to jus get realy friggin drunk and try to forget about it......HUGE mistake. I’m a 16 year old kid I have absolutley no tolerance to alchohol, I can get pretty drunk off 5 beers. After beer number 4 I was completely gone, the buzz was a lot different then just drinking without the 5-HTP. After my 7th beer my nausea had completely vanished and I had become 'zombified' for lack of a better word. For some reason I jus couldn’t stop drinking. I remember throwing up at one point then I just started drinking again (I don’t know what the hell I was thinking). Anyway I woke up in the hospital, my mom was there, she was pretty pissed at me. I havent had a beer since I never again wanna drink. This was by far the most horrible experience of my life. This is not a description of a single experience but more of a lifestyle I've developed. I'm only 22 but I'm a severe alcoholic. There's hardly a day that goes by that I don't drink. I'm kinda drunk right now actually and its the afternoon.I've known I had a problem for a while but didn't want to admit it. I'm young and in college its what people my age do, right? I counted one week and I figured I had drank about 2 and a half liters of vodka and 2 cases of beer. I routinely drink fifths of hard liquor in a night usually more. I fall down, knock things over, black out, and get in fights all the time.I think about drinking constantly I even dream about it. I've tried other drugs mainly pot and all kinds of pills, but they've never taken a hold of me like alcohol does. I feel like shit when I don't drink, I get depressed and anxious at the same time. I even get the shakes after a several day drinking binge.I want to stop but its so hard. I know I'm going to lose everything. My girlfriend will probably leave me if I don't cut down. My mom knows I'm a drunk and has to hide her pills from me because she knows I'll take them with alcohol. I wanted to be a doctor but my ambition is gone.Well I just wrote this as a warning. I've only been drinking for 3 years but I'm hooked. It started as getting drunk less than once a week, then every weekend, then almost every day. I would prefer being able to drink in moderation.Well I've gotta go try to ask for money from my friends to buy some liquor, I lost it all when I got drunk last night. I'm not the kind of person to get on my high horse and preach, but I think this needs to be said.  Looking through some of the reports on erowid, especially those dealing w/ psychodelics, authors INSIST that users have ground crews.  I've read several reports where people have basically said 'yeah, I read that a sitter should be used, but decided not to.  I was wrong.  Definitely use a sitter'.  What the hell are these people thinking?  If someone suggests a substance not be used w/o a sitter, don't use it without one!  I say this because you are potentially harming more people than just yourself.  I know many people might think this sounds like square bs, but think about it.  If you are truly trying to touch some grand benevolent force, you must first show good will toward those around you.  When you hurt or kill yourself on a substance, the substance is more likely to be made illegal, or be kept illegal.  This means responsible users are criminalized because of the stupidity of a few.  I had a friend who died when we were in high school.  He had been drinking heavily, and was left alone.  Suddenly, he was gone.  Where did he go?  He drove home without telling anyone.  He never made it.  No, I wasn't there to prevent him from leaving.  If I had been, I don't know if I would have realized the importance of keeping an eye on him.  If any of you can benefit from what I've written here, than my friend's life takes on greater meaning. I'd like to put this experience with heavy drinking on the site so that other regulars that visit erowid to research drugs can see how heavy drinking can really effect you.I am a heavyweight when it comes to drinking and im only 17. I smoke weed, and occasionaly I do lsd, shrooms, and opium. Every once and a while i pop a few painkillers. Anyway, me and my friends were going to a kids trailer for a night of partying. We had a bottle of vodka and jim beam. We were supposed to have weed but the dealer never came through.So i drank. Between the time of 7pm and 9pm i had about 3 drinks and i was somewhat buzzed. by this time the lightweights were already puking and passing out. I was still going. we stayed up and partied for a while longer. Around 3am everyone was asleep except for me. i noticed the jim beam was still pretty much full so i started doing shots. i lost count by the 8th shot. I dont remember anything, i was so drunk i couldnt tell if i was sleeping or still really drunk.I dont know if i slept, all i know is that i had been drinking from 3am to about 6 or 7am cuz when one of my friends woke up with a hangover i got up and was drunk out of my mind. I made a couple more drinks and passed out on the kitchen floor. I still dont remember much but i do remember getting into my friends trunk for a ride home (im claustrophobic) but it was the only way home. I was in the trunk for about 45 minutes. cuz my friends are assholes. When i got home i thought i was dying, i couldnt breathe. i puked in the toilet for a while and took a shower and slept. my hangover didnt start till 5pm that night. i felt horrible, that whole next day was completely irrelevent. Nothing mattered except get better and sober up. Turns out i had finished off almost the whole bottle of jim beam. If this gets on the site, please read this and reconsider heavy drinking, if ur gonna drink the hard stuff, moderate. 5 drinks is enuf to get u drunk. This was the worst experience of my life, dont let it happen to you. take care and be responsible.  DOSE: 55 mg smoked DMT (freebase) \\xa0 12 glasses oral Alcohol - Beer/Wine \\xa0            BODY WEIGHT:   200 lb         Last summer, after having a large quanity of extracted DMT on hand, I decided to smoke one evening. During this time, I was a severe alcoholic and I had drunk about 12 Heinekens, my usual for that time. I loaded my vaporizer and had a most unusual experience. It was exilarating and strangly reminded me more of 'psychedelic crack cocaine' than the usual experience. I wondered if perhaps cocaine addicts could wean themselves with this combination. It is not the transcendental feeling. In fact, it is a more wanton and sinister creature. I really grew fond of this combination and went this route for several days. Strangly, 5-MeO-DMT is NOT something that is pleasent while drinking - especially if you are drinking beer and wine. I lived in this wonderful house back in 1999 that had all sorts of herbs and things growing in our huge yard. The lady that lived there before said that there were fairies living in the garden and that they made the plants grow in the 'right way'. I never saw the fairies, but a friend and I were sitting in our courtyard one day looking at all the plants. The only one I could remember (that she had told us about) was the wormwood bush. We decided to take some bong hits, ok A LOT of bong hits, of some wormwood to see what it would do. Neither of us had any connections with a pot dealer or anything like that so we tried what we could find. After smoking about 6 bowls or so a piece -- man that stuff burned -- we both sat in our courtyard and talked about whatever. About maybe 5 minutes later our conversations got deeper and more intricate. We both had the same feelings of being EXTREMELY mellow. I kept zoning out on sounds and it seemed like the world was twisting together in some kind of symphonic dissonance that carried me with it. We then decided it was time to break out our next-door-neighbor's homemade wine (65 proof! and tasted intense but mellow). The rest of the day was kind of a haze but it was lots of fun.Another time we tried to make tea out of the wormwood -- I eventually used up a whole honey bear in a cup of that stuff and STILL couldn't drink it.    It had been a typical night, one which had started off as usual. Many of us huddled around the bong, waiting for the LSD to arrive.  Every person who entered who was not 'Junior' our dealer was a complete disappointment.  After endless bongloads and beer, he finally walked in the door. The evening had begun.  I am not a rookie to LSD, but this was definitely the most interesting experience I have ever had. After taking my first two tabs (paper) i sat down and we began to watch 'The Cell,' a movie we had been told was 'awesome when you are tripping.' After about a 1/2 hour, everyone was getting a little antsy and beginning to feel the effects coming on. We were in awe at the movie, but i was really wanting to hear Led Zeppelin the entire night.  I requested it to be played, but 'ssshhhh! we're watching the cell' was always the answer. After a few more fans arrived, we eventually started with the boxed set. Our hippie friend Christine had brought up her color changing flower (the kind you buy at spencers), and we turned off the lights and the tv and stared at it, and watched the colors change with the music. To this day, i wonder if the colors of the flower actually change with the music. I was extremely intrigued at the flower, and began to have mild hallucinations.   I thought the flower was a mailbox and was delivering this beautiful music and visualizations to us, and when i explained it to the rest of the friends, they seemed to agree. I was getting really freaked out because of the similarity of the music to the flower and decided to go outside and look at the sky. After i went out, i heard people saying 'what's wrong with greg? he wanted to hear zeppelin and now he's gone.' Outside i started to freak out. I looked at the sky, and saw a church in the distance which was not a hallucination. Hmm...the mailbox, the church? A similarity? It was too weird. Until i realized the night sky which the church inhabited. Near the church in the sky, was a pink cloud being colored by the sun, near what looked like the west--and there was a black cloud in what looked like the east.   This is where i had my revelation...i envisioned that the east was hell, being the direction of the coke dealer where my friends had gotten into lately, and the west was heaven where my girlfriend the angel was at. I could not stop looking at the clouds and thinking of metaphors to describe it. When i went inside to tell everyone what i was thinking about...it was at the part of the cd, where it says 'there's a feeling i get, when i look to the west, and my spirit is crying for leaving.' It was all too eerie for me to deal with and i began really getting freaked out. The west, with my girlfriend, where i want to be (like in the song), and the east where i don't want to be, with the coke....it was interesting.  This was all peaking in my trip for about two hours so i decided i should go to sleep and wake up in the morning and everything would be better. this is where the psychic moments happened. the apartment where i was earlier, across the complex had some people on the porch which i could see through my shut window. but not only could i see them, i could actually hear them. They were all, 'what is wrong with greg? is he ok? he was being weird and deep.' this all freaked me out even more so i began to wish that my friend melissa would be at my side, and i thought that if i thought of her enough she would appear in my doorway. as i thought and concentrated all my energy on her being there, i could feel her materialize in my pillow, her head, her mid-section, and her legs. It was almost as if she was there beside me, but at that moment, when she was almost fully complete in my bedsheets, the door opened and it was her. I started crying. It was unbelievable, and for the rest of the night we sat up talking about how weird LSD was, and how it takes you to a place that makes you understand consciousness.   This may seem really far-fetched and unbelieveable, but it is %100 true.thanks for believinggreg Well about 2 weeks ago a new batch of beans had gotten into town.  Really smacked out X-Files from Panama City, FL.  Took 2 1/2 Friday night and rolled my balls off.  Really good loving experience.  Saturday could only get my hands on two pills.  Dropped one at around midnight.  Chased with one cap full of GHB.  Started feeling effects alot sooner and stronger than the night before.  Maybe had something to do with the lack of food consumed that day, or maybe had something to do with the G.  One of my best friends and closest friends decided to take a walk.  We walked for about 2 miles and then sat down and just talked for like an hour.  The effects were so strong at this point all we could do was just lay and hold each other for like 30 mins.  At that point we walked back to the house and me, her and another friend of ours decided to go get them some more beans.  We got to the dudes house were I dropped my other pill (roughly around 3 am ) and I also chased this one with another cap of GHB.  Within 30 min I was in Heaven.  Someone persuaded me to have a mixed drink.  Good Ole' Crown and Coke. Just what I needed.  Alcohol mixed with GHB. (Should have listened to EROWID's warning).  Now what happened next shows that I do possess a great level of stupidity.  I gave a hit of the GHB to a friend of mine who claimed she wasn't rolling hard off of 3 of the X-Files.  GHB has always made me roll super hard.  She didn't like the taste (go figure) and started complaining.  So being the smart ass that I am I turned up the remaining G in the bottle to show it wasn't that nasty.  I later found out there were 3-4 cap fulls left in the bottle when I perceived there only being at the most 1 1/2.  Now that is WAY too much G at once.  Well my close friend and I went riding around with this other girl.  At about 5:30 am it all hit me at fucking once.  I started crying insanely telling my friend how much I loved her.  She held me real close and told me that she loved me that much too.  At that moment I blew up like never before.  It felt like I blew up for days.  It was the single best feeling ever I have felt on drugs.  Well my friend had to leave at 6 am and I began to feel like I was going to hoop out.  I layed down on the couch and wanted to pass out.  Then the trouble started.  Some guys came over who were rolling and smoking lots of weed.  When they found out that I had been taking GHB they started nagging me, talking alot of shit.  All I remember is one dude hitting me while I was laying on the couch.  When I got up to defend myself I got a kick right to the ribs.  The next thing I remember was my roommate sitting next to me on the couch.  He and my friends had came to pick me up and take me home.  There was nothing that I could have done to protect myself.  I was told that I started the shit with the guys and I apologized to them and explained to them the situation I was in that night.  The point of this long boring story is: Ecstasy mixed with GHB is INCREDIBLE, as long as you are careful about the amount you take and avoid alcohol. It started at about 7:00 at night... a friend and i went to a party at another friends house.  I brought some alcohol and a small film container filled with dried datura leaves that i had gathered and dried from an Indian reservation in Arizona earlier that summer.  I had a beer or two, and a shot or two of hard alcohol... Some time had passed approximately an hour or so, and I decided that it would be a good idea to get out the datura.  Or jimson weed as i refer to it, thorn apple, whatever you wanna call it.  I had read that it should be mixed with weed to not be as intense as the drug is known to be, but at present i was without access to weed.  At about 10 pm, i got out the datura, and we rounded up a pipe to smoke it from.  Between the three of us, we smoked three bowls of the substance.  About ten minutes later i began to feel its intense effects.  My body's temperature skyrocketed, and i felt very disoriented.  I decided to stay around the party for a short time after, approximately half an hour.  By that time i had decided that it was time to go home, i was feeling a little nauseous and just wanted to go to bed.  I got my sober friend to drive me back to my house after i said good bye to everyone at the party and stumbled to the car.  I could barely walk, my legs tightened and it felt like the ground was moving, but we finally got to the car.  He drove me to my house, approximately three minutes away, and he helped me up to my room as he and another friend were staying the night.  I had him throw on some music and I laid in my bed.  I pulled the covers on me then threw them off because i was still burning up.  I lay restless in my bed, and had my friend get me a glass of water to try and cool off.  I began to close my eyes and it felt as if my head were jolting back and forth, my legs kept moving and i was severly stirring in my bed.  I eventually drifted off to sleep around 2:00 am, and got up for work at 7:30 am.  I went to work at 8:00 for an 8:00 shift, i felt disoriented and extremely under-rested throughout the day.  I had a very nice experience though, though it could have been bad due to the unpredictability of the drug and my inexperience with the use of this type of drug.  I hope that everyone will have an equally beautiful experience and that they read up on the drug before dealing with it...  I was lucky. It was a Thursday night at college in Boston, a night not unlike many before. Actually, one thing was different. The night before I had obtained some hits of liquid acid in sugarcube form. I got out of work at 8:30pm and dropped all three immediately as I walked home to my building. I began to feel a mild sensation of dizziness which is usually my clue that I am about to feel the acid effects about 45 minutes later as I was showering. I dressed and got ready to go out to my friend's birthday party as the drug began to manifest itself.T + 1.5 hours: At the party I had been playing some beer games and talking to friends. A local drug dealer noticed that my pupils were dilated and asked me where I got the pills (meaning ecstasy). I told him I was tripping on acid (since I knew him and was not afraid he'd be weird about it). He offered me a pill if I'd get him some acid the next weekend, so I agreed. I took the pill immediately and chewed it completely up in my mouth to hasten the effects. T + 2.5 hours: The MDMA has been steadily climbing, colorful blobs began to pulse rhythymically in my field of vision, growing in intensity as the peak approached. I began peaking on the MDMA and acid very closely together. After drinking three or four more beers I decide I no longer want to drink anymore. T + 4 hours: At around 12:30 I leave the party with another drug dealer I know and return to her building to buy some really good buds she had. I got 1/8 and rolled up two joints for the walk back to the party. I walked through the Boston Common smoking joints and being completely awed by the grass and trees growing in the middle of the urban setting. My mind pictures a flower growing out of a crack in the sidewalk. At this point I began to watch my 'mind's eye' images (eidetic imagery, as explained in 'The Varieties of Psychedelic Experience' which is an extraordinary book, btw). I made it back to the party only to find my roommate has gotten into a big fight and had to be taken away to our friend's place in another neighborhood. I smoked another joint with the girl whose birthday it was, then headed out to find my roommate. Right before I was about to leave the drug dealer I got the E from pulled me aside and asked if I wanted to split a pill for free. I accepted and he crushed the pill and made two lines. I usually don't like to snort, but I decided to go for it anyways. After blowing the line of ecstasy I set off. T + 5 hours: I arrived at the apartment after taking WAY longer than normal to find it. I told my friends I feel 'a little funny' then sat down and smoked almost all the rest of the marijuana with them. They rolled up a big blunt with their own weed and we decided to go for a walk down to the bridge over the Charles River where we sparked the blunt and watch the river and traffic, plus the skyline of Cambridge. At this point I am tripping very hard... my friends melt and reform, carlights bend out in all directions, the sky changes colors and clouds fly by as if they were in stop motion videos...T + 8 hours: After coming home I closed my eyes and lay in bed. I found myself immersed in some kind of interior mental image of myself and my girlfriend making love. This image shifted away to a wide variety of different scenes populated by figures both familiar to me and some that were not. At some point my consciousness slipped away and I fell asleep.As a postscript to this report I'd like to say that I didn't feel I was as messed up as I ought to have been at the time. I had taken a lot of drugs and was expecting a more total immersion into some sort of fantasy world. I was functional and able to speak somewhat rationally throughout the duration of my trip. I found the following three nights that when I drank and smoked I felt the trip coming back to a certain extent, and saw some motion trails and strange visualizations. The fourth night this effect was very diminshed (perhaps due to my sobriety) and since I have not had any other side effects from the trip. I would highly recommend the candyflip, however leave the alcohol out of it. There is no reason to drink when you are on that many drugs, it doesn't even seem to make a difference at all. I'll try and be as accurate as possible because my memory is a little fuzzy from that night.It was a friday night and there was a party at the house of a girl from my school.  A lot of people I knew were gonna be there so me and a friend of mine made our way there. As soon as we got to the party I started drinking and about 15 minutes after i got there i smoked a pretty fat blunt, so i was feeling nice.I spent a lot of time just getting shit faced and talking to people then me and 2 other friends went and egged some dumb ass kids house by that time i was pretty trashed and when we got back i drank a couple big glasses of vodka. I dont really remmeber anything after that up until i left the party wiht the buddy i came with.I dont remmeber the walk except when we walked through the park and i puked on my sweatshirt and pants and fell flat on my ass.  I hurt my hand and my elbow too somehow. the next thing i rmember is being in my bathroom then (i dont remember any of this, this is what my mom told me had happened) my mom found me on the floor passed out breathing irregularly. she tried to wake me up for a long time then went and got my dad and they carried me into bed. i geuss i threw up that night to cause the next morning my barf bowl was pretty full, even though i have no memory of puking except in the bathroom and in the park.One thing i remember is my mom asking me if i was on mushrooms or any other drug and i laughed when she asked me. the day after i was sick all day even when i smoked a bunch of dank that night. What I want to report on is not the trip itself but my experience of coming down off the trip, which so far has changed my life. I had never done LSD or any other illegal psychoactive drug. The evening I did it, I was slightly drunk and naive and thinking illogically about taking LSD. I took three hits at once, then in the next twenty minutes 2 to 3 more. I had no expectations and no time to guess at them. My trip of intense hallucination and heightened auditory experiences lasted probably from midnight to eleven o'clock a.m.I can't say that there was any one thing good or bad about my trip, but what I made of the situation in the following days is what is important to me. I made the mistake of leaving the place I tripped in, before I fully came down from tripping. I felt and still feel I was ok to drive a few blocks home, but immediately the outside and city and other cars and things I passed on the street were disgusting to me. The only pleasant thing to look at was the sky. I felt angry, hateful, and nauseated by everything that was around me.I went home and tried to sleep but kept awaking sweaty, uncomfortable, with a shaking headache -- some things looked alright, others didn't. In my own house now, I realized I was still tripping but it was not as calming as the night before. My eyes, stomach and head hurt. If you remember the scene in Trainspotting where the main character is back at his parents in his bedroom and tossing and turning and then sees the baby climbing on the ceiling -- well I didn't see a baby or anything like that, but all that intense sporadic tossing and turning, that is how I was . . .I grew paranoid. I didn't want to see anyone's face, look out the window, or go in the bathroom. This all faded a bit as the day went on. Things were still 'off'. I decided staying in would be best. So I did - that night and every single day and night for the next seven days. The sun through my window was too bright. The smell of food was too strong. Voices too loud. Everything thing was 'too much', 'too ugly' 'too evil'. FINALLY a friend encouraged me to get out of the house.I am better now, but the paranoia carries with me. I don't like patterns or busy colors or being out in crowded places or on the city streets when they're busy. The most soothing things are grey, black, and bright white. I hope this doesn't go on. I used to love art, all kinds of music, people, places, sights, scenes..... Now I can only handle low stimuli. Of course LSD brought me a few good things -- a good moment, better knowledge of how MY mind works, and a strange sense of peace with myself. But I warn against it if you will accept my warning, because I had no idea the effect this drug could have (on me). Granted, I did 6 hits, but it is much too late to turn back and do less or none at all. p.s. i had been on the anti-depressants zoloft then prozac in the month or two before i did LSD. i tried going back on zoloft AFTER i did LSD, but i can't - the feeling it gives me is dead similiar to how i felt when i began to come down off LSD. doctors tell me and i've read these effects from zoloft are somewhat common . . . First a little background info. I'm a just a guy in high school that likes expanding his mind. Although I've tried LSD, Mushrooms, and 2C-T-7 before I hadn't really had a complete mind blowing trip before. I've taken 2C-T-7 on numerous occasions always oral. The last doses a little under the 50mg mark although it had always affected me it was the sort of thing that I almost thought was all just in my mind..placebo style.     I'm no addict and like to distance myself from some methods of taking drugs which includes injection and snorting. In this case though I had a much smaller quantity of 2C-T-7 and probably wouldn't get anymore for a *very* long time if ever. To make it go the extra mile I decided to try snorting it; something I had never done.     I had just got back from picking up my 2C-T-7 and some GHB which I had not tried before. I planned on crashing but as soon as I was home I got a call about a party going on in town. Looking forward to testing out the GHB I came over pronto. I had been given directions to start with a teaspoon of GHB then move up to another 1/2 in the next glass of juice.     Thats exactly what I started with...a teaspoon and some Capri Sun. I sipped it slowly and waited...nothing I tried another teaspoon in some cranberry juice. Waited...nothing. I took a break. During this break the party completely dissolved all the women left and most of the guys. Only four of us remained. I went back to the GHB and my three friends started on it. Eventually I was taking shots with someone (of GHB). I was still being careful I wasnt too fucked up with breaks inbetween etc. Finally I was sufficently messed up.      GHB is an interesting drug: in my mind I was very fucked up and it felt like my eyes were just moving around in random directions whereas in reality I was walking alright and my eyes were fine. I really like it in that respect (this was verified with video footage :)  ).      We got to talking and figured out nobody else was going to be coming out to the house. Might as well just fuck ourselves up badly it had been awhile since that had happened. One of my friends complained about things spinning really fast (something I hadnt noticed tho I had drank a lot of GHB too) and went to his room and crashed it was maybe 1 or 2 AM when that happened. Another of my friends crashed on the couch suddenly. So there was just my friend 'Billy' (not real name) and I sitting at the table. We put some GHB in some beer. I had heard not to mix but at this point I  had stayed up late enough and figured even if I passed out it would be cool because I wasnt feeling sick at all and wouldnt be throwing up. I had a little I was drinking it hella slow because I wanted to play it on the safe side. I think there might have been a shot o everclear somewhere in there too I know my friend was drinking a lot of GHB and hard a.      I remembered about my 2C-T-7 capsule I had brought and busted it out. It was 22mg we made two lines, mine was a little bigger but not by much. I was reluctant to snort it because I had heard it felt like a bitch and never snorted anything before. It actually wasnt all that bad. I mean it hurt like a bitch but not nearly as bad as I was expecting...besides I forgot about it pretty quick.           One thing you have to understand about 2C-T-7 is when you take a capsule orally it can take AT LEAST 2 1/2 hours to start to work. I snorted it and within 10 minutes I was tripping hardcore. I went into the bathroom right after snorting it because my nose hurt and I was just wondering how fucked up I looked. The tiles of the floor started going wavy...melty like the mirror likewise. Anyone who has done acid or 2C-T-7 knows what I mean. Pretty soon everything was doing this. I mean everything all over just distorting. I was amazed it looked so realistic from any angle. Soon random sparkles were showing up, as well as some patterns, lights were much brighter and left sparkles/split, tracers on my friend when he walked around. Soon I noticed an interesting body load and dropped to my knees. 2C-T-7 has always done this to me it feels as if my entire body is flexed or ready to act all the time and relaxed at the same time. Hard to explain, its not a negative or postive effect in my book. As I sat there I noticed I was drooling. My friend and I still hadnt talked at all since dosing...we were gone.           I looked over and 'Billy' was in the bathroom puking his guts up. When I say guts thats seriously what it looked like to me. If this was from the hard a, beer, ghb, 2C-T-7 or a little of both I dont know. I went over there but it smelled like shit. I have no idea how much time had passed by then but I was seriously fucked up. I was cold all over from the outside-in something that always happens with 2C-T-7 and me again. I went into a room that we had set up and laid down under the covers. Everyonce in awhile I started to shake. Still it was amazing I was out of my mind. My mind and its thoughts were liquid they just flowed. It actually felt like liquid. My friend came in to lay down also.      We got up after a few minutes and went back into the living room where we dosed. Billy started randomly cleaning now. It was the heighth of his trip he later informed me. He cleaned the entire living room as I just sat there talking to him now and then. Sounds during the heights of the experience were oddly uncomfortable. Seriously Im not so sure I would want to listen to music which is something I always am doing. I went in and out of the bathroom. What a rank sight and smell! Eventually the smell (I think) made me throw up. Once it was out I felt *a lot* better. I just sat on the tiles of the bathroom staring at my vomit as it changed forms it looked like some sort of alien/starfruit like object. I flushed it and looked up there was some sort of saint or crusafix-ish picture above the toilet the colors waved in and out of the picture. The figure told me to get up and wake up one of my friends who was in his room. I ran in there with Billy and we got him up for awhile but he was pretty much out for good. The floors were at this point amazing..they were literally waves crashing against my feet. I looked at his wall and checked out the posters. Dali posters were as always great, but surprisingly the best was a Beatles poster. The band members faces were colorful negatives (thats the best way to describe it) and on 2ct7 they took on a life of their own, amazing.     The rest of the night was Billy and I getting into bed saying we are going to sleep completely tripping out or getting into wierd ass conversations then getting back up walking around getting back in bed etc. At around 5 AM the visuals had died down as far as distortions etc. and we entered this conversation stage. We would just start laughing and couldnt stop for anything we laughed non stop for the longest time it hurt. Then we would stop and start laughing again a few minutes later.     That night was a long fucked up series of events. I had been drooling, shaking, and puking during the trip. It was very hardcore. My friend who has done way more drugs than I have or ever will probably said it was the strongest thing he had ever taken. He told me while he was laying down that green slugs were crawling on him and slapping his face...I dont doubt it.     I consider myself lucky I didnt snort the entire capsule as I had planned. This is just another reminder to be careful with substances. Even I who had had a fair amount of experience with lucky seven simply changed the dosing method and had a much more powerful mind blowing experience.  DOSE: T+ 0:00 1.1 oz oral Nutmeg (powder / crystals) \\xa0 T+ 0:32 480 mg oral DXM (pill / tablet) \\xa0 T+ 0:45 140 seeds oral Datura (seeds) \\xa0 T+ 0:50 0.5 tablets insufflated Hydrocodone (pill / tablet) \\xa0 T+ 0:55 0.5 tablets insufflated Amphetamines (pill / tablet) \\xa0 T+ 1:40 \\xa0 bowls smoked Cannabis (plant material) \\xa0 T+ 2:10 6 oz oral Alcohol (liquid)            BODY WEIGHT:   128 lb         INTRODUCTION:  On the night of 10-27-00, I was desparate to get high because I had been sober for 2 months.  My friend L was blabbing about combining drugs and he ended up betting me 1/4 oz. of marijuana that I woudn't do all of these drugs at once.  I agreed on the bet, and we gatherd up the drugs (I paid for the bud,dxm,alcohol,nutmeg, he got the datura, vicodin, and ritalin).  In case you're wondering, before this experience I had smoked weed, tripped off of dxm (only once, using 8 pills), tripped off of Datura (called moonflower where I live, I've taken it twice, both times eating all the seeds in one pod), and gotten drunk.  I had never tried vicodin, ritalin, or nutmeg before this.  There were 3 people involved, including me.  I will call my two friends 'L' and 'M.'  To prepare for the experience, we got all of the drugs I was going to take.  It was a Friday, so I was able to stay away from parents, cops, teachers, etc. for a few days (I went to L's house, along with M, L's father was home at first, but the only people at L's house from 12:45pm Fri. to 4:00 pm Sat. were me, M, and L).  We also got ice cubes, jolly ranchers, and orange juice.  We had everything ready and planned out by about 1:00 p.m.All names and phone numbers have been changed.The first thing I did was eat the (ugh) nutmeg (I had a full 1.1 oz. bottle of it).  I ate mouthfuls of nutmeg at a time, swallowed as fast as I could, then drank the orange juice.  I ended up eating that whole bottle of nutmeg (very hard to do without puking, I got very close to puking, but stopped myself).  I waited until 1:32 p.m., then I swallowed the DXM pills (Coricidin Cough+Cold, 16 pills, 480 mg. DXM).  At 1:45, I ate the moonflower seeds (2 pods with about 2 1/4 in. diameter, about 140 seeds, uncooked, not dried).  Then I snorted a little less than 1/2 of the vicodin pill and 1/2 of the ritalin pill.  I started feeling dizzy and light headed by 1:53.At 2:40, I was still feeling the ritalin (I think it was the ritalin, I was hyper and dizzy, I also think that the moonflower trip had started too) and definately feeling the DXM.  I wanted a high of the weed, so I smoked about a dime (I had a quarter for me to smoke, L and M had 1/8 oz for them to share).  L and M smoked a couple bowls between them.  We just sat around and talked until about 3:10, when M was telling me I had better drink the alcohol and smoke the rest of the weed, because I would be trippin' too hard.  I smoked the rest of the weed, but it really hurt my throat (I had bad dry mouth from the moonflower).  I was sucking on ice cubes while I was smoking, and that helped a little, the jolly ranchers didn't work as good.  The last thing to do was drink the alcohol, so I drank a screwdriver that L made (with about 4 shots of vodka) and drank about a cup of Captain Morgan's Parrot Bay Coconut Rum (L's dad bought it and the vodka, then he left for work, he didn't know about the other drugs though).  I felt really f^ck@d up.  The only things I remember after this was watching parts of the first 5 or 10 minutes of Scream 3 (M rented it) and talking some.  The rest of the story is what L and M told me, I don't remember any of it except parts of my dream(s).When we were watching the rest of the movie, I kept leaving the room.  M followed me, and I guess I just wandered around his house.  He would tell me to come back to the room, and I would respond by just blabbing on like 'Oh, he doesn't have the pipe, but I bet the gem will.' or 'seriously?  I thought you weren't.'  M would just then lead me back into his room.  I said something like 'arso the dog has burned my throat' and pointed to my mouth, then I tried to run to the bathroom, but I kept falling and stumbling, so I crawled to his trash can and puked in it twice in a row.  My eyes were very bloodshot, my pupils were dialated, and my eyes were wide open.  I peed my pants at about 4:00, and at 4:45 I could hardly breathe.  I tried to talk, but when no sound came out, I just pointed to my mouth and started crying.  I was drinking a lot of orange juice, and eating ice cubes and jolly ranchers to try to get rid of the dry mouth.  At about 6:25 pm., I passed out on the floor of M's room.  In my sleep I was twitching a lot, and I was saying everything out loud.  (my friends stayed awake to make sure I didn't break anything, and sometimes I woke up and rearranged things for no reason (like putting a stack of paper in the freezer, and moving the tv around the room).  From 6:30 pm. to 3:20 am. I was talking, but I slept until 6:15.  These are some of the things my friends remember me saying:'Seriously?' (I said that at least 8 times)'Hi, is B there?'  'Isn't this 555-0934?' (B is one of my friends)'Hi, is R there?'  'It's already 8:00, what's taking you so long?'  (R is my weed dealer, It was about 11 pm when I said that)'Y, GET IN HERE!' (Y is my brother, I yelled it LOUD)'Man, where'd the bowl go!?!? it was right here!' (I said this a lot, sometimes saying joint instead of bowl, and I would open my eyes most the times I said it)'You can't do that already!!'I remember everything after I woke up.When I woke up, I was still tripping off the moonflower, but everything else had worn off.  I was hearing things and felt kinda drunk.  As for visual hallucinations, I only remember 2 (some moving green blob on my door, and color differences).  M told me 'why were you talking so much man, last night was so trippy to see you like that.'  I had no idea what he was talking about, then M and L told me about how I was talking for such a long time.  The only things I remember dreaming about were calling B on the phone and walking around my school.  I stayed at M's house, but L went home at 8:00 am.  I went home at 3:00 pm.  because M said I was talking to people that weren't there, but I stopped around 2:15 pm.  I was sick for about 3 days after that and L gave me that well-deserved 1/4 oz.  So, in conclusion, I would recommend never combining too many drugs.  What I did was very stupid and almost caused me to die. I have multiple experiences with drugs and can only recommend that everyone be very careful with this newer drug.  I am a very capable drinker and have used almost all drugs and had very few ill effects until, I got the geebers.  I had approximately 15 cocktails of a mixed variety (beer, liqour and wine).  I then ran into some friends in a club who passed me some G.  I had used this drug approximately 20 times over 3 years before and had only positive results.  Apparently, I drank over half a bottle, and began the vomiting, convulsing effect others have described.  If not for some friends who called my roommates, I would have ended up in the local jail or detox earlier.  However, after about an hour of vomiting I was placed in the bed of my roommate's truck to go home.  The next part of this story is one of the most unbelievable acts I have ever heard of, let alone been part of.  While on the way to my house, I awoke and stood in the bed of the truck.  I assumed a surfing demeaner until I thought it would be all right to 'fly' from the truck.  I was retrieved from the highway by my roommate and taken home in an immense amount of pain.  After about six hours I was taken to a local hospital and treated for a snapped humerous.  I am lucky to have lived through this expressway diving incident and have yet to find any others that have hallucinated to the point I did that night.  As I forward this tale I am currently still using this drug.  After $3000 in medical expenses, I still enjoy this buzz and can only offer this advice, 'Moderation.'  DOSE: 1 shot oral Unknown             BODY WEIGHT:   108 lb         The other evening I went over to a friend's house (a friend that I have known for nine years) who lives with her boyfriend, to have dinner, a few drinks and a movie.  The pasta and meatballs were delicious complimented by a very small dirty martini over ice.  After dinner they mixed me another cocktail and I was feeling a little buzzed.  NOT DRUNK!!!!Her boyfriend brought over three shots of what he called his funky beer shot.  I really didn't feel like doing a shot, but if it was only beer, I thought, what the hell.  So I did the shot.  It tasted like a shot of lime juice.  They asked me to take a dip in the hot tub with them at the community pool.  I didn't really feeling like going, but they finally talked me into it.  There were a bunch of people already at the pool, but no one that I knew.  I sat for a while just chatting with people.  I was now on my third drink (this was in a span of about 4 hours).  I began to feel really funny.  The entire place was spinning and I felt extremely sick.  I tried to hang in there and pretend that this was nothing, but it just got more intense.  I was going to puke for sure.  I staggered to the pool bathroom, and with no hesitation began projectile vomiting all over.  Well, the bathroom was spinning and I felt like I had absolutely no control.  I was really dizzy, but I thought I would try to go back to where everyone was.  I staggered a few feet and went right back in the bathroom and puked like I never puked in my entire life.The pasta and meatballs were everywhere.  I stumbled back to their apartment and scrambled looking for a phone to get some help.  I knew that this feeling was not normal....I finally was able to reach some help.  The happy drunk couple made it back to the apartment and kept walking to the bathroom where my head was over the toilet and my friend(?) would come back in the bathroom and steal the phone away from me so I couldn't make any phone calls. (Very Strange!!!)I was sad to find out that there is no way to prove that they put this awful drug in my drink.  They will probably deny it forever, but I know the truth.I am 30 years old and I know what three drinks feel like and what happens to me when I drink too much.  This was not even close to that feeling.I don't know how anyone can take this as a recreational drug.  It was one of the most horrible experiences of my life.  Final thought... You don't really know what people are capable of and you just better watch your back in any partying, drinking situation.  When your best friend screws you over, who the heck knows what a stranger could do?! Phish rules to begin with.  Tripping to their music is an out of body experience.The pharmies were just for fun, god knows what they actually did.  The acid and k put me in to the warp zone.  I had such abstract thoughts that made complete sense at the time.  And the dancing, could not stop for my life.  Michael Rey a jazz trumpeter got on stage and went nuts dancing like Jim Morrison with his indian dream figures.  Then he started playing.  It was fucking out of control.  Best Sex ever.  Heaven is a place on earth.  Z-Crak_Makdont do crak or smakPS.  Later that nite when we blasted the rest of the k and danced around crackie's crib...   i drank shitloads of beer til 10:30 when i fell down the basement steps...  20 stiches in my knee... didnt really hurt at the time but i am minorly disabled for a while (on crutches)PPS.   Drugs are fun... be careful not to have too much fun to often and you fall down the stairs and gash your knee open I was only 14 at the time of getting shitfaced.  Me and my dad usually go to my uncles trailer by the lake on weekends. He usually brings a cube of beer (24) there to unwind. One time he left early and left all the beer in the fridge.  I have gotten drunk a couple of times before and decided to go again.  I had 2 beers to start out in a huge plastic cup, its the best way to drink. I decide to take a quadbar 2 mg xanax to help me get drunk. Not a good idea.  I ended up getting a little daring and drank 4 more beers.  I don't remember much except for waking up, leaning over the bed and throwing up. I was to exhausted to clean it up so I put a thrashcan over the mess.  At around 10:00 my uncle woke me up to ask why I was passed out in the middle of the hall last night pissing on the floor.  I dont even remember that.  I hope this will tell you not to mix drugs!!!  DOSE: \\xa0  oral Alcohol (liquid) \\xa0 \\xa0  oral Caffeine (liquid) \\xa0 \\xa0  smoked Cannabis (plant material)            BODY WEIGHT:   135 lb         I noticed there aren't many alcohol experiences posted here, so I figured I'd share one of mine.  Me and my friend, both 18 at the time, acquired a half-gallon of vodka, and a quarter oz of marijuana.  We decided to mix the vodka with mountain dew.  Some pots of coffee were also mixed with vodka at one time.We had both been drunk and high enough times before, on a number of occasions.  So we took a few shots of vodka, smoked a bong, and proceeded to mix 50%/50% vodka/mountain dew in the largest plastic cups we could find.  We spent a LONG time drinking, probably drank about half of the bottle, and god knows how much mountain dew, smoking more pot from time to time, then we decided to take a walk.Well, we ended up going into an long abandoned black church through a broken window.  We ended up stealing the stupidest things, a picture of jesus, collection plates, a water-logged bible, all worthless anyway. On the way back we also took a 100 pound concrete virgin mary statue from a neighbor's house.  We then proceeded to walk through the woods to another part of town, and break windows in cars at the local bar.  We then ran, once somebody ran out of the bar yelling 'HEY what the hell are you doing?'We then went to an ex-friend of ours' house and slashed all 4 of the tires on his car.  We then went back to my friend's house, nearly finished the bottle, and passed out.  2 people, almost a half gallon of vodka (~80 proof)We never did get in trouble for any of the things we did, but we both felt really bad about stealing the junk from the church, even if it was an abandoned church and all of the items were previously ruined.  We snuck back in the following night and returned the items anyway.  I hope that whoever is reading this gets the lesson I learned the hard way.  Liquor can do BAD things to you, and caffeine just makes it worse.  It seemed to me that the caffeine kept us from vomiting (which might have stopped our binge, or at least slowed it down), and also kept us from passing out earlier.  In retrospect, we're lucky we didn't die of alcohol poisoning, or get arrested.  I haven't touched vodka since, and don't plan to again.  I'll stick with beer from now on! A usual party.  About 5 or 6 friends getting together over sex and alcohol. I drank three huge gulps of this rum...so what, I have smoked tons of weed before, droped acid, I can handle a bit of this...it was my first time drinking believe it or not.'Wow!' I said, 'Josh, I don't think this is alcohol doing this!' 'Dude, you've never been drunk?'  He said looking at me.  I was lying, literately, in the middle of the vacant street. 'No Josh, it was laced with something.'  I said trying, as hard as I could to stand up and walk straight.'What a dumb-ass.'  He said and laughed.  I was.  The first time I got drunk was more intense then acid or grass.  Things were scrolling past my eyes so fast.  But best of all...the best thing about alcohol is that you are (at least for me) giddy, happy and always on a good trip...rather than marijuana where you are just absent minded and LSD where you are off in la-la land, alcohol is...well, fun!  So keep having fun everybody.  Peace and love.  DragonfliP.S.  I lost my virginity that night when I was drunk...if any of you are shy like myself at parties, drink a little bit...your more communative. Well me and my friend were walking home from school and he was telling me about his dad's significant amount of alcohol. He said that when we got there he would challenge me to how many shots we could take. We got there and he said i could choose whatever kind i wanted. I chose a bottle of 80 proof bicardi. He took out some shot glasses and poured the first 2 shots. We tilted our heads back and chugged. That shit was strong! It burned a little and was bitter tasting. We decided it was time for round 2. I poured the shots this time. As before, we tilted our heads back and chugged. It was still a little bitter but the burn wasn't as bad. As for the next 2 shots, all that happened was the same, only the bitterness and burn weren't as bad. At this time we felt all dizzy and shit. He poured another round. I leaned back and gulped mine.He had a bit of trouble with his, but he took i like a man. The next 2 shots were pretty intense. We both took them, But we just couldn't handle anymore. We filled the bottle with water to make it look like none was missing. I remember seeing everything as a blur, And when i stood up to go sit on the couch,my legs were heavy as hell and i fell down. I crawled to the couch. I had this terrible headache. I sat on the couch and leaned back for a while.I stared at the ceiling and couldn't tell where the fan was. I suddenly felt this surge in my throught. I ran to the bathroom and threw up all in the toilet (i think). Then i crawled over to the couch and just lay there. I was tired as shit so i just fell to sleep. When i woke up, my friends dad wasn't home yet so i woke him up and we cleaned up everything. We still felt dizzy so we decided to go to my house (across the street) to smoke some weed. Thats what i remember.\""
