# Psynalisis - psychedelic data science
 Analysis of drug experiences downloaded from [erowid.org](erowid.org) (with the help of the script of [basnijholt](https://github.com/basnijholt/psychedelic-data-science)).

The following analyses were done: 

- Data exploration, visualization - word clouds, vocabulary complexity comparison.
- Sentiment analysis - categorizing experiences into *positive, negative and neutral* groups.
- Classification - grouping drug experiences based on the most frequent words in them, a.k.a. [topic modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Topic_model).
