This was my third experience with the blood red mushrooms ordered from a company in Wisconsin.  My first two doses were very small, about 3.5g and they were brewed in a tea (recipe found on-line).  The low dose experiences seemed harmless enough, so I decided to delve deeper into the Soma dimension by eating 5.5g of caps/stems mix (basicly the bottom of the bag)  I didn't expect to be blown out of the sky; man was I in for a suprise!<br/>
<br/>
T+0hours:  I ingest 5.5g of red Amanita Muscaria caps/stems at 3:30pm while eating an apple to cover up the taste (which actually, wasn't as bad as I expected, kind of like sunflower seeds!).<br/>
<br/>
T+2hours:  Hmm...getting a little worried because nothing evident is happening.  If I would have had more, I would have eaten a few more grams here, good thing I didn't!  Little did I know that these little monsters take some time to kick in! no nausea at all at this point.  I go to my friends place and we take a walk outside, which was very peaceful.  I feel happy and clear at this point.<br/>
<br/>
T+2.5 hours:  Feeling a little buzz and in fear of nausea, I smoke a little cannibis with my friend.  This seems to help the mushrooms' effects come to life, as I not only feel the marajuhana high, but an extra wave of physical sensation and mental stimulation, somewhat like LSD is noticed.  This was a great feeling, much like the peak of my first two experiences with the tea (which seemed to start faster??). <br/>
<br/>
T+3.5 hours:  My vision is starting to get real fuzzy, even though I have my glasses on, and I have a strong urge to hear some weird music, so I go back home and put on some of Dr. Timothy Leary's musical adventures, thinking that this might bring out the psychodelic experience of these mushrooms.  I think this was a bad idea, because Leary's music seems to make everything scary and realistic.  I start to get 'bad trip thoughts' like I have experienced with large amounts of LSD or DXM. I felt like I was going to die or that I was going to be sick, but I never puked.  I felt extremely dizzy, as if I were very drunk and high at the same time.  I then got an intense wave of lethergy, and I decided the only thing to do was to lie down on my bed.  I closed my eyes, and it seemed that everything good old Dr. Leary would say would appear on the backs of my eyelids!  This was somewhat fun/interesting, some what scary, simply because of the nature of his music.  I think I fell asleep, because the next thing I knew, my friends were knocking on my door, wanting to go out to dinner!<br/>
<br/>
T+5 hours:  I stumble to the resturant with my buddies, and run into about everything I could posibly run into, but don't feel any pain whatsoever.  My friends are just chuckling and we're all having a good time with my inability to act sober.  I don't feel at all hungry, but I know from past experience with Psylocybin mushrooms that eating actually helps, as long as it's not too much or too greasy.  I order something off the menu, without even thinking about it, and almost fall asleep in my folded arms on the table.  The food comes, and it turns out I ordered something that I don't even like, some cajun grilled chicken burger with greasy french fries.  (at my present state, this looked and smelled horrible!)  I swallowed most of it down, with a lot of white soda (at least I ordered something right) and I started to feel a releaving sense of energy come back into my limbs.  <br/>
<br/>
T+6 hours:  We walked back home, and my vision was extremely distorted, as if I wasn't wearing my glasses, but no color visuals or anything psychodelic like that.  I feel a lot better after eating, and retire to my room to chill and enjoy the finally positive feeling that I have been waiting for.<br/>
<br/>
T+7 hours:  Pretty much sober by now, able to talk to the 'normals' without any trouble and I can see straight again.  Took some diphenhydramine to help me sleep.  <br/>
<br/>
I woke up rather tired, but this could have been because of the diphenhydramine alone.  all in all, I think the trip was educational, because during the peak, while listing to Timothy Leary, I figured out some interesting stuff that was in my subconscious, but the experience was really nothing like I expected.  I would not call this drug a psychedelic, it's really in a leauge of it's own.  At a low dose, it makes you feel good, like opium, yet your mind is clear as day. I definetly want to continue expereincing that level.  But once you eat more of them, it's no longer pleasurable, more of a downer/sedative, with mental stimulation like powerful Acid, yet no visuals that are fun to watch, and you don't get that great happy/peace loving feeling that you do on psychedelc mushrooms.  The weirdest thing about this drug though is that it doesn't take effect for a long time!  I could easily see some people eating a good amount, not feeling anything in 2 hours, and doubling their dose.  This is NOT SMART!  I can tell by the relatively wimpy dose that I took that anything more then 6g is pushing it if you want to have a good time.  This is strong stuff!<br/>
<br/>
Be careful with Anamita muscaria, it deserves some respect.  It definately works, no question about it, but like DXM, I don't really think it's for everyone.<!-- End Body -->
