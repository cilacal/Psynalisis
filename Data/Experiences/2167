<!-- Start Body -->

25mg 2CB, orally, about 3 hrs prior. Feeling high and good, tho' not especially 'tripping'. Put on Spacetime Continuum's 'Sea Biscuit', and loaded a medium-sized hit of dried Salvia.<BR>
<BR>
First hit: I'm amazed at the way this stuff hits me: there's no transition. I just fill a bowl and try to put myself in a receptive state of mind, but at the same time wonder if it'll really work. Even as I smoke it,I'm trying to remember how I should think, as if I needed to try to be in the right frame of mind. Exhale, thinking 'how do I get there from here?....', then WHAMMO, I'm somewhere, someone, something else.<BR>
<BR>
Infinitely long street, fenceposts and mailboxes stretch out forever. Green,sunny,suburban. Alien different physics and dimensionality. There is a strong force- a gravitational pull that is the center of my local universe. I realize that this point, strong as a black hole, is actually the connection to my jaw (of my 'real' body, sitting back home on the couch). My mouth is gaping open, and this other universe pivots around the sensation- like being stuck in a huge cosmic yawn. The thought crosses my mind that I could come out of this with a dislocated jaw, but it hurts so good!<BR>
<BR>
Feeling of a lucid dream. I know my eyes are lightly closed, and feel like I could see my surroundings more clearly if I could open them, but I can't. At the same time, I can see/feel 360 degrees. The by now familiar salvia sensation of a passing parade or procession; I'm both in it and observing it.<BR>
<BR>
2nd hit : A few minutes later. The track 'Subway' is starting, and I wanted to use this to travel, but it backfired. Lie down on the floor on my back, flat but with legs crossed at the ankles. Again, go from wondering how to get somewhere, to being in a completely different reality. Sink straight down, to a stained-glass, mosaic world. Instead of a subway, it seems more like a busstop, cause it's outside. I'm a businessman with a briefcase, impatiently checking my watch, then my briefcase changes to a big flat portfolio, and I'm a model (female)- need to see my agent, but the damn bus/train is never coming! Realize I kind of set myself up with the music- the song never really gets going. Feel stuck- if the music would just take off, I'd be travelling to who-knows-what exciting places.<BR>
<BR>
Start feeling a painful gravity, and realize it's my knees: my legs are pressed tightly together. Eventually relax my legs a little, and slowly come out of it.<BR>
<BR>
3rd hit : 5 min. later. Slump half on/half off the futon. Very strange dimension - I'm squeezed flat, feel like tape in a tape dispenser. I become an n-dimensional mobius creature, a ribbon that mates with itself. In 'real' life, I'm trying to stop from sliding completley off onto the floor, and this tension creates some of the forces of this world.<BR>
<BR>
Writing this now, the next morning, I'm struck by how it's the connection to my body in real life, tenuous and garbled, that creates a big part of these other worlds. The physical hallucinations make these realities much more convincing. Wonder what it would be like to go deeper. Don't know if the connection to this physical plane is key to the whole thing, or just one stage or level. Could easily say 2CB is a big contributor to the physical effects, since it has a strong physical energy of its own. It does seem to be an excellent potentiator. However, the first time I broke through with salvia, I was otherwise straight, and there were strong physical gravity effects then too.<!-- End Body -->
