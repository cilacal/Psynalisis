My roommate had recently gotten a 'gift' from a friend of his in Denver. He and I have experimented with several substances in the past and most certainly enjoy tripping together. One night shortly after the semester at school had started, we decided to share the 2c-i he had received. <br>
<br>
T + 0:00     I chose to snort 25mg through a Guatemalan Quetzal bill, he chose to mix his in a shot of vodka.<br>
<br>
T + 0:15     Nothing yet, significant burning sensation in my sinuses and a good deal of drip down the back of my throat, very bitter tasting.<br>
<br>
T + 0:30     Some open eye visuals begin. I started getting the chills pretty bad. I then decided to crank up the thermostat to 78 degrees(which I later regretted in the morning), I also covered myself with a blanket.<br>
<br>
T + 0:45     Even though I still had the chills, I could feel I was burning up. My heart was pounding and I began to get very hyper. We had been watching 'Family Guy' as we were waiting for the 2c-i to kick in, and even though it was an episode I'd seen several times, I found it absolutely hilarious and couldn't stop laughing. At one point I looked at the blinds in our living room and they appeared as if they were dancing. My roommate had only just started to come up.<br>
<br>
T + 1:00     At this point I decided to retreat to my room and listen to music as I heard that music was very pleasurable while on 2c-i. I put on a techno compilation and proceeded to turn the volume up very high so it was almost pulsing through the apartment. I lay on my bed with the lights off and the music blaring, a lot of the tracks I didn't even like seemed to have a new side to them. Music almost seemed to have another dimension, like I not only heard it, but I felt it.<br>
<br>
T + 1:45     At this point I switched the music to my all time favorite album, Nine Inch Nails-The Downward Spiral. Already a very sad and emotional album, the feeling of it was amplified almost 10 fold while on 2c-i. <br>
<br>
T + 2:45     After listen to that album, I began to draw. After my pen left the ink on the page, the ink seemed to come alive and crawl around the page. A lot of what I drew tended to be what I thought would look interesting if it crawled!<br>
<br>
T + 3:00     After drawing got boring, writing seemed like a good idea. A lot of what I wrote would not make any sense to a sober person, but at the time, it made complete and total sense. Even now I understand what I meant.<br>
<br>
T + 4:00     A lot of the mental effects are beginning to wear off. Still having a lot of open eye visuals such as the blinds dancing and the wood grain swirling. A great sensation of awakeness came over me at this point. I felt more awake and alert than I ever had in my entire life.<br>
<br>
T + 4:30     I hadn't eaten a lot before the trip so I could be sure to avoid the nauseous side effects, so at this point I was very hungry. I decided to have a grilled cheese sandwich, it almost seemed tasteless. Chewing was very difficult, my jaw almost felt like it was glued shut. After I finally swallowed the first bite, it felt very uncomfortable, almost like I was going to choke. At that point I decided eating was a bad idea.<br>
<br>
T + 5:00     Just going on 4am and the visuals are finally starting to wear off. I feel very awake and unable to fall asleep.<br>
<br>
In all, it was an enjoyable trip. The feelings felt were very extreme, both emotionally and physically. I next plan on taking it and going to a techno club to see what fun I can have there.<!-- End Body -->
