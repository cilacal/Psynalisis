I have never liked sharing my experiences with others as they are a personal matter for me.  However I decided to finally post one as I decided to share Ayahuasca with someone else.  This dose is accurate and was potent, I don't recommend it for those not ready for it.<br/>
<br/>
Fasted 24 hours prior to ingestion, I'm sure it could be a shorter time span, but fasting always helps clear my head prior to Ayahuasca [-type Brews].<br/>
<br/>
Syrian Rue was boiled and drank every 15 minutes for roughly two hours.  Pronounced sedation, uncoordinated balance and hypnagogic like hallucinations in the far field of vision were felt before consuming the elixir.  A cloth was taken and dipped in the Syrian Rue and body was adorned with symbols and hands covered.  It's nice to glow under the black lights.<br/>
<br/>
60 grams of Mimosa was pulvarized using a blender then placed in water and vinigar solution.  Mimosa was boilded over 5 times then reduced to four 'shots'.  The final outcome was pure BLACK and thick.  This was halved.<br/>
<br/>
Everything done except the initial dose was eyeballed.<br/>
<br/>
Regarding making it, I see a lot of discussion about the preparation.  I never use scales or measuring cups or time things.  I really doubt the Mayan's did either.  Ayahuasca knows when you've had to much and you will purge when it's time.  My aquantince purged a full 15 minutes before I did so I can only imagine how things would have been had the elixer not made him purge when it did.  The only thing important behind preparing it is intent.  Boiling water and throwing some viniger in it is not so hard.  I reduce it until it turns black then I know it's right.<br/>
<br/>
I had spent half the day with m,y aquantince, attempting to drive into him that Ayahuasca is not a recreation drug and I am happy to share the experience with him.  I brought along several books, video's and tryied to show him some web pages regarding the expewreinece and trying to get him to create a good mind set.  He would have very little of it, opting to bullshit with others present and look at other web sites.<br/>
<br/>
The elixer was consumed in two quick shots. Effects were felt within 5 minutes.  Mystical Sun and Biosphere were played for the come on.  Things progressed very rapidly, a strong body buzz was felt, enough that I was knocked to the floor and could only manage to flop around abit in pure euphoria.  Unlike other tradition psychadelics and empathogens, the feeling for me on Ayahuasca is like real grace and connection with a higher awareness.  <br/>
<br/>
At this point my fellow traveller was feeling this to.  He tried to fight it at first, stating that 'they' were in the corner (ironically, in the upper left corner of his vision, death is up and to the left so I've heard) and they were trying to take him.  I told him that he must not fight them and they will show him things.  I to see the entities and unless you've done it there is no describing it.  He settled down and he was in that state of grace as well.  He could only repeat 'ohhhhhh, they're showing me everything'.  <br/>
<br/>
I purged after 20 minutes and things began to pick up pace.  My body was freed and I was overwhelmed by a tremendous energy and sense of freedom.  I got up and moved around, every beat of the music driving in the truth deeper with each individual beat (at 120 beats a minute, the truth keeps building and building).  30 minutes into the experience, my friend became overwhelmed and he resisted the message. I usually trip alone and plan on times I will not be interrupted and have someone present in the next room to talk to if I need it.  My compatriot was deep in the trance until his roomate began banging loudly on the wall and shouting 'turn the fucking music down' (even after I specifically told everyone in the house how important it was not to interfere in any way and if they did to be nice about it).  This broke the trance and flow of the trip as I turned the music off and turned it back on at a lower setting.  <br/>
<br/>
Now a child crying, people arguing and the upstairs neighbor could be heard with the music.  I was not in the state of mind now to really help him out.  I was out of my trance as well and now just concerned with getting him back.  The music had also taken on a darker edge as Tribes of Neurot and Download were now on the set list.  After 10 minutes of trying to get him back in the trance, he was totally gone and I was brought back into reality and had a fairly clear head though still 'messed-up'.  I'll leave a few things out, however the only thing he repeated were 'oh god, make it stop, make it stop, kill me'.  <br/>
<br/>
I had to leave him alone while his roomate and her kids were taken out of the house for safety reasons as he was getting very agitated and walking around, they drove me home so I could try to salvage the rest of my trip.  Two large men were called to make sure he didn't do anything to extreme.  Needless to say, he scared everyone as he had the look of a frightened animal on his face and was very disoriented.<br/>
<br/>
As a follow up, he is not mad at me, yeah!  I feel in time, once he integrates the experience, he will come out a stronger person.  He recieved contact and will probably never be the same again.<br/>
<br/>
I left and spent the rest of the night having a wonderful conversation with a girl I have been seeing and enjoyed the connection.  She did not know I was under the influence until I told her.  Being around authentic, caring people is a great way to enjoy the come down.<br/>
<br/>
I have done this and many other visionary drugs at such doses although I have prepared myself for it over many years through lucid dreaming, meditation, education, a few harrowing trips and real life sober experiences.  Here are some of the fine points I follow:<br/>
<br/>
1.  Respect it and take it very seriously.  Prepare for the trip like I'm about to die.  Take inventory of my life and reflect in the miorror of introspection prior to the experience.  I can not take the petty games and ambitions of my life with me on the journey.  Don't do this with the intention of seeing pretty colors and tripping.<br/>
<br/>
2.  Research and listen to others who have done it.  Become extremely familair with Ayahuasca for several weeks before the experience.<br/>
<br/>
3.  Don't fight it or resist.  Do not question the higher awareness, sit in silence and listen to the message.  Ayahuasca will show me heaven and hell and everything in between.  It will show me what it feels I need to see.  Ayahuasca is something to be experienced, not interracted with.  I can not put my will or ego in opposition to it.<br/>
<br/>
4.  The ayahuasca experience is best experienced in one flowing uniterrupted trance.  Make a time where others will not intrude on me or change the setting.  I prefer a totally dark room or black lights and music.  If I feel myself wanting to turn on lights, turn the music off, etc relax and let the experience swollow me whole and resist that temptation, find my way back to trance.  Mystical Sun's music was made for this experience.  The layers of sound are unreal and the message great.<br/>
<br/>
4. Be grateful this sacred root is available and do not jeopordize it by doing it for the wrong reasons.  <br/>
<br/>
As for me, I will never share this awesome truth with anyone again unless they are willing to commit to walking the path before drinking the elixer of life.<!-- End Body -->
