Around six o'clock in the afternoon Stumpy The worm called me in the kitchen to kick off the drop time.  We were taking AMT tonight and the word was that this stuff could last up to 12 hours.  We also knew not to eat much before the drop time because it would increase the nausea symptoms.   The day was old but the night was creaping around the corner.  6:15 AMT was successfully consumed.  My mindset was good and I was ready for this long adventure.  We had to mix it with everclear because it doesn't disolve in water.  It wasn't properly measured but we were sure the dosage would be around 40 mg.  It was my first time and soon enough to be my last.  I took fifteen mg over the estimated dosage.<BR>
<BR>
An hour passes and Stumpy is hugging the toilet.  Omar the omniscient shows up at fifteen after seven and drops 10 mg more than me.  The nausea was really bad but I kept it down.  I felt weighed to the ground and I knew I wasn't going anywhere  for a long time. 9:00 rolls around, Omar, stumpy and I watched tv while triping on certian motions in the room. I've experienced mushroom, x, and 5Meo-Dipt last semester but this was on a totally different level.  My vision was really blurry and I was clumsy as hell.  It was like being drunk and blind.  Stumpy started to get all excited and hyper while he paced around the room smikering with amazement.  He said he was seeing trailers all over.  Omar was feeling lazy like me but I got up anyway to get the blood flowing.  I started to get a familiar tingling sensation in my head and down my back.  It was like x but without the energy.<BR>
<BR>
ten o'clock pops up and my mind starts to fluster.  I couldn't keep up with all the thoughts, trips, and sounds.  Stumpy and I decided to take a stroll outside. This was the longest journey of the evening. We found ourselves at the swings and gave it a try. Pure joy! Must swing on AMT. After the swing we chilled in the house for quite a while. This is when the visual really started kicking. Hundreds of faces were in the floor. Omar was seeing all sorts crazy shit through a punch-ball ballon hoopty fill to the max. Hoopty was twigging on the baloon. Stumpy The worm was trpping out in the corner while I blew the baloon and punch the shit out of it. It was pretty frigin' triped out.<BR>
<BR>
Summary:<BR>
<BR>
Overall AMT kicked my ass.  After seeing skulls, scary faces, and Lucafer in the sky I would have to say it was pretty evil trip.  My head hurt for four hours and I smoked a pack and a half of moqwas.  Every time we smoked dank we would trip 10X as much.  It was crazy watching the movies and tv inside a balloon.  I think people with open minds and creative thoughts could really expand on this drug.  It's back to mushrooms for me but for stumpy and Omar, they'll repeat.  the end.<!-- End Body -->
