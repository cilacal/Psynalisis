I took 16mg of 2C-E(hydrochloride I presume) in water at 1:15 PM on a Saturday, on an empty stomach. (ate last at about 7 PM the previous day)  It had a very bitter taste, but was surprisingly bearable.  The taste had, to my surprise, what Shulgin calls 'character.'  I was in my room with four good friends, all of whom were taking 2C-T-7, in dosages between 20mg and 24mg.  Another friend took 18mg of 2C-B but had to leave when she was coming down (about four hours) to go somewhere.  This was one of a series of such gatherings in my room, and I was somewhat more stressed the morning of than I usually am.  I had had a very difficult week and I received some upsetting e-mails that morning.  In retrospect, I do not think that this significantly affected the experience.<BR>
<BR>
This was my first time taking 2C-E.  Prior to this, I had taken mushrooms four times, mescaline(in the form of San Pedro) twice, 2C-T-7 three times, and 2C-B twice.<BR>
<BR>
No effects to speak of were noticed for a little over an hour, but at about T+1:10 I suddenly felt what seemed to be a great deal of pressure on my chest, and a slight loss of breath.  I always experience this to some degree on psychedelics, but this was the most intense I ever felt it.  It accompanied a sudden appearance of definite but mild visuals.<BR>
<BR>
By T+2:00 it was fully active, a little more so than I had expected.  For a while, it was not entirely pleasant, but at some point after that, I don't remember when exactly, the pressure on my chest went away and, along with it, all the negative thoughts and feelings I was experiencing.  This may have had something to do with a cigarette I smoked; I don't remember which happened first.  It is worth noting that I do not smoke, but I find that it helped significantly with regulating my breathing on 2C-B and 2C-T-7.<BR>
<BR>
I do not remember much of the experience before the chest sensation abated, but after that my room seemed to light up significantly and I was overcome with complete euphoria for most of the rest of the day.<BR>
<BR>
The walls of my room seemed to fall away or become irrelevant, and I was able to immerse myself, at will, in huge and thoroughly gorgeous visuals that would expand to the edge of the room and beyond.  There were several flowers in a vase, and if I looked at them for half a second it would seem as if my room was surrounded by a spectacular jungle, right out of a child's fantasy.  Closed-eye visuals were equally fantastic but less profound.  I prefered to keep my eyes open.<BR>
<BR>
I became filled with a sense of awe at all living things, all of reality in fact, and it became harder and harder to find anything truly wrong with the universe.  Physical objects, merely by existing, glowed and danced with self-understanding.<BR>
<BR>
At this point of the experience I realized that there was something satisfying about this drug that I had found missing in 2C-B and 2C-T-7, as opposed to mushrooms and mescaline.  I never completely identified what it was.  The particular sense that all things were dancing to some barely heard music that resonated through the fabric of existence was something I had not experienced in a long time, and it was very welcome.<BR>
<BR>
I did not make any serious attempts to produce any drawings or music, but I feel it would have been effortless.  I entertained the idea of finding a large canvas and a human-sized bucket of blue paint, and was disappointed at the infeasability of it.  I even had in mind exactly what shade I would have used, and the patterns that I would make, but it was not possible and my imagined artwork faded from mind.  I proposed to my friends that psychedelia is the mind desiring to be raised to the same level as the other organs--in other words, everything the mind (to be distinguished from the brain, memory, etc.) does is impermanent, but in a psychedelic state, this seems more tragic than it normally does.  Hence the strong desire to paint and to write ideas down on paper.  After a moment's consideration, I realized that this deep desire of the mind to manifest its actions physically is always present, and is responsible for all of art and modern science.<BR>
<BR>
I had many deep thoughts that day, but unlike most of my experiences on 2C-B and 2C-T-7, I was not troubled by any of them, at least not to the point of experiencing any anxiety.  I found myself making frequent analogies to organized religion.  For instance, when one friend made some kind of request, perhaps to change the volume of the music, several people got up to change the volume, but quickly disagreed on whether it was supposed to be turned up or down, and continued to argue while ignoring the protests of the person who made the initial request.  I said, 'This is how religions get started.'<BR>
<BR>
As another example, I have always known that one of my windows behaves very strangely, and will often slide upwards significantly if pulled slighly.  For some reason, this particular day, on 2C-E, was the first time that it ever occurred to me that this was a major violation of the laws of physics.  One of my friends calmly explained to me that the window had counterweights and showed me where they were.  I couldn't stop laughing--I had religiously avoided questioning the behavior of my window but I had been set free from my ignorance.  I couldn't avoid making the obvious analogy.<BR>
<BR>
My thoughts of this nature largely centered on the ways in which governments are formed and become repressive, and how people decide that war is necessary.  It seemed that nobody who had experienced something as grand as my 2C-E experience could ever feel that there was no alternative to hurting another person.  But through all this I maintained a realistic view of the world, that things aren't perfect, that not everything is immediately feasible.(like the bucket of paint)  The solution is obvious, however: brilliance.  Every human being is capable of magnificent creativity but often uses it in the service of anger, judgment, money, or manufacturing neuroses to make their lives more interesting.  Or worse, they convince themselves that they aren't special at all.  We are smart enough, I realized, and we have the technology, to end much of the daily tragedy on this planet.<BR>
<BR>
All of these thoughts were powerful but positively directed.  They were all about major problems but there was always a solution waiting.  I had a strong sense that everything was going to be OK.<BR>
<BR>
A couple more points that didn't fit in above.  There was an intense heightening of taste--I was very conscious of the chlorine in the tap water, and all the food I had was absolutely amazing.  There was some nausea during the first two or three hours but it went away and I had no trouble eating whatever I wanted to.  I was ravenously hungry afterwards, more than I ever remember being after a psychedelic experience.  Also, the paranoia at having to interact with the outside world wasn't that intense, but it was definitely something to worry about.  During the peak I was very concerned about running into a disapproving person on the way to the bathroom, but this was mostly because I was repeated failing to stop smiling.<BR>
<BR>
The whole experience lasted about six or seven hours after ingestion, although there were mild effects for a few hours afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
If I had to rate 2C-E, I would have to give it 'eleven thumbs up,' to quote Homer Simpson.  At this level, it was a great visual experience, great for talking with friends, great gustatory experience, great for having life-changing thoughts, great for maintaining my sense of security throughout.  Great in general.  Perhaps I will find something flawed about this drug in later experiences, but for now I can't think of anything wrong with it, except that the first two hours are a little unpleasant.  It's my new drug of choice as long as I can't find any mushrooms and I don't feel like drinking green slime.<!-- End Body -->
