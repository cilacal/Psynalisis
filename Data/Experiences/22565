Friday night march 28, 2003 I took AMT for the first time ever. Me and four of my friends. We were going to the science museum for my friends 18th birthday. Right when I took it, it tasted like shit. After 20 minutes we all got on the train. I felt really nauses the hole way to the science museum. We got there and I still felt sick. All my friends wanted to smoke weed I was like I'm going to die. So I didn't I felt nauses for about 3 hours then I throw-up. I felt better so I was like 'fuck it' I'm gonna smoke. <BR>
<BR>
Right after I'd smoked I felt way better and I began to trip (really hard). We went to the Tool laser show after 10 minutes I had to leave it because it was really scary. I went to the laser show a couple of times before on acid and it was great, but this time was way to much. I felt like I took 10 tabs and was sick at the same time. It just kept getting worse! I couldn't talk right and I thought I was going to have a heart attack. I freaked out so much that I called my parents and told them I was on some crazy drug and I was really sick. They picked me up around 12:00 P.M. It started to go away by the time they got me. I stayed up until 4A.M. then went to sleep for 3 hours. I felt like shit all day saturday and sunday and now it's monday and I still feel sick. All my friends that took it are fine but they said that they would never take it again because it was just way to much. Because of that experience I'm never doing drugs ever again... And I'm not smoking weed for at least a couple of months.<!-- End Body -->
