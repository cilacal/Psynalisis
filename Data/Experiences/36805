 <span class='erowid-warning'>[Erowid Note: 
The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]</span>  <br>
<br>
I was at a friend's house, and she has scripts for Methylphenidate and Amphetamine [both generic] that we had decided to use recreationally. I had never taken close to as much as I have in this report In the experiance described in this report, I had a true high. Previously, I had only taken modest amounts Amphetamine [30mg-100mg], and gotten little buzzed. I had never taken Methylphenidate before.<br>
<br>
T+0:00 -- To start off, I snorted a line made up of 1 pill of Amphet (30mg) and 1 pill of Methylphenidate (5mg). My nose was stuffy, and it was pretty foolish/careless of me to do. I should have rethought that. <br>
<br>
T+0:10 -- I felt a tiny bit from the pills I insnufflated before. Not really a rush, or a burst, but just a jumpy feeling. Mild hyperactivity, I suppose, with a bit of paranoia. I jumped at my reflection in the mirror.<br>
<br>
T+0:20 -- I'm normal again. Surprise, surprise. I take another 2 Methylphenidate pills [total 10mg] and 1 of Amphetamine [30mg], this time the pills were broken in half, and swallowed orally. This is how I'll be taking the pills for the remainder of night.<br>
<br>
T+0:25 -- Still feeling normal, as I only swallowed the pills 5 minutes ago. After thinking for a bit after I swallowed the pills,  I just decided I want to get really 'tweaked' or high, whatever you'd like to call it, I just wanted to get more than the small buzz I had originally dosed for. So I swallowed another 3 pills Methylphenidate [total 15mg] and planned on another 3 more for later. I took 3 Amphets [total 90mg] planned on another 2 [total 60mg] for later.<br>
<br>
T+0:40 -- I don't feel anything from the pills I took at +0:20 or +0:25 yet. I had eaten lunch 4 hours prior. My stomach felt 'normal', like in the middle. I'm not nearly full or stuffed, but I have something in there. I'm not on a totally empty stomach, but it's empty enough. I anticipate the pills will be kicking in soon.<br>
<br>
T+0:50 -- I feel the smallest inkling of a rush. I have the mild hyperactivity back from before, but on top of that is a tiny rushing feeling. The first group of pills I ate was kicking in. I took the 15mg Methylphenidate and 60mg Amphetamine I planned on at +0:25. I promised myself no more, and repeated it a few times to make sure I didn't pop more on impulse when I'm tweaking.<br>
<br>
T+1:00 -- I now fully feel the +0:20 dose and the +0:25 dose. I am on a speed/ritalin high, and it is recognizable. It's not a small feeling like +0:50, I'm now starting to really feel it.<br>
<br>
T+1:20 -- It's an hour since I first started seriously taking the pills, as opposed to my dumb insufflation before. Bam! I'm rushing. I have just an incredible, almost indescribable feeling. The best way to put it into words is to says that I've just got a great rush, or a burst, of euphoria and energy and just general good feelings. I'm energetic, and euphoric.<br>
<br>
T+2:00 -- I'm peaking on the last dose I took. Great feeling. Like how I described at +1:20, but much, MUCH more intense. I've got a big smile on my face, I'm slightly jumpy [I jumped at my reflection again, but I laughed pretty hard after I realized it was alright]. I'm feel very alert, but it's not bad, as it's the alert feeling plus the huge rush, and not just a jumpy alert feeling. All the feelings [slight paranoia, alertness, euphoria] are working together to become a nice rush describable only as 'rushing'. But it's very intense. A huge rush. I'm hot, so I drink water. I feel perfect in a minute. It's obvious that I'm on something, very obvious. I'm not even close to normal. Adrenaline's rushing, too, so I'm also feeling good physically. The sort of feeling where I just want to yell 'WHOOOOOOOO!'<br>
<br>
T+2:30 -- Pretty much the same feeling as before. I think I had just reached the plateau before, and now I think I'm going to begin to come down soon.<br>
<br>
T+3:00 -- It is now 3 hours since I took the first tiny, uneffective dose, and 2:40 since I started to really take the pills. I'm coming down. I'm not 'crashing' or feeling worn out yet. It's just a less intense feeling than the one before. It's wearing off. I still feel pretty good.<br>
<br>
T+3:45 -- I still have remnants of the high. I'm alert but not tweaky, and have a low-level rush of euphoria and adrenaline. Very happy. <br>
<br>
T+4:20 -- I haven't 'crashed' as I thought I would, and I don't think I will. Maybe I'm just lucky tonight. The high is definitely starting to leave. I do feel a nice little buzz, a small fraction of what I felt before, but the feeling is fading away, and I'll be sober soon.<br>
<br>
T+5:00 -- A pretty minor 'crash'. I'm just a little tired, and I want some more, but I'm not going to get myself get into that.<br>
<br>
And that ended the trip. All in all, I think the mix was a great feeling, better than either alone. I don't even take speed by itself anymore because I find that it's just jumpyness and alertness with no rush. I'd do this again, I'd take more though. Not that the dose wasn't enough this time, but I just want to work my way up and experience more and more. It's a wonderful mix of drugs for an occasional recreational break from reality, and it was pretty fun.<!-- End Body -->
