Background:<br>
I am a 22 year-old male working in India at a technical support call center.  I am originally from the USA and am working for an American company out here.  Recently on a trip back to the US to see my family, I ordered 100mg of 2C-I, as well as some other research chemicals.<br>
<br>
It was not until the night before I was leaving to return to India that I decided to try the 2C-I.  I had not tried the other chemicals yet either because frankly I was a bit nervous about it.<br>
<br>
As for my drug background, I smoke marijuana daily, and I take cocaine occasionally.  At this time, I had just returned from a vacation in the Carribean where I did quite a bit of coke for about a week straight.  It was a day or 2 later so I was not feeling any effects of the coke.<br>
<br>
I have taken E twice and both times it had no effect on me while my friends were tripping their heads off.  I have also tried acid 3 times and it did not affect me.  I am not sure if these drugs just do not affect me or if I just did not take enough.<br>
<br>
Anyway, the experience with 2C-I was like the extasy experience I never had...<br>
<br>
Preparation:<br>
I had 100mg of this stuff and this is a very small amount of off-white colored crystals.  The crystals are very sparkly and also very sticky.  It is difficult to work with and I had no accurate way to measure it, so I measured out 200ml of water and dissolved the entire 100mg of powder.  I shook it up for a long time.  It did not dissolve easily at all.  I let it sit for the day while I went out to dinner with my family.<br>
<br>
The Experience:<br>
I had a couple of glasses of wine with dinner so I decided to wait a bit before taking the 2C-I.  I was already a little nervous because I was leaving for India the next day and would not be back for another 6 months.  I still had a little bit of packing to do and I was also a bit stressed because I had not received my visa yet.  I was supposed to receive it the same morning I was to leave so there was always the chance I could miss my flight.  Anyway, what I'm trying to say is these were not the ideal circumstances to take this chemical, but I did not want to take it with me to India, so I had to try it at least once before I left.<br>
<br>
I measured out about 10ml, or 5mg, of the solution and drank it.  I rinsed it and made sure to get any residue from the shot glass I was using.  It was about 12:30AM at this point and my family was asleep.  I was still packing and I tossed on Napoleon Dynamite, which is a really trippy movie anyway.<br>
<br>
I read that it may take awhile to kick in, so I waited almost an hour.  I did not feel much so I took about another 10mg (20ml).  After about 10 more minutes, I started to get that funny feeling like 'oh shit, something's happening'.  I tried to relax and sat down to watch the movie for a bit.  I drank a few glasses of water, something I normally do when I start to feel nervous during a trip.<br>
<br>
After another 1/2 hour or so (about 1.5 hours from the first dose), I really started to feel the effects of this powerful drug.  I was nervous because it was impossible to ignore the effects.  It was winter time and my room was a bit cold.  My body became hypersensitive to this and I bundled up in sweatshirt and pants, etc.  My skin was very sensitive to the touch and it felt good to rub my hands together and on my arms and legs.<br>
<br>
I started feeling very happy and also a little psychotic at the same time.  It was a crazy, giddy sort of happiness.  When I checked myself out in the mirror my pupils were huge.  I did not really have any open eye visuals, certainly nothing that would qualify as a hallucination.  To me, it seemed like what extasy was supposed to be like.  I had a lot of energy and felt like dancing to loud music (which I could unfortunately not do because everyone in the house was sleeping).<br>
<br>
It was also easy to get lost in thought.  I found myself thinking about past experiences in my life and just feeling compassion for everyone I ever knew.  I thought about how much I loved my family and got really emotional.  But then I quickly snapped out of it and got into a crazy, energetic mood again.  I had to play my guitar for a bit, and then something a little embarassing happened.  I just could not resist hunting some porn and pleasuring myself.  I wish I could have shared the experience with a female.  The sexual energy was so intense, I could vividly fantasize about what I wanted.<br>
<br>
This is when I discovered the closed-eye visuals.  When I closed my eyes, it was like a random, bizzare-o dreamworld.  I honestly cannot describe it, but it made perfect sense in my mind.  I remember seeing these flowers that had women's heads in the middle, surrounded by the petals, like in a cartoon.  They were smiling at me and sending me telepathic messages.  This was around 3-4 hours into the experience and I really was feeling the full effects.  I laid in my bed with heavy blankets but I could not fall asleep.  When I closed my eyes, I went back to my fantasy world.  It actually felt like I was leaving my body.<br>
<br>
I basically went into this world and talked to the flower ladies.  We didn't say much, just sat and smiled at each other and felt wonderful.  I would take off on a whim of a thought and come back here and there but I distinctly remember these flower ladies.<br>
<br>
At some point I finally did fall asleep but it was not for a good 6 hours after I took the first dose, and I was still tripping.  The next morning I felt very aloof.  My body felt a little out of synch with my brain.  I just kind of felt drained by the whole experience, but it was very lovely and interesting.<br>
<br>
Summary:<br>
2c-I is a very powerful chemical.  I have a naturally high tolerance to most drugs I have tried and this had a very strong effect on me.  It can make you really think objectively about your life and your goals and analyze yourself.  I have studied out of body experiences (astral projection) and have even successfully had them, but this chemical went beyond just looking at myself sleeping.  When I closed my eyes, I really felt like I was in another world.<br>
<br>
The sexual energy and body high of this drug is really nice too.  Next time I go back to the US, I hope I can get a female friend of mine to trip on this with me.  It feels to me like how people normally describe extasy.  I think this can be a very dangerous drug for some people too.  I never lost control of my thoughts completely but I could see with a higher dosage how it would be easy to let the body high take you over.  Anyone who is going through tough emotional times should definitely not take this.  The amount required is so low that it is very easy to measure inaccurately and take too much.<br>
<br>
The other intimidating thing about 2C-I is the duration of the trip.  I tripped for at least a good 5 hours.  So when you get that 'oh shit' feeling, you know it's going to be with you for awhile.  By the time it wore off, I sort of missed the feeling though.<br>
<br>
Anyway, hopefully that was helpful to anyone interested in trying 2C-I and hopefully this chemical will not be criminalized.  I enjoyed my trip immensely but as with all chemicals, you have to be careful because everyone reacts differently.<!-- End Body -->
