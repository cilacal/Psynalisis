I think I messed everything up I could when testing 5-MeO-DMT so I won't take this as a normal trip with this substance.<br/>
<br/>
First Informations:<br/>
<br/>
22y Male, 280ish lbs of weight.<br/>
At Night in my (messy) Apartment<br/>
<br/>
Setting: Worked out and kinda rushed because I only have my short Weekend for research. My knowledge about analytical chemistry is wide but I learned, that this won't help me after the transition from Chemical to Biology (which was my Nose).<br/>
<br/>
I had no tripsitter which came out as the worst mistake.<br/>
-----------<br/>
<br/>
I was very interested in tryptamines for a long time but I never took the Chance when it was there. Mostly out of Respect or my tight schedule. Finally my interest fell on the legal(ish) research chemical drugs and I read much about the whole scene. I found some interesting Psychoactive RC's so after I read many exp-reports and chemical information I ordered some minor amounts of 4-AcO-DMT, 2C-C and the 5-MeO-DMT.<br/>
<br/>
My Drug experience isn't that large. I like amphetamine and dissociatives (such as Ketamine). I never had trouble with them.<br/>
<br/>
So I got my package. At weekend I decided to start with the 5-MeO-DMT. On internet threads I found out a nasal dosage of 20-25mg for an average skinny boy. Because I know about my higher tolerance from other substances and cus I'm a lardy-ass chunk I thought it wouldn't be bad to start with a higher dose.<br/>
<br/>
I snorted 30mg which I weighed on a very fine scale.<br/>
<br/>
It hit me after seconds. I lay myself on my bed and was hoping for a nice visual and spiritual trip. But nothing of this came. What came were the alarm signals of my body. My Heart was beating so fast I thought I gonna flatline soon. 'You hit an overdose' that came in my mind. My first reaction in overdose cases would be forced vomiting but I knew that wont help because I insufflated the substance. I just kept breathing. <br/>
<br/>
'That's it. I'm gonna die' was a hot topic in my head. The substance burned in my throat and my jaw got numb. I rose and grabbed my emergency bucket because of imminent vomiting. The reflex came and my body acted on its own. But nothing came out. I couldn't stop the vomiting reflex and it became painful. I tried to calm myself down with large and slow breathing lying on my back. The vomiting reflex came again often. I felt that my Heart was on its limit. I'm sure that I whispered to myself 'I don't wanna die' many times. I thought about calling someone for help. Just calling a friend or even an ambulance only survival was in my Head but in the end I tried to calm down again. I set my mind only on my breathing for a felt hour and heartbeat finally slowed down. It may sound weird but I was really happy in this state of calming down, almost euphoric just because I got rid of this bad condition. I even giggled a bit which felt very comfortable. <br/>
<br/>
The awkward part of coming down began. I talked with myself about the fear and the whole trip. This was the part that my tripsitter could have done before it got worse... If I had one. Anyway I was totally aware that talking to myself is not a common state but it helped me to fully calm down. Some residual sick feelings were present but I could walk to the toilet and even read a magazine. My mind and body was back to normal.<br/>
<br/>
The shocking part was when I looked at the clock. This was just the timescale of barely a hour. It felt like it was the whole night...<br/>
<br/>
I was worn out but my mood was surprisingly happy (maybe the joy of survival). I browsed the internet for a bit and chatted with a friend about my trip. I felt so stupid because I totally rushed the research with bad settings and an inaccurate dosage. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">I totally rushed the research with bad settings and an inaccurate dosage.</div></div><br/>
<br/>
I had a refreshing sleep of aprox. 8 hours and never felt any further health problems.<br/>
<br/>
This was last month and I did not touch the other two substances in the meantime.<br/>
 <br/>
The vial in which I store the little 5-MeO-DMT bag got a huge red exclamation mark on the label and I put it in the dark back of my safe. As far as I'm concerned it can rot there forever.<br/>
<br/>
My interest in this substance is totally gone. But my wish for a nice visual and a bit psychological trip is still there. When I feel ready I continue with other substances. But this trip showed me that I have to be more careful.<!-- End Body -->
