Precursor: I have used many substances multiple times and in varying doses in the past, including: LSD, mushrooms, various 2C-X, ketamine, MXE, MDMA, methylone, opioids, amphetamines, and DMT (once).<br>
<br>
I am not trying to write an intricately detailed trip report. Rather than give a minute-to-minute report, I will touch on main points and feelings.<br>
<br>
Setting + Mindset: It was early evening after I had come home from work (I live in a house with my mother and a younger sister). I currently work in retail, which I am quite unhappy with based on pay/hours/customer service. I was tired and in relatively low mood after just completing an 8-day work shift.<br>
<br>
Preparation: None. I hadn't eaten anything for at least 24hrs prior.<br>
<br>
T: 0:00:  At about 6pm, I ingested an oral dose of MXE. Speculating is irresponsible, and I did not measure, however based on past measurements and how much material I had left, it was between 25-40mg. I laid down in my darkened bedroom for a couple of hours, mostly resting and having mild introspection about my job and my future.<br>
<br>
T+ 2:00:  I was mostly down/had small lingering effects from the MXE when I decided to dose 2 blotters; 1mg of 25i and 150ug of LSD; sublingually and simultaneously.<br>
<br>
Effects:<br>
<br>
After about 25 minutes, I started to feel the come up. During the come up, which lasted approximately 30-40 minutes, I had very strong sexual feelings. For the sake of good taste I will not be too graphic, but during the come-up, sex & videos on my TV was all I was focused on. After I was able to climax, sex didn't enter my mind for the rest of the experience.<br>
<br>
During the come-up, I also noticed very strong waves in my peripheral vision. Colors on my large plasma television were greatly intensified. I was able to put on some episodes of the cartoon Archer, as I sometimes like viewing animation during psychedelic trips.<br>
<br>
Strangely, when I was watching the television, the videos remained in focus, however when looking around, the strength of the waves in my vision made it hard to recognize my room. Colors were very intense and bright. I also experienced frequent small, bright specks/flashes of light in my vision without any source.<br>
<br>
At times, the visuals became overwhelming and I felt exhausted, so I laid spread-eagle on my floor with my eyes closed. I felt like I was able to move, however I just laid still for 30+ minutes. There were some CEVs; some strong but not quite as intense as what I've previously experienced on high doses of mushrooms. However, I had stimulating full-body sensations, and at certain points, I felt as if I was no longer in my body. This feeling would go away whenever I opened my eyes.<br>
<br>
I eventually decided to go to the kitchen to get something to eat. Stopping in the bathroom to look in the mirror was a very strange experience. At this point, my vision was one big wave. I recognized myself as a person, but not quite as me. I also had 2-3 second tracers, where I would move something or wave my arm, and then see the same motion happen again seconds later.<br>
<br>
I did manage to grab some food from the kitchen, but it was quite difficult to eat without making a mess considering my hand-eye coordination was so heavily compromised. When closing my eyes so as to not focus on the visuals, it seemed my sense of touch, taste, and hearing were relatively normal.<br>
<br>
I had some of what was left over from a grocery store rotisserie chicken, and when I stopped to look at some of the remains rather than just feeling and eating by touch, the remains appeared to grow in front of me and form some new living creature.<br>
<br>
T+ 6:00: I noticed a clock in my kitchen; it was 3.5 hours since I ingested the 25i and LSD. I decided I would go outside to see what it would be like. Stepping out my backdoor onto a small open patio, I became disoriented. Everything was a wavy blur, and I would think I'd take 2 steps, but yet looking back at the door, it seemed as if I was 15 feet away. Looking over towards a neighbors' house, they had a floodlight on. It seemed as if it was a fast moving, undulating lighthouse, with the lights' brightness and motion constantly shifting and flowing over the grass and trees.<br>
<br>
One aspect that I was surprised with during this whole experience was my headspace; I never felt euphoric, anxious, or scared. I just thought of how our personal perception as humans is our own personal reality; two small substances was enough to completely change how light effected my eyes and how/what I was seeing, and I thought of what reality could actually be like, or even if there really is one <i>true</i> reality, when not viewed through human perception.<br>
<br>
T+ 8:00: I felt as if I had come down even though I still had moderate OEVs; this was just in comparison to the spectacular visuals I had earlier. At this time, I laid in bed and spent some time viewing different desktop backgrounds from my computer on my television. They were still much more colorful than normal, and still undulating as if they were animated.<br>
<br>
T+ 8:30: I turned off my equipment and tried to sleep. I'm usually completely down from 25i after about 6 hours, but I still had some CEVs and strange thoughts occurring, which I believe was from the LSD. One interesting aspect that occurred is that I would often <i>think</i> of a huge range of auditory notes, ranging from lows to highs in strange orders, without actually hearing them from any external source.<br>
<br>
T+ 10:30: At 4:30 am, approximately 8 hrs after the 25i/LSD ingestion, I took 2mg of klonopin to help me sleep.<br>
	<br>
Overall, I have never had a stronger visual experience on any other drug or combination of drugs. Interestingly, my headspace remained relatively calm and neutral throughout the entire experience, with almost no deep emotional introspection. There appears to be a huge synergy between 25i and LSD, and I believe the MXE beforehand played a role in the experience. I have had no after effect from the experience, aside from feeling lethargic the next day, most likely due to the large clonazepam dose.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't suggest this combination except that I already had experience with and knew how I react to different doses of 25i, LSD, and MXE beforehand. Otherwise, this could have been a very difficult experience.<!-- End Body -->
