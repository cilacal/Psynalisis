<!-- End DoseChart  -->
<!-- Start Body -->
7:04 - took 25mg of dramamamine, hoping to thwart any nausea.<br>
<br>
7:09 - Held a few ml in under my tongue make sure I wouldn't have any kind of bad reaction. Taste isn't bad, ALMOT tasteles. I had dilluted it to about .3mg per ml in distilled water.<br>
<br>
7:15  - Nothing happening, so I'm assuming there to be no bad reactions. Swallowed what was in my mouth gonna give it another couple minutes before I down the rest.<br>
<br>
7:20 - Drank half of the rest.<br>
<br>
7:25 - Drank the remaining liquid.<br>
<br>
7:32 - Smoked a cigarette, no particular reason other than to keep Acetylcholine receptors going :P (Yes, I'm a regular smoker, so they don't really have any noticable effect on me)<br>
<br>
7:35 - Pulse rate 88 beats per minute. Slightly higher than usual possibly due to the cigarette and apprehensiveness)<br>
<br>
7:39 - notice some slight residue (assumed to be 2C-E) in the container I drank it from. Poured this into my soda pop.<br>
<br>
7:46 - Forgot about my soda, finishing it off. Still just sitting at the computer not feeling much of anything. Pluse rate is 76 bpm, about normal for me.<br>
<br>
7:59 - Effects starting, for sure.<br>
<br>
8:33 - Wondering about product quality. Im not as up as i thought I should be at this point. Feels more tryptamine-ish to me than I expected. Ive only taken one phenethylamine though (mescaline), so maybe thats the deal here. Peripheral visual effects are becoming more prominent all the time. Colors are very much brighter and<br>
enhanced.<br>
<br>
8:50 - Muscles in my legs seem to be twitching a lot. I feel like I should be making note of the mental aspect more than I am, but I dont really feel there is much of one (at this dose anyway). My mental processes seem for the most part uninterrupted. Much less awe inspiring than, say, psilocybin was for me.<br>
<br>
9:03 - I feel as though this isn't going to go much further. Watching the news is interesting, I feel like i can see emotions in people faces and actions very easily. Very clear headed.<br>
<br>
9:22 - Waves of....something... come over me and then pass. With the waves come an electrical feeling, i feel as though nothing I say can explain this duely so I shall not explain. Time seems to pass very quickly. Or is it very slowly? --- Looking back on this time seems to move very fast when I'm looking in retrospect, but in the moment time passes very slowly. Quite paradoxal especially in the state I was in the time :).<br>
<br>
10:01 - Serotonin is a strange neurotransmitter.<br>
<br>
10:46 - I was laying on my bed listening to Led Zeppelin, eyes closed, on my back, when suddenly what seemed like an 'impact' hit near my head, it jolted me up. I beleive the term is myoclonic twitch.<br>
<br>
11:01 Havn't taken the pulse in a while. 72 bpm. Lower than before if I remember correctly. Starting to come down, I think. Time for another cigarette.<br>
<br>
<br>
Basically from here on out the effects stayed the same, waning as the hours went by. I sit here at 2:59, 95% back to baseline cleaning up the notes I took. The whole trip seems to have been very tryptamine like to me, or rather it reminded me more of<br>
my tryptamine experiences than it did phenethylamine. I didn't do a particularly good job documenting this experience and I think that hints to the nature of it. I didn't want to be assed with logging the effects, I just wanted to lay there and experience<br>
them. My leg muscles were twitching throughout the experience and that just stopped about a half hour ago. My jaws were generally clenched unless I was thinking about it, and at times I had a hint of that tightness in the chest that I had heard some other<br>
people talk about. All in all it was interesting, but not quite as enlightening as my previous experiences with other psychedelics. I do intend to repeat at a higher dosage.<br>
<br>
Oh and as I said before, I know I didn't do the best job documenting this but I left it, for the most part, as is. I chose the title I did because for some reason it was echoing around in my brain a lot during the trip.<!-- End Body -->
