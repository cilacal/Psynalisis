There are some places you wish you never visit ever.  About 20 hits of 5-MeO-DMT snorted is one of those places.  I have never snorted this before, so I thought now would be a good time.  I smoked it before, about 200 or 250mg, but it was over the course of 3 hours.  With a five to ten minute high, it's controllable.<BR>
<BR>
I snorted about 25mg.  It still was barely hitting me.  I know it requires more if you snort to get high, so I took 50mg more.  It just starts hitting me, and I take another 25mg about.  Then it started hitting me hard.  Probably too hard.  I was pacing my room in this frantic 'OUT OF MY MIND' dance.  Then, it was too much.  It was way too much.  I knocked on my neighbor's door in my dorm suite.<BR>
<BR>
'What?  You want us to turn down the music?' he said.<BR>
<BR>
I was like, 'No, no, I....  took too many....  too much shit....  I'm just having a bad trip.  Is it okay if I just hang out in here and calm down?  I just want to calm down.'<BR>
<BR>
He was a nice guy and he let me hang out.  He was interested in knowing what I was feeling like.  He didn't quite understand that I wanted to be completely sober at that moment.  I told him I had intense dissociation and intense visuals.  He told me to go throw up, and I went to the bathroom and tried to puke.  It wouldn't matter, though, since I snorted it, but they didn't know that.  I thought that puking might cause the nostrils to shoot it out, since sometimes puke goes through your nose.  I puked, and it wasn't much.  I puked a little bit again.  Instead of feeling relieved, I only felt more sick.  I stood up, and another friend said, 'You don't look so good....  dude, you were puking blood.'  I washed my hands in the sink.  He said, 'Don't worry, it's only water.'  I was very scared, extremely dissociated.  They alerted the Resident Assistants who called the cops.  They also brought me back to my room.<BR>
<BR>
The RA said, 'Dude, just tell me what you took,' and I told him.  The paramedics came with a stretcher and took my blood pressure.  It was 300 to 340, 'Twice or three times what it normally should be.'  I was sweating intensely, and the hallucinations became overly intense, as I lost familiarity with everything that I once knew.  I also lost all color and became extremely pale.  The paramedics were ready to take me to the hospital, but I had to sign a waiver because I just wanted to stay in my room.  The thought that I could die from this was pacing through my mind, but with the cops and paramedics there, I felt a bit more secure.  I just wanted to be in my room and stay in a familiar place.<BR>
<BR>
I finally came down, and the cops left.  After that, I hung out with some friends to just try and mellow out...  But, what I went through was probably the worst hell of my life ever.  When I overdosed on Coricidin pills (just 8 of them), it was horrible, but this was at least 10 times worse than that.  I felt so, so, so sick.  I was afraid of death just reaching up and grabbing me...  But, I'm alive.  This psychonaut lives another.  As for that, I wish you all the best of tripping, and particularly the safest of all tripping.<!-- End Body -->
