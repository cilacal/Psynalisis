I took a single 1200&#956;g blotter of 25-i at 12 a.m. I placed it under my tongue, sat back on the bed and watched some youtube videos while I waited.  After about 20 minutes, I started feeling a little nauseous and had a tingling sensation in my legs, lower back, and groin.  The feeling was similar to being sexually aroused but a bit weighed down.  I felt a bit dizzy and my vision was a bit blurred.  I knew the signs were there but I decided to keep the blotter under my tongue for another 20 min.  At 12:40 a.m., a group of us went to a trance show at a club.  <br>
<br>
At 1 a.m., the nausea was more intense but not unbearable and had no trouble paying for entrance to the club.  When I walked into the club the lights and fog machine gave me the feeling like I was tripping, but not too strong.  The light show and music got me into the feeling and I started wondering if I was tripping or the light show was just really good.  <br>
<br>
Around 1:30, I went to the bathroom and suddenly, boom, the trip was on.  The visuals were strikingly similar to my LSD experiences, but I still had an uncomfortable weighted and chemical feeling.  I began having difficulty reading peoples intentions and emotions.  I felt the need to get outside so I took a walk.  <br>
<br>
At 2:30 a.m., I was peaking and found an isolated stairwell where I sat down and gathered myself.  I was experiencing extremely intense introspective thoughts, reflecting on my friends, family, life decisions.  I couldn’t escape the feeling that had to get something out, some negative emotions or feelings.  The visuals at this point were amazing almost identical to my experiences with LSD. <br>
<br>
At 2:45 a.m. I met up with the group at a 7-Eleven.  The visuals were even more amazing now I had a visceral revulsion to drinking anything.  Everything turned into a cartoon everyone looked nearly two-dimensional.  I felt like I was in Grand Theft Auto. Everyone looked so cartoony I couldn’t believe it and got the giggles.  It got so intense I ended up going for another walk and found a small city park.  I’m certain that if I was in a more rave-friendly environment I would have stuck it out.  Unfortunately, I was surrounded by a bunch of drunk people.  In the park, I was propelled into an existential journey.  I became immensely depressed about the litter in the park.  I realized I needed to be more proactive in my life and setting goals.  I saw the potential of the city and people, even people out clubbing.  I just wanted everyone to have a good time and know their limits. The park was stunningly beautiful.  The visuals and experience left me in a euphoric state.  <br>
<br>
At 4 a.m. I headed back to the club and met up with the group. It was like being welcomed home into a happy family.  I haven’t experienced that level of euphoria since I took an eighth of magic mushrooms a few years ago.  I saw everyone in their place and fulfilling their role in the group dynamic.  I found my own place and realized I’d been neglecting my own identity as an individual in the group.  I closed my eyes and let the music take me away.  Found myself at peace, but knowing I have a lot of self-improvement to do.  I left the group one more time and walked around the club and found myself as an objective observer of everything. I was completely unaffected by the people there, it was as though I was in a bubble. I felt extremely confident and floated around for about 30 min before meeting back up with the group. We left the club, stopped by a park and enjoyed the evening.  I got home, watched Fantasia 2000 and the visuals maintained until I fell asleep.   <br>
<br>
The negative aspects of the trip were social anxiety, constipated feeling, nausea, nearly throwing up and a bit of depression influenced mostly by my environment.  <br>
<br>
The positive side: I haven’t had the desire for alcohol or cigarettes for a week now and I was drinking and smoking almost everyday before.  I also had the most amazingly trippy cartoon visuals ever and experienced intense euphoria nearly to the point of happy tears.  <br>
<br>
It was a very unique experience and I’m planning on taking another trip with it tonight at a beach rave!  I’ll post the follow up experience too. The total trip was around 7 hours.  The following two days I experienced lethargy but, on the whole a more proactive positive outlook on my life.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading, safe and happy tripping.  Words of caution, ease your selves into it.  Start with lower doses and go to a happy environment with like-minded people.  Appreciate yourselves as the individuals you are and the people in your life : ).  <br>
