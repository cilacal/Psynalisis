I received a gram of the legal AM-2201 synthetic cannabinoid from a highly reputable source. It appeared as a fine white powder with maybe just a hint of tan. After reading researching online quite a bit it was clear the normal dosage is somewhere between 0.5mg to 2mg at most and that higher dosage usually result in a highly intensive, LSD-like psychedelic experience. That's what I tried to achieve.<br/>
<br/>
Before and while taking this substance I hadn't consumed any other medical substances and last one was dried Salvia divinorum leaves a couple of days earlier.<br/>
<br/>
18:15 - I take the cover on my window down to keep it dark. Keep my door open as I'm alone at home. Prepare my bong and pad the bowl with some ash I had from previous sessions. I measure an exact 250mg and stack it up. Using a butane lighter I smoke the bowl. This takes me several hits due to the high amounts of powder.<br/>
<br/>
As soon as I finish exhaling the last one, I feel a little light headed. I stand up when I suddenly realize there is a serious lag or delay between what I'm actually doing and what I'm seeing.  I move my hand and only see it a couple of seconds later. My heart starts pounding so fast and hard and doesn't feel real.  <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text"> I move my hand and only see it a couple of seconds later. My heart starts pounding so fast and hard and doesn't feel real. </div></div> I decided to walk out of the room, but I turn around to get back to bed when I suddenly feel my body tingling. As soon as I turn around, time freezes and the only thing still going is the sound of me screaming for help in the background.  As of that moment, I no longer know who I am, where I am and what is real.<br/>
<br/>
The next thing I remember is seeing a 2D world made of colors splashing around. I am part of this world and have no physical form. I wonder to myself, is this really my life? Was there anything before? If so, was it all a dream? The colors melt and disappear, this makes me somewhat understand something is happening. The thought is echoing in my mind. I proceed and am reborn to another life where everything is made of colorful lines. It feels as if I was born, got old and died of age when I proceed to another world made of random patterns and a big red light blinking in the center of it. The thought that something is happening is back and I'm starting to understand where I am. The big red light blinking is my heart beating and I have a physical form. I wonder if I am asleep and if so, why am I not waking up? I feel as if my entire body is pressed against some hard surface. I later understand I managed to get to bed and I'm actually lying down with my face pressed against the bed. I move a finger and feel it, but can't really see anything. The rebirth and dying is happening again, again and again as if it happened a million times, and each time only a small detail changes. Only now I realize I'm going through some kind of seizure, but I don't remember I've taken anything or even who I am. <br/>
<br/>
I try to move and feel my body moving, so I try to get up when all of the sudden I see my room only for a second. I must have got up and managed to sit down, because now I can see parts of my room. I am still reborn again and again and every other moment I get a little lucid and understand where I am, only to sink back in to the dream and forget all about it. I start seeing more and more of my room, piece by piece. I feel sick and my mouth is dried. I look for my phone so I could call for help, but I sink back yet again. I find myself screaming for help, repeating the word 'HELP' again and again without any logic, as I'm alone at home. I only stop to vomit. I see my phone and pick it up, but I sink in again. The experience from now on is repeating itself. I get another lucid moment and see the phone in my hand. I try to call someone and the only number I remembered was a friend of mine. I call him and scream 'HELP' many times, but he doesn't understand what is going on. I manage to say 'AMBULANCE', which surprises me as I didn't know that word or thought I had any control over what I say. The phone hangs up and I start vomiting again. I get another call and answer it, it's my friend. He's telling me to unlock the door so the paramedics could get in. I sink back in again. I get another lucid moment and manage to get all the way to the door and unlock it. I can see everything in the house, no more colors, but it doesn't seem real. I'm made of Play-Doh. I sit down and wait for the medics. I try to hold myself, but as I touch my hand, the hair on it melts and I can feel and see it pouring down my hand. <br/>
<br/>
At this point all I want to do is to make it stop, even if I need to die to accomplish it. The medics and my friend arrive and I tell them what I took and where is the bag. They start asking me questions instead of treating me and I sink back in. I wake up in the hospital and this is the first time I see the time since the moment I started this session.<br/>
<br/>
21:55 - I have no idea where I am, but I remember who I am and what happened. I'm terrified. My friend tells me I'm in the hospital and that the police are testing the material. Apparently they thought it was cocaine for some reason.<br/>
<br/>
23:00 - After taking a lot of oxygen and having people talking to me to keep me lucid, I am mostly out of it.  My chest hurts so bad I want to cry and the doctor tells me I'm lucky I didn't have a heart attack. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text"> My chest hurts so bad I want to cry and the doctor tells me I'm lucky I didn't have a heart attack.</div></div><br/>
<br/>
01:00 - After lying to everyone about what I felt and how much I took, the doctor decides it's safe to let me go home. I get home and immediately fall asleep.<br/>
<br/>
11:00 (The next day) - I wake up in the living room after a night of horrible nightmares mainly of what I saw and felt while under the influence. I walk around the house and realize I vomited in the entrance to the house, in my room (multiple times on the bed and on the floor) and in my roommate's room, which I don't remember visiting.<br/>
<br/>
11:30 - Fully awake after drinking coffee. I'm really dizzy and my head hurts. Much more noticeable then the aftereffect of alcohol. I think I am fine and decide to write down this experience so people would be aware of the dangers.<br/>
<br/>
13:47 - I usually type really fast, but only now I finished typing it all. Still dizzy, head still hurts and I'm having difficulties concentrating.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusions:<br/>
This was the worst day of my life. It literally felt like forever. Even if I heal, it will always leave a mental scar.<!-- End Body -->
