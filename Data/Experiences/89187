I purchased JWH-250 thinking it was complete bullshit and I had wasted $25 on a gram, but it turned out to be the real deal in more ways than one.<br>
<br>
Experience One: Vaped off aluminum foil - 10 mg - Hit me with a quick, heavy head stone that left in about 60 minutes. It hits almost immediately and the stone is very much like a mid/high grade non-chronic weed stone with the easy ability to perform various things while stoned. Little cottonmouth, no desire for food.<br>
<br>
Experience Two: Ground the end of a cigarette into the powder and smoked the cigarette - 10 mg - Much of the same as experience one, again a very heavy head stone immediately. <br>
<br>
Experience Three: Digested - 15 mg - No acetone, no gelcaps, simply the powder sprinkled in your palm, then licked up. After about one hour I was thinking that this method would not work, and then I felt the semi-heavy confusion of mind that comes with a decent stone but the high begins almost 2 hours after ingestion and lasts 3 hours or so. The high is much more time oriented when ingested. In other words, I looked at the clock and it's 6:12. I look at the same clock 15 minutes later and it's 6:13. I was surprised how nice this works when ingested - DO NOT TAKE TOO MUCH.<br>
<br>
Experience Four: Snorted - 15 mg - This was really funny but should be heeded by all. I snorted this on the night before work and felt nothing. The next day, around noon, I was at work and I began to clear all of the snot out of my nose and swallowed it. After about 3-5 minutes I began to feel strange and in about 15 minutes I realized I was completely stoned. This really surprised me because I had to dodge being stoned at work for about 2 hours. This JWH-250 powder works like a charm and I think I'll get some more.<br>
<br>
WARNING: at doses of more than 15 mg the stone is very high and made me feel very uncomfortable. I would recommend no more than that and do not redose - especially if you are ingesting it.<!-- End Body -->
