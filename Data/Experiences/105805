I bought some clonazolam with the intention of taking it recreationally. Before this I've had experience with prescription benzodiazepines such as Xanax and also research chemicals such as the very potent flubromazolam.<br/>
<br/>
I read up on the web about this new benzo named clonazolam. It was a substitute for the now widely banned clonazepam. I decided to buy some 0.5mg capsules that later arrived in my mailbox. Impatient as I am I decided to try it out the day the package arrived.<br/>
<br/>
T+0:00: I'm in my room in front of my computer. I'm pretty relaxed as is, pretty stressed out about everyday life as usual though. No real anxiety to speak of other than some mild aftereffects from earlier flubromazolam use a week ago. I should say though that I have no real tolerance to speak of, as I take benzos very sporadically. I just got a capsule of 0.5mg clonazolam from my jar beside the computer and swallowed it. I'm a bit worried about tomorrow's university assignments but I guess there's no going back now. I turn on my music and await the effects.<br/>
<br/>
T+0:20: A feeling of slight nausea is creeping up on me. I've not eaten anything else in the past 4 hours so it shouldn't have anything to do with food. I'm also feeling a slight bit more relaxed than before the drop. I've heard other reports of people experiencing effects in as little as 15 minutes, so whether or not this is the beginning or not is yet to be found out.<br/>
<br/>
T+0:40: Much more relaxed than before. A bit of a heavy feeling in limbs. I tried to walk and motoring functions are still fine. Very slight euphoria and warmth. Mindset remains mostly unchanged. Familiar metallic taste in mouth just like you get when you've taken flubromazolam or flubromazepam.<br/>
<br/>
T+1:00: Tried walking again and motoring functions are slightly impaired. Nothing really noticeable. Even further relaxed than before with some difficulties finding words for what I'm trying to express in this text. All worries are essentially gone, which includes any stress I had about tomorrow. Feeling warmer and more euphoric than before. I'm experiencing little bit of dissociation like others have described this drug as being able to induce. Strong urge to go to bed and sleep, which probably has to do with the fact that it's currently 11:45 pm. Compared to flubromazolam the feeling of tiredness is not very pronounced. Compared to Xanax the heavy feeling is not very pronounced either, and the euphoria is not close to the same level as 1mg of Xanax would have given me at this point. I'm not really feeling the classic “benzed-out” feeling I usually do on regular doses of other benzos. I am however starting to feel a bit dizzy, which I've never experienced on a benzo before.<br/>
<br/>
T+1:35: Feeling extremely dizzy. Rest of the feelings are the same as earlier except for some weird abdominal pain. I'm guessing that this is due to an upset stomach. Can still walk properly without issues. Euphoria has decreased and succumbed to the annoying dizziness.<br/>
<br/>
T+2:00: Dizziness has stopped. The euphoria and warmth is completely gone. I'm feeling mostly tired and relaxed at this point. All feelings of dissociation is gone as well. I will go to bed and report back tomorrow.<br/>
<br/>
T+12:00: I'm still having that weird metallic taste in my mouth. I'm a bit drowsy as I usually am after eating benzos without much of a tolerance. All relaxing and stress reducing effects are gone now. The only effect I'm currently experiencing is drowsiness and the benzotaste in my mouth. I can however say that I slept like a rock. I fell asleep as soon as I went to bed and woke up at a reasonable time around 8 hours later. It was good sleep as well.<br/>
<br/>
All in all I can say that I was a bit disappointed. Coming from strong benzos like alprazolam, diazepam and flubromazolam, I do not personally think this benzo was worth the money. Sure, the relaxing effect was pretty pronounced, and I guess that if I was just looking for a pretty mild benzo to ease of everyday stress sometimes, this could probably work. Also, if I'd looking for a benzo that helps with sleeping this could probably work as well. I am usually a pretty light sleeper and I wake up several times a night. This night I had some very deep and refreshing sleep which was very nice indeed. I think I'm going to keep the rest of the package and take one of these when I have to sleep good, because these didn't have the same “hungover” effect as the flubromazolam had on me, which is pretty nice if you have to do something important the day after.<br/>
<br/>
Next time I'm probably going to ingest 1mg instead though, as I think 0.5mg was a bit too weak for my taste. I'm giving up on these as recreational though and sticking to them as a sleeping aid. It's possible that at higher doses it would have some nice recreational properties, but I'm not a fan of taking too much benzos and doing things I later regret.<!-- End Body -->
