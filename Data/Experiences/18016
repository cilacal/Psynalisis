It was a beutiful night in august, the location a magnificant psytrance festival. It was the night after my first 2CB hit, I'd taken approx 20mg in raw form and had fallen in love with the stuff, but I was sure I wouldnt be doing it again that night cos it had been so intense before,  before I knew it I'd eaten 1/2 an acid blotter though :), I was drunk and very high on fine hash, havin a amazing time listening to the music of demons and gods (or was it the other way round???!)... At this time I had never tried mescaline too, and I was well up for it, and we knew a man had been offering it before. We went to ask, the price was soo high 35euros a hit (!!!!) But I suppose its the price you pay without the right connections so me and a friend shared a hit, I had no doubts becuase the man was really trustworthy and his shrooms were good earlier :0--<BR>
<BR>
An hour later I was fealing midly tripped and very nice, and at this point I just thought FUCK IT! Its time to get mental! Minutes later I had more acid, some 2CB, MDMA powder and had shared some of my friends rather strong coke lines, we had some opium and a chillum which seemed only to make things easier to digest, there was no stopping me, I just ate away. Then the madness started! We'd put the hit of 2CB in a bottle which we shared (not wanting to have such an intense trip as the night before) which during the course of the night we started to refer to it as 'death water' it certainly was, every new swig sent me nearer the border of insanity, but I wasnt scared it just didnt seem like a bad trip was going to happen, but things changed..for the better I suppose---<BR>
<BR>
It started raining, a full on thunderstorm with maximum lightning, all at this mega psy-trance festival in a amazing location with a lake, the scene was awe-inspiring, a psychadelic wonderland with natures full lightshow, and the drugs effects were making my barin so aware I thought I was going to explode, I wandered about this war zone watching the lightning hit the dancefloor, I think by this time the music had been temporarily stopped, some of the lighting was striking unthinkably close to me, but I was so amazed by this full-on sensory assault that I just stood there, soaked to the bone, and smiled, giggled and laughed, it was by far the most absolutly amazing think i've ever experienced, I could'nt  stop smiling, my only anxious thoughts were to my mouth, I was sure it was going to split under the pressure of my grin, after maybe 10 hours or 2 minutes I started to slowly come down from this peak, I was SO wet! I just sat in a chaishop thinking for hours, then the sun came out and the party was back! I didnt stop tripping until mid day. <BR>
<BR>
I also couldnt really convey what I had experienced that night to anyone else for fear of ridicule, it seems easier months on and in writing, but it was something else. It was great. Every night was amazing, but I think the full moon and the electricity of the storm just made me into a beast, thank god the djs were playing the most fucked up twisted shit ever aswell, it certainly gave me a boost.  Sorry about the over use of the word 'amazing'! But it just...er.........was! And we threw away the remaining death water by the way....<!-- End Body -->
