Well, nobody has tried this yet, so...<BR>
<BR>
8:50PM<BR>
------<BR>
        I weigh out 6mg of 5-MeO-DIPT, chop it up into fine powder, and<BR>
divide it into two lines of approximately 3mg each. I divide each of these<BR>
in 2 again.<BR>
<BR>
8:53PM<BR>
------<BR>
        1.5mg up one nostril, 1.5 up the other! The smell/taste is similar<BR>
to DPT - or any other tryptamine for that matter. I'm glad that 5-MeO-DIPT<BR>
has a very low dosage range... it would not be pleasant to insufflate<BR>
large quantities of this. I have an immediate sense that 'something' is<BR>
coming, but the effects are not instantaneous.<BR>
<BR>
8:58PM<BR>
------<BR>
        Yuck! The drip from this stuff tastes very bad, and also is giving<BR>
a very uncomfortable burning sensation in the back of my throat. Neither<BR>
saline nasal spray nor drinking seems to help. I guess I just need to wait<BR>
it out.<BR>
<BR>
9:05PM<BR>
------<BR>
        I am beginning to feel a tryptamine lift, and the bitter burning<BR>
taste in my throat is subsiding.<BR>
<BR>
9:20PM<BR>
------<BR>
        The taste in my throat has cleared up, and I'm definately feeling<BR>
the effects now. At this point, its still fairly mild, and feels like what<BR>
I would expect from the same ammount done orally. I wonder if it will<BR>
build any more, or if I should do some more? I decide its best to wait<BR>
another 10 minutes or so, just in case.<BR>
<BR>
9:30PM<BR>
------<BR>
        I'm feeling a rather good effect. I seem to have reached a plateau<BR>
now. It feels slightly stronger than this dose would orally - but not by<BR>
much. I feel warm, trippy, and happy. I have very mild visual enhancement<BR>
(bright colors etc), like I would expect from a low oral dose of<BR>
5-MeO-DIPT. The time it took from insufflation to peak effect was roughly<BR>
25-30 minutes. I think a little more will do nicely. 2 lines of 1.5mg each<BR>
are still on the plate, I think one of them is in order - if not both...<BR>
<BR>
9:40PM<BR>
------<BR>
        I insufflate one of the 1.5mg lines.<BR>
<BR>
9:50PM<BR>
------<BR>
        Fuck it. Up with the other 1.5mg!<BR>
<BR>
10:02PM<BR>
-------<BR>
        This route seems to be about co-effective with oral. Same dosage<BR>
range (though maybe insufflated is SLIGHTLY more efficient). Similar<BR>
subjective effects, although this seems a little more energetic, and it<BR>
hit alot faster. The neck tension and jaw clench seems a little less<BR>
prominent. There is no trace of stomach discomfort. This is a very clean<BR>
experience compared to my oral experiments with 5-MeO-DIPT. This is an<BR>
exceedingly comfortable place. This feels like wrapping up in a warm fuzzy<BR>
blanket in front of a fire on a winter night.<BR>
<BR>
10:32PM<BR>
-------<BR>
        Ahhh... very nice. The last few lines are fully kicked in. I am at<BR>
a very solid +2. Warmth, a nice tryptamine body high, a relaxed and mellow<BR>
mindset. Some mild visual enhancements and perhaps even hits of OEVs<BR>
scurrying past the corners of my eyes. I feel like going to lay down and<BR>
relax and think for a while.<BR>
<BR>
11:00PM<BR>
-------<BR>
        Wow. Laying on my couch and listening to my fan was amazing. A<BR>
timeless sense of relaxation and bliss. Thinking contentedly about life.<BR>
Everything is good. I feel very introspective, in a warm fuzzy way. Again,<BR>
the sensation is similar to the coming down phase of a very good LSD trip.<BR>
I do feel that I am lower down now than I was a half hour ago, however. A<BR>
few quick tokes of cannabis, then off to lay down for a few more minutes.<BR>
<BR>
11:11PM<BR>
-------<BR>
        I'm unable to return to that warm, floaty place. I seem to be<BR>
coming down a good deal now. I am still quite high but the mental effects<BR>
are now taking a back seat to the purely physical sensation of<BR>
tryptamineness. The bright colors are still very prominent. But the peak<BR>
effects are beginning to subside. I feel I've still got a long glide down.<BR>
<BR>
11:50PM<BR>
-------<BR>
        I'm a little lower than I was. Its very hard to judge how far you<BR>
have come with this substance. Its very difficult to tell if I'm feeling<BR>
less effect than a half hour ago, or to tell what effects have dissipated.<BR>
But I know that I am alot further towards baseline than I was a half hour<BR>
ago, nevertheless. I did notice a sort of laxative effect just now - an<BR>
increase in peristalsis, rather. Perhaps the stomach effects of oral doses<BR>
are not just because of chemical irritation of the stomach or intestine,<BR>
but also due to some sort of neurological process? Perhaps it is<BR>
interacting with serotonin receptors in the brain stem. Its a non-issue<BR>
though. There was no discomfort whatsoever. This was a far cleaner<BR>
experience than oral... except for the bad tasting drip. I think I will be<BR>
using this route more than the oral route, despite my usual aversion to<BR>
snorting things. Its just a cleaner trip this way.<BR>
<BR>
12:30AM<BR>
-------<BR>
        I'm pretty far down now. Could probably sleep without too much<BR>
effort now. This experiment exceeded my expectations quite a bit.<!-- End Body -->
