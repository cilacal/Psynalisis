Before I start this I would like to say this is something that I will never do again and that taking a 10 strip was nothing compared to this. Whenever I decided to take it I was not fully aware of what I was taking. I had no idea of the difference between acid and research chemicals. <br/>
<br/>
The night started out really calm I sat down and was watching my friend spin poi for me. As the drug started to take effect the poster I was strring at through the light show started to blink and morph. I thought this was amazing and kept giggling. After watching this for what seemed like hours, roughly 20 mins. We decided to go pick up a couple of buddies. As my friend is driving I'm staring at the lights running along the freeway and enjoying the refractors coming off the lights. As we pull up to my buddies house I can see the stars outside of the car and just keep smiling as wave after wave of beauty keeps hitting me. <br/>
<br/>
As we are driving back we stop at a gas station. I walk in and say hello to the cop that is standing inside and head for the ATM. For the next 6 mins I'm at the ATM due to the fact of forgetting my pin number. At this point I'm thinking this clerk totally knows I'm fucked up. Quickly I say whatever to the thought and move on with a smile on my face. <br/>
<br/>
As we arrive at my buddies' house I take a 50mg dab hit. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">As we arrive at my buddies' house I take a 50mg dab hit.</div></div> This was great until my buddy leans over with his phone to show me a video. The video being far away by feed me and kill the noise. As I start to watch my buddy says to me don't be afraid to let your mind go there. As I start to watch the video all of the blue that is in the video is red in my mind. I think this is okay until I start to hear a little kid's voice say, Far away to hell. Take my hand and walk with me.' This is repeated twice before I freak the fuck out. <br/>
<br/>
I'm thinking at this point that my friends are trying to make me give my soul to the devil and that they are all satan worshippers. I tell them that they are sick and I storm out of the house. As I slam the door the thought of I'm just tripping jumps in my head and I calm down a lil and walk back in. As I walk in I grab his phone and look at it. Feed me's character is in the middle of the screen and in the background all I see is fire and upside down floating crosses. I'm just tripping is all I say to my friends and I walk over and sit down on the couch. My friends can see I'm freaked so they give me a stuffed animal monkey puppet to hug to try and calm me down. At this point all phones freak me out, mine included. As I'm sitting there I make all my friends turn their phones away from me or keep them in there pockets. They decided to see if I wanted to go out and watch them spin and glove. I agree and walk out. <br/>
<br/>
As I'm watching my buddy's glove show the lights form into a face and start to talk. I freak out and walk away and just look up at the sky and all the stars. This slightly calms me down and all my friends ask me what I want to do. I tell them I want to go inside and talk about life. As we walk in I sit down and proceed to get lost in my mind for the next two hours. During this time a reoccurring thought of I don't have a soul keeps going through my mind. My friends are talking to me and trying to calm me down but all I hear is the Charlie Brown adults talking. As I finally break out of my head I look around to see that my friends are wanting to go on a walk. I tell them no and they all leave. What I hadn't told them was that I wanted to wait until it was daylight because looking out my buddy's door it was pitch black and I thought the house I was in existed cause I could see it. But since I could see outside it was therefore nonexistent. <br/>
<br/>
As I lay there tripping I start to reflect on my own life and this world we live in. At this point I come to the conclusion life is a miracle and I need to stop doing all this crap and get my life together <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">I come to the conclusion life is a miracle and I need to stop doing all this crap and get my life together</div></div>. I soon fall asleep. As I wake up 3 hours later I go outside and look up...the afternoon sky is multi colored...I am still tripping. The next 14 hours I spend doing what I'm supposed to do that day and getting lost in thought. <br/>
<br/>
All my friends that did this, 6 other people, all had a bad trip ranging from a half hour to three hours once they peaked.<!-- End Body -->
