It started with having to finish a report.  Due the next day, I was wigging out, trying to get it done.  I'd spent the entire Sunday typing away at my computer, but I still was barely halfway done.  This report counted for over half of my Literature grade, I had to get it done.  So, sneaking out of my room that night.  I obtained a third dose of Adderrol.  My doctor had recently upped my dosage to two 20 mg a day.  I was accustomed to taking my perscription for granted, taking 3 sometimes 4 a day.  Tonight was no exception.<br/>
<br/>
So, I popped the pill and sat at my computer.  As I awaited my all-to-lovely rush of energy and ability I thought to myself, 'Why not?'  Went to the livingroom and got two more pills and popped them.  Effectively enough, the pills worked through the night.  I did have a few minor problems.  Being obsessive compulsive and lacking sleep, I found that my computer simply did not match with the way I was sitting.  My neck kept getting stiff, making it even harder to work.  I thought, at the time, the solution surrounded the way my chair was facing.  Periodically throughout the night I twisted the chair into a 45 degree change so that it faced the window.  When my mother woke up the next morning, asking me why I'd done it, I nervously chewed my nail and attempted to explain, 'My computer wouldn't sit right in that position...so I changed it around.  Besides, I think better sitting like that.'  My mother - an ex-methhead - gave me a worried glance, kissed my forehead and told me to get some sleep.<br/>
<br/>
But I found that sleep was my enemy.<br/>
<br/>
As the morning wore on, I was running ragged.  The amphetamines had worn off and with no sleep, I couldn't think.  Distressed that my paper was due that day and I had only until Midnight, I decided more Adderoll was needed, and badly.  I popped the two I usually took, then four more.  I worked rapidly, but I found that my thoughts were less connected even with the upped amount.  The meds caused my brain to tick quickly, but sleep deprivation kept my fingers going slow.  I often found myself staring into space.  At some points I couldn't sit still, often finding myself walking around the house for no reason.  Frustrated with my innattentiveness, I took one more.  <br/>
<br/>
But nothing helped, I began getting paranoid.  Everything made noises and creaked in the house.  I would grab my hair and scream because the noises distracted my thoughts.  There were times I jumped 180 degrees in my chair, peering out as I crouched in anticipation towards my door way because I'd sworn someone had been standing behind me.  To calm myself, I used pot.  Smoking two or three bowls in hour intervals to keep myself from going insane.  I also smoked at least a pack and a half of cigarettes that day.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I finished the report at 10 o'clock that night.  I wasn't tired, due to the amount of amphetamines in my system.  To help me sleep I ended up taking two atarax (25 mg each) and three tramadols (50 mg each).  <br/>
<br/>
After that I quite abusing my Adderoll.  First of all, I need it to concentrate in school, as I actually have ADD.  Second of all, the paranoia was too much for me.  I dislike sleep deprivation immensely, but when you throw in chemicals, that sleep deprivation becomes like a trip and I don't trip well.  I lack the ability to tell the difference between reality and fantasy.<br/>
