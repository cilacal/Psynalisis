Im now 18, male, middle class, normal etc. I have been drinking for about 3/4 years and smoking weed, ecstasy, lsd, poppers. A few months ago I went out with some friends to a club. I was in a relatively good mood and drinking casually ie. not drowning my sorrows/ trying to kill myself. <br>
<br>
I think I had about 7 or 8 double vodkas in the space of about an hour, I felt fine and was running around trying to 'pull'. My memory's pretty hazy but eventually I found myself getting off with a really attractive girl. Suddenly the vodka hit me in a bad way (before this I was feeling drunk but good), I didn't feel like I was going to throw up but I felt out of control, I was stumbling around and sweating etc. All this was fine if a bit unpleasant. I had a few ( I can't remember how many) more drinks with this girl (whose name I forget). <br>
<br>
Suddenly I became incredibly horny and I was basically groping this girl and pulling her towards the toilets trying to convince her to come and have sex in the  toilets with me, problem was I couldn’t speak. Next thing I remember I was on a toilet with the door unlocked with diarrhea and puking over and over in front of me, I think about 5 times. At this point I felt that I was going to die, no that’s wrong, I felt so bad that I wanted to die. I have never felt suffering as extreme as this before and I really think if someone had given me a gun I would have killed myself. I started crying as someone tried to open the door of the cubicle, I tried to tell them there was someone in here but they persisted and eventually got the door open (I didn’t lock it). It turned out the person trying to get in was a security guard. <br>
<br>
He thought I was taking drugs so he demanded that I stand up and empty my pockets. I couldn't and kept crying. He forced me up, with my trousers and pants down and covered in shit/puke and told me to empty my pockets I did so as best I could and all my stuff fell on the floor, he picked up the money and left with it, leaving my in the toilet. I blacked out for about another hour and then my friends carried me back to one of their houses. Later the next day on of my friends told me that the girl I was kissing had asked him to protect her from me.<!-- End Body -->
