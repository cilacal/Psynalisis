January 18th, 2002: The date of this experience.  On this date was the first time I had ever consumed amanita muscaira in any way, shape, or form.  Today, january 19th, is the date of which I write this experience report.<br/>
<br/>
Personal Background: I have never posted a report of any kind with erowid; however, I am a very experienced 'experimentor' (drug-user) with extensive familiarity with such substances as LSD, Ecstasy, Marijuana, Methamphetamines, Salvia, Nitrous, as well as countless pharmaceuticals, and of course, alcohol.<br/>
<br/>
Research: After reading all of the experiences about amanita's I could find, I wasn't too sure if I really wanted to try them or not.  I had obtained a bag of 'grade a' amanita muscaria var. flav. previous to this research.  I obtained them from a reputable online source.  They had been completely sealed off by the source and were between 1-8 months old.  A friend decided he would try them with me if I decided I would.  An opportunity arose and we decided to try them.<br/>
<br/>
Preparation: My friend, we'll call him 'C', and I met at his house with his friend who was our designated 'sitter'.  We crushed the baggie of 30 grams up into shake the best we could.  Even though the shrooms were a little old (1-8 months), they weren't as crisp or hard as I thought they would be; it took quite an effort to break the baggie all up into shake.  I mixed the baggie up real well.  All the stems had become 'powder' and the caps small to large 'chunks' in the baggie.  I weighed out 2 12 gram baggies of mostly the chunks (caps).  Me and a friend poured our baggies into glasses, filled them half-full of root-beer and drank the shrooms/liquid.<br/>
<br/>
T+ 1 hour:<br/>
<br/>
Nothing yet.  I decided to load up a pipe with a few cap chunks to see if we could get the 'trip' going.  Me and a friend each smoked about 1.5 bowls.  We start to feel 'happy' and 'empathetic' (I would compare this feeling very much to ecstasy.  However, both experiences are very different.)  Me and my friend both aggree that we 'feel -really- good'.  We cant help but keep tapping our feet or something and listen to the music.  It sounded good.<br/>
<br/>
T+ 1 hour 15 mins:<br/>
<br/>
We started to noticed things pretty far away to appear kinda blurry/fuzzy.  Not nearly as bad as it would soon get.  We put in 'Office Space' and started to watch it.  Our mouths were salivating slightly as we expected them to.  We still felt very 'good' nonetheless.<br/>
<br/>
T+ 1 hour 30 mins:<br/>
<br/>
Vision is very blurry.  Salivation pretty bad.  Up until this time, I still felt real 'normal' in my head and yet still felt really good.  Now we were starting to feel kinda 'out of it'.  We would space-out quite a bit.  Short term memory was very very much gone.  I couldnt remember anything about the movie.  The TV screen was about 20' big and about 5 feet in front of me, yet everything was very very very blurry - as if I had taken out my contacts.  I tried squinting and it didnt really help much.  Despite it being very blurry, I didn't care.  As I said before, I was kinda 'out of it'.  The empathy kinda went away.  If something was like 2 feet in front of me, it appeared very normal and not blurry at all.  If anything was about 2 inches farther away, it was very fuzzy/blurry.  This 15-20 minutes of time felt like alot longer.  About 30 minutes.  Time distorition was pretty bad.  Probably because our short-term memories were gone.<br/>
<br/>
T+ 1 hour 45 mins:<br/>
<br/>
Same as above except the now-gone 'empathy' was replaced with the feeling of my legs wanting to twitch every 5 or so seconds.  They wouldn't really twitch but maybe every minute, but they felt like they were eveyr 5 seconds.  This game me some discomfort.  At the same time, I would notice I was sweating pretty bad and felt pretty hot.  Because of all this 'twitching' and 'twitch-like feeling', I felt cold at the same time.  From my research, I expected this though.  It's quite an odd feeling.  Mouth was still salivating pretty bad, too.  Things were even more blurry then before.  This would last another hour and a half.<br/>
<br/>
T+ 3 hours 15 mins:<br/>
<br/>
Vision still very fuzzy/blurry.  Salivation went down a little.  Not feeling 'twitchy' anymore but still rather cold despite all the sweating.  I felt as though I came back to being 'sane' upstairs because I felt clear minded once again.  'Spacing out' for the both of us was no longer a permanent thing.  We were pretty much normal in the head and just kinda spaced out for a couple seconds about every 3-5 minutes.  Short term memory was still pretty messed up.  Movie was over despite it seeming to last forever during our viewing.  Now that it was over it seemed like we had only been watching for 15 minutes.  It's one of those 'time goes by slow each moment at a time, but overall fast' type situations.  I compare that to the same time distortion I would get on most other illegal substances.  Before the movie ended, our sitter went into the other room.  Me and 'C' talked for another 15 minutes.  We both felt as though the peak effects of the shrooms had passed.  We both felt a tiny bit of the 'happy' feeling, yet pretty tired, too.  I decided to leave because there wasn't much to do at this house, and I felt pretty hungry too.<br/>
<br/>
T+ 4 hours:<br/>
<br/>
Well I made it home and stopped by a fast food restaurant on the way.  It took about 30 minutes to get home, and it was quite difficult.  I think driving on every drug is dangerous.  Some more than others.  I find that this is one of those more dangerous drugs to drive on.  Time distortion was still very messed up as was my short term memory.  My vision was still not back to 20/20, but I could defintely see it was slowly coming back.  I ate the food with pleasure and comfort.  I eagerly anticipated laying down in bed under the covers and relaxing.  I was still feeling quite happy though very tired by now.  Physically I was kinda worn out.  Mentally I was just drained.  The shrooms were trying to continue the 'trip' but I was ready for bed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span><br/>
<br/>
T+ 4 hours 20 mins:<br/>
<br/>
Fell asleep quite easilly. (It was midnight at this time)<br/>
<br/>
The Aftermath: I woke up 8 hours later, at 8am; I had to be at work at 9:30.  I was very tired as usual when waking up so early.  No 'hangover' at all from these mushrooms.  I felt relatively nice this morning and felt pretty positive.  As I am typing this, I am quite shocked that I don't recall any dreams last night.  This is very unusual.  I usually dream quite a bit every night and recall it in the morning.  I suppose I got some pretty deep sleep last night.<br/>
<br/>
24 hours ago to this moment, I was just entering the powerful world of amanita muscaria and was experiencing it to possibly it's highest potential.  I will never forget it, though never repeat it (please note: this is not because I did not enjoy it.  Overall, I can't say I regret it at all).<!-- End Body -->
