<!-- Start Body -->
Male, 180 lbs, no current benzo tolerance before this but occasionally I occasionally take 2-5mg of alprazolam and remember most of the night. I have also tried flunitrazepam, diazepam and clonazepam and have good times with these substances.<br/>
<br/>
So on Monday (3 days ago) I was excited to see I'd gotten my 10ml bottle 1mg/ml flubromazolam liquid and 90 count tablets of clonazolam (.5-.7mg each).<br/>
<br/>
Started with one tablet, took another 25 minutes later and that's when things got blurry. I remember ingesting maybe .5ml of the flubromazolam liquid after that as well (using a .25ml segmented pipette). So a total of 1mg clonazolam and .5mg flubromazolam (ASKING FOR TROUBLE, I KNOW).<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I wake up the next day about 26 hours later to find the flubromazolam liquid completely empty. I believe I spilled it because if 9.5mg if flubromazolam was actually ingested I believe I would have still been asleep or much less coherent.<br/>
<br/>
Anyways, because of my lowered inhibitions I start popping the tablets like candy. I gave some to friends, maybe a total of 20 but even that's a maximum overstatement. Between tuesday and wednesday I either dropped on the floor, or consumed over 75 pellets of clonazolam.<br/>
<br/>
During one of the nights, my step dad found me on the kitchen floor, covered in bed sheets with a big mess everywhere including food all over the ground.<br/>
<br/>
Using my longboard as transportation, my friends mom who owns a coffee/ice cream shop said I stopped by and was outside the shop eating a latte, ice cream, texting and longboarding at the same time looking super fucked up. She said a car almost hit me and had to slam on the brakes.<br/>
<br/>
I do vaguely remember recall a car honking at me very closely and I'm lucky I'm still alive. That was a 45mph road.<br/>
<br/>
I also vaguely remember breaking a bunch of glass, stepping on it and leaving blood stains all over the floor where I was stepping around in my room (I had absolutely no pain so I didn't give a fuck at the time). I cleaned a lot of broken glass and blood off of the carpet yesterday.<br/>
<br/>
I woke up today without a longboard, went out looking for it for a while and gave up. I had just bought this longboard two weeks ago for $190 and just got new bearings for it in the mail today. So yeah that's gone.<br/>
<br/>
One of my friends I gave 1 tablet too blacked out for the entire day and missed his date with his girlfriend.<br/>
<br/>
I wouldn't recommend these benzos to anyone unless you already have like a 12mg a day alprazolam habit or something crazy like that (I'm serious, no exaggeration). These will fuck up your life.<!-- End Body -->
