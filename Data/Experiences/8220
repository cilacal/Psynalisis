The reason that I write this report is so that people may benefit from my experience with these two chemicals and extoll the virtues of the mushroom AMT combination.  I had tried AMT several times before; I found it long lasting, but not overly satisfying.  A psychedelic veteran will likely not find the AMT experience thrilling except at high, nausea inducing dosages, but again, everyone is different.  Naturally then, I sought to augment the reality twisting aspects of the experience by boosting with a more profound psychedelic, mushrooms.  The dose that I took was a fairly medium dose, nothing overly large, shrooms vary widely in their potency, so saying a 'medium dose' I believe to be much more useful than saying 'two grams' if you know your shrooms.  <br/>
<br/>
The first time that I attempted this experiment, I'd been rolling on AMT for most of the morning, and, like before, sought just a little more oomph.  Perhaps a few good tokes of salvia may have put me in the right spot, and eager psyconauts should try this out, but alas, I had none of the herb on hand.  So I turned to some shrooms.  I ingested a medium dose and awaited the effects.  Except for a mild mood elevation, nothing happened and the AMT rode its course as usual.  The next time that I tried this combination, however, I took a dose of shrooms FIRST, let it take effect, and then T +2 hrs or so (T +1 hr may better if like AMT or E) took the AMT and what a difference!   It would seem that AMT, although not as effective psychologically, creates a much greateer biological tolerance to your generic tryptamine, and taking shrooms after ingesting it has little effect. You can take them at the same time, I tried this too, but stick with the 'Shrooms first' mantra, it's better.)  <br/>
<br/>
The trip was VIBRANT to say the least, very euphoric as well (and, of course, it lasts for 14 hrs).  The combination worked quite well and the physicality of the AMT synergized with the spirituality of the shooms to produce a well balanced, lucid trip.  I would recommend the experience to everyone, especially those who want to get a little more distance out of a mushroom trip instead of the meager four hours.  It's not as INTENSE as acid mentally, but the visuals are fine and you'll feel great.  The thing to remember with this experiment is, again, the fact that the AMT is biologically more powerful, meaning that it will dominate the experience, say, if you took a small dose of shrooms and a medium dose of AMT.  BUT, if you take a large dose of shrooms and a medium or so dose of AMT, now there's a good time.  <br/>
<br/>
Here are a few notes of importance I discovered along the way:  <br/>
<br/>
<OL><br/>
<LI>Hide your pot, you'll want to smoke it, and smoke it and smoke it, due to the edge of the AMT and the fact it last all day (strange, since tripping on anything else I don't care), but unless you're riding low level, it will have no effect.</LI>  <br/>
<LI>Take AMT in the morning.  Unless you enjoy feeling like you're tweaking on some dirty crank at four in the morning, please anticipate the duration of this drug and the effect that it has on your body.  </LI><br/>
<LI>Make sure your experiemental chemicals are clean.  If you're like most people and get them through chemical supply houses, note that on the outside of the bottle it says, 'Not for drug use.'  Of course, this doesn't mean that the sample is less pure, but it does mean that the impurities in it don't necessarily have to be benign.  The AMT I acquired, for instance, had a very large amount of organic solvent still left in it.  Dissolving it in hot water boiled off the diethyl ether that was present in mine and made it MUCH more pleasant to ingest.</LI><br/>
<br/>
