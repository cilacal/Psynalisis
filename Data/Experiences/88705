<!-- Start Body -->
It was an experience I had several months ago but is still impacts my life every day. It was a very intense experience. I suppose I should explain why I ate such a large amount in the first place. I was heavily into shamanism and psychedelics at the time when I had this particular trip. I was a very experienced psychonaut as many of my friends were. <br/>
<br/>
The dose initially was supposed to be a 15 mg 2C-E trip with the brownie and hydroponic mushroom. When I took the first pill of ten, the onset and first plateau were amazing as always. Feeling emotions that make heroin or cocaine look like a joke. Literally the way my body felt as if I had died and was in a spirit body. But halfway through the trip I started to hear a voice. This voice was a source of some kind of alien knowledge that is so powerful and knew everything I was thinking could think or had thought of. <br/>
<br/>
The voice then encouraged me to eat more 2C-E because it's not the drug that causes the trip, but the gods, or God that causes it. I thought as though the pills were empty and God was showing me things. Such things as when I was breaking up marijuana to smoke the marijuana bits on the table turned into little green soldiers shooting each other. Not hazy at all they had arms legs and distinct features. Then when in a yoga position the wall by the tv faded completely away into nothingness and alien beings resided on the other side. Communication about poverty disease and war, and how they want to help us rid our planet of it. <br/>
<br/>
I assume these aliens are all representations of spirits from the spirit world. I assumed the voice was God because a voice would tell me it was and then would amaze me with magic in front of my own eyes. The kinds of matter manipulating and physics defying things the voice showed me were to far out to not believe. I was totally convinced that these pills were a front for interaction with the spirit realm. So as I downed another 9 pills (for proof that it was all the spirits not the drug) I was totally convinced that there was no drug or substance that can break time and space. I was and still am to this day a die hard believer that there is no drug in these magic entheogens and tryptamines, but it is a spirit that lives inside of these plants. <br/>
<br/>
Other hallucinations include seeing the chakras glowing on my body, faces in books or magazines or movie covers winking at me or talking directly too me. I must say that these hallucinations were far too real for me too believe that a drug can cause this. I know for a fact that there are others out there that have experienced the great heights such as these and would agree that this drug will always remain a great and powerful mystery.<!-- End Body -->
