I had heard about AMT from my friends, and it sounded great: 12-14 hours of tripping. I had tripped on LSD and Mushrooms, and both were extremely fun, so I thought an extended version would be even better. So I got a hold of some powder, and put into a pill capsule and swallowed it at 4:00 pm. I had heard it hurt on an empty stomach, so I ate some food before hand. <br>
<br>
My parents were out for the night so I decided to have a party in our pole shed. (It's big). Well I was talking with my friends and about 4:30 I got the worst stomachache of my life. I ran to my house and went into the bathroom. I started to turn pale, get cold, and sweat. I sat on the toilet clutching a garbage can for about 20 minutes, and then it went away.<br>
<br>
At about 5pm it started to kick in. I felt like knew everything. I felt connected to everything and everyone. Everything everyone said was important to me and significant. If I found out something new about someone, it felt like my whole life changed. It was great. I started to see visuals at about 8pm. I would stare at the floor and colored lines started to twist and tangle together, things grew and shrank, I saw the sunrise and set... Awesome. Then it got weird.<br>
<br>
Time started to go by SOO slow. I thought I had been tripping for 6 hours, but it was only 9pm. My stomach started to hurt again, so I sat down. Then I thought I was a computer. I was a computer that was supposed to sort and file people away by their personality types. I'd look at a person and assign a type to them, file it, then on to the next. This went on until about 11:30 pm. Then I looked at one of my friends and he was holding a steel bar. I thought he was going to come kill me. I started to run away whenever he came near me... Then he and another one of my friends started slap boxing, and I punched him in the stomach. I thought he was trying to kill my other friend. Then I realized what had happened. He took it really well, and we laughed it off. But after that no one could touch me or I'd start to freak out... So I thought it would be best to sit in a chair in the corner and stare at the floor.<br>
<br>
At about 1am, this guy I kinda know who does a lot of drugs stopped by with some nugs and some crack. I thought now would be as good as time as any to smoke some chronic... Bad idea. My vision started to fade in and out, in and out. This went on until about 2am, when I went to my house for some reason. I got in my house and went into my room and stared at the Jack Skellington dolls I had for about 5 minutes. Then went back down to the pole shed. All the way having a feeling that someone was following me...<br>
<br>
At 2:30am one of my friends hot sisters came over. She and I said that we would trip together soon. So she came and sat down next to me, looked at me and said, 'We're not tripping together.' This is when the AMT hit me with all it had. The words tripping echoed in my head and I felt them being branded onto my brain. Fat Pink and white wavy lines came out behind the girl like rays from the sun. Mushrooms started to flow out from her into the lines, and it was all I could see, and all I could hear was 'Tripping.' Then I blinked and it stopped. I tried mingling with people, but when I spoke I didn't make any sense to anyone but myself. So again I sat in the corner.<br>
<br>
At 3:30 everyone but a few close friends left and we went to go pass out. I was uber tired. They all passed out. And I couldn't sleep cause my mind was racing with a million and one thoughts, so put on some music. I started with some techno. It made me feel SO euphoric and happy. Then Diesel Boy came on. This wave of fear swept over me and I felt very paranoid. I looked around my darkened room, and saw Jack Skellington trying to hide from me... That was the end of the techno.<br>
<br>
At about 4:30 I turned off the techno and turned on some Thursday. The fear and paranoia was washed away as the melodic tunes of, 'This Side of Brightness' came on. I felt warm. Then as I began to sing along to the lyrics I realized how depressing it was. I began to become depressed and sad, I felt like crying. Then it became worse and I felt like life was pointless, might as well end it now. I turned off the music and turned on the TV.<br>
<br>
5:00am, my 12th hour of tripping, Hook was on. (Great movie) I watched, but had to keep reminding myself that It wasn't real, it was a movie. I had to remind myself that Neverland Didn't exist, people can't fly, and fairies weren't real. The movie ended at 6:45 and I was ready to finally fall asleep. Oh no, my brain had better things to do that sleep.<br>
<br>
At 7:00 I was still awake, talking to myself for the past 15 minutes, then music started playing in my head. Except it was a blur of all of the songs I had listened to at once. A powerful rush of emotions came over me: euphoria, compassion, fear, love, hate, depression, anger. I didn't know how to handle it. I thought if this lasted any longer I was going to go crazy. <br>
<br>
After about 10 minutes of that, the songs were replaced my conversation. People at the party were all talking to me. They'd talk then their voice would fade away and be replaced another, and another, and another. I thought I had lost my mind at this point. The voices were soon accompanied by closed eye visuals. Snakes, spiders, the ocean, a tropic beach, Final Fantasy X... You name it.<br>
<br>
At 8am, the voices started to fade. The visuals continued. Now that the voices were gone I could finally sleep. WRONG. I couldn't get comfortable in my usually ultra-comfy bed. Everywhere I moved it felt like I was laying on a rock. I struggled with this for another hour. The visual went on until I finally fell asleep. Can't say for sure when, but it was around 11:23 (last I looked at the clock)<br>
<br>
I woke up the next afternoon at about 4:30, didn't even hear my friends leave. I felt like shit and looked like hell. Luckily my parents weren't coming back until 6, so I had some time to just sit. My head was foggy and clouded. I felt very worn. Huge headache. Couldn't think well at all. Forgot what I was doing while in the middle of something. But I guess it can be expected after 18 of the craziest hours of my life. <br>
<br>
I don't ever regret doing it. It was an unforgettable experience. I wouldn't recommend it for 1st time trippers.<!-- End Body -->
