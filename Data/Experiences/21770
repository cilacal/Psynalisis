A friend of mine was prescribed to Adderall at the beginning of the second semester of the 2001 school year.  I had graduated HS and have had a great summer thus far, its August and my friend Robert is having an end of year bash at his house.  <br>
<br>
I hadn't done many drugs before this night, mainly just drank, smoked alot of pot, and dabbled in Opium a few times.  I had heard how great this pill makes you feel when you snort it so I decided to give it a try, why not, it is the last party of the summer.<br>
<br>
So I had been drinking for about an hour maybe only 2 or 3 beers when my friend showed up with a full prescription bottle of the '30s'  I bought 3 from him for like 4 bucks.  I bumped one right off the bat and within 10 minutes I felt a high like I have never felt before.  I tend to be a rather mellow person in nature but I had boundless energy and it felt like my mind was running at 200%.  Before taking them he told me that snorting usually takes a lot less time to wear off then simply ingesting them.  So me and another friend split my next two and, wow.  My heart was racing and just about every sense was on fire.  Music was absolutely beautiful to me all the lights in the room were far 'sparklier', and I wanted to have a conversation with just about everything that had 4 limbs.<br>
<br>
Then I decided to chill out and go outside because the house was becoming very hot.  If that was a product of the pills or just the 40 some-odd kids that were there I do not know.  So a handful of us all sat down on the benches in Rob's backyard and smoked a blunt.  I remeber quite vividly just sitting back and staring at the sky between hitting the blunt the stars were very fascinating but I became aware of how hard it became to concentrate on one train of thought, kind of like mushrooms but with less disassociation.<br>
<br>
So I went back inside while all the while thinking of how goddamn great this drug is, I took a piss and DAMN!  My pupils were humongous, nearly engulfing the entire iris, but at least the intense heart pounding had lessened quite a bit.<br>
<br>
In my abscence the Beruit table (beer pong) had been set up and I was set to play in about an hour.  'An hour?' I thought.  Well I better buy some more Addys and sniff a few more lines so I am nice and ready for the game.  A few lines turned into an all-out bakeoff of snorting pills.  Since my mind was fairly sharp even when intensely messed up I estimate I had roughly 2 more pills worth of lines (maybe a bit more).<br>
<br>
I step up to play Beruit and its almost as if only the table is the room, illuminated by abnormally bright and, again, sparkly lights.  I would shoot the ball and 9 times out of ten it went in, I could feel my skill almost flow down from my eyes to brain to arm.  The ball would leave an afterimage 'tail' of some sort behind it that was a warmer color than the stark white ball, like a trail leading directly to my great shot.  I won about 6 games, which turned out to be around 6 more beers.<br>
<br>
I sit down on the couch and the world is rushing through my head.  Not room spinning like alchohol or dissorientation like shrooms, just as if my brain could finally handle all the outside info it was getting, and it was doing a pretty damn good job of it.  So too reward myself I took out the next pill and to save my nose some grief I just swallowed it.<br>
<br>
Subsequently I was moving into my new dorm room the following evening and before I could even notice I had the next week planned out.  Not like generalizations or anything, but even lunches and naps were included.  Weird since I am so very unorginized and rarely plan father than a few hours in advance of my life.  When I came to this realization of what I had been doing all I felt was my heart beating.  Now I've played full games of Varsity soccer before, I've been scared for my life, but this was a heart beating like I have never felt, no pain, no tingling, just hard intense beating at the fastest anyone could have had sitting on their ass planning a week out.<br>
<br>
I didn't really freak out but I moved fast to the bathroom to get some water since my mouth was a veritable Sahara Desert.  I looked in the mirror an my iris' were no longer viewable.  I got right up close to the mirror to see if I could actually see my iris and got transfixed on the sparkling little spots of light on my pupil.  The rest of the room darkened considerable and all I could do was focus on these little points of beautiful light.  This was not scary at all, but entirely the opposite I was almost overjoyed to be experiencing such things.<br>
<br>
The rest of the night was uneventful, other than talking to just about everyone at the party for upwards of 45 minutes at a time.  They were all drunk so they enjoyed my over-enthusiasm.  I went back home at around 6AM and as I was heading back the sun was rising, I was certainly under the influence of the drugs, but it was a more calm and retrospective feeling about the evening.<br>
<br>
I got home, took a shower (which felt great), and lay down for some sleep in my bed.  As I soon found out sleep was the most impossible thing to attempt at the time.  My heart was still pounding, and every 10 seconds or so I would involutarily open my eyes and then curse myself for not just keeping them shut and falling asleep.  When I could manage to keep my eyes shut all I could focus on was the strong and fast beating of my heart, which was as annoying and diruptfull as blaring music at 6:30AM.  Even when I did finally concentrate and slow my heartbeat to acceptable levels anything would set it racing again.  That consisted of wind, pipes popping, creaking, even the sound of my hair on the pillow.  Also any sort of thought that related to the future and my starting college career would set it racing again.<br>
<br>
I didn't sleep at all, I was awake when my dad yelled down to me it was time to get up and get moved into my dorm.  Moving in was interesting to say the least, I felt like a zombie but I had to act like I was fine and great.  My parents have no problem with booze or pot, but if they found out I snorted 5 misc. pills that were basically speed they would have killed me.  The entire next day I just moped around and tried to nap, with the same results as before.  It might have been around 4AM when I finally fell asleep in an utter delirious tired state.  <br>
<br>
The next day I felt fine, I was a little worn out but that can be expected.  My heartbeat didn't return to normal for a few more days but it stayed at acceptable levels.<br>
<br>
I have done Addys a dozen or so times after that but recently stopped due to tolerance to the drug, it almost wears off immediately and just leaves me with the ability to not sleep due to my heart pounding.<br>
<br>
Thanks for reading!<br>
