I am an experienced psychonaut and have been around the block a few times.  However, I had never tried any of the 'harder' drugs before, so I thought a good introduction would be speed.  I bought $20 of speed from my friend who has been a speed addict for 2 years, so I'm fairly sure it was some form of amphetamine.  Another friend and I each took half of the $20.  I don't know what the actual weight in grams was of our dosage, as I don't have a scale that can accurately measure in small increments.<BR>
<BR>
Several years ago I had an operation on my nose (they used cocaine, ;-) lol) because I have frequent bloody noses.  I didn't want to aggravate my nose, so I decided to ingest the speed instead.  My friend snorted her dose.<BR>
<BR>
Noticable effects started for me approximately 40 minutes after ingestion.  I felt really light and floaty and extremely happy.  The body load was pretty light, but I was talking non-stop, just jabbering about nothing in particular as long as I was moving my mouth.  My jaw started clenching like it does on E, so I chewed gum pretty much the whole night.<BR>
<BR>
We went to my friends apartment where there were approximately 20 people in the process of getting drunk.  We got along great with them--we were all dancing to the music and laughing (although they did not know we were on speed).  I felt really happy and talkative and slightly energetic, though not at all tweaky.  Soft warm rushes tingled all through my body and when I sat down I felt like I was floating.<BR>
<BR>
I basically stayed at that same level for the next 5 hours.  It never really increased past the social lubricant stage.  I was slightly disappointed because my friend was having a great time the whole night--very euphoric and happy, obviously on a level higher than me.  <BR>
<BR>
The night went on, and I came down slightly--I wasn't quite so happy, but I was still all tingly and talkative.  The mild warm rushes continued for a long while after my friend came down though--I was still feeling them 17 hours after ingestion.  <BR>
<BR>
I had horrible insomnia that night (which I expected)--I couldn't go to sleep until 5 hours after everyone else.  I had mass jaw clenching (which I also expected), but I didn't notice elevated heart rate or breathing, increased aggressiveness (I was very passive), nor increased concentration.  Also, I was very surprised to note that neither my nor my friend's pupils were dialated.<BR>
<BR>
I am very aware of the addictive qualities of speed, so before the experience I totally psyched myself out, saying, 'No matter how great this is, no matter how much you love it, I don't care how good you feel, you are NEVER going to do speed again!'  Well, all this turned out to be pretty pointless because I did not notice any addictive qualities whatsoever.  There was no urge to repeat the experience, and no negative comedown effects.  I do not have an addictive personality, so I am seriously considering repeating the experience in a few weeks.<BR>
<BR>
I am aware that this was a threshold amphetamine experience, and am considering taking a higher dosage (the whole twenty) next time.  I'm sure I'll be awake for 2 days straight, but I think it will be worth it.  This experience was relatively unimpressive and really just a lot of fun.<BR>
<BR>
In conclusion I would like to note the differences of our experiences, snorting versus ingestion.  The intra-nasal administration hit MUCH faster, was more intense, and did not last as long.  Ingestion resulted in a very slow, gradual come-on, mild effects, but was extremely long lasting.<!-- End Body -->
