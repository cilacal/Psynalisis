     Ever see Field of Dreams?  The moment when the ghost players return to whatever dimension they came from through the corn...thats how i describe how it feels to immerse yourself in the world of DMT and 5 MEO DMT...This particular journey was my first 5 meo but i have many DMT flyer miles so i felt prepared and relatively at ease.  The delivery system I am accustomed to is a crude mini-liqour bottle with steel wool in the neck...not too fancy.  This delivery was to be my first vaporized.  It was incredible.   The substance was inhaled through a stack style digital vaporizer w/ whip...damn near like delivering anesthetic to yourself.  And none of the horrible rotten tooth aftertaste of smoked DMT.<br>
<br>
     It creeps on me so slowly and easily...like a sheet sliding off of a bed, to reveal a world like no other my eyes had ever seen.  So rich in detail and full of texture, dimension, energy, life, dynamic writhing landscapes with kaleidoscopic ribbons of geometric patterns manifesting throughout...it seemed to stretch on infinitely...<br>
    <br>
      Internally at this time all i can utter is a hardly audible...oh...my...god....The beauty is indescribable, beauty surrounded by warmth and flesh, literally a living world...one that i can recall thanking my friend for inviting me into during the trip...<br>
<br>
     As the journey continued to unfold it felt like i was on Willy Wonka's Paddleboat...drifting toward some central point too blurred to make any sense to me at the time...a few images manifested that i recall...<br>
<br>
     In the distance a shape began to take form...jagged,  lifeless, rotting and slowly approaching my perspective was what appeared to be a massive black iceberg...but...as it neared i realized i was looking at a revolving 3 dimensional representation of the partial wisdom tooth i am anxious to have removed.  There, directly in my closed eyes, hovered the future for my still healthy tooth...i shuddered the image away.<br>
<br>
      The paddleboat continued throught the rich alien landscapes i previously described until...again in the distance, a form began to take place.  This one contained different but similarly attractive energy...i had,again, no fear of this manifestation only a sincere curiosity as if at the zoo or some other exotic menagerie.<br>
<br>
      Now it was apparent...a miniature Demon of some sort was cracking from the focal point a whip that had a Bi-forcated end...a REALLY long whip that looked like garden hose when you snap it...waves and rolls of the whip kept writhing toward my position...literally the tip was tickling my nose...the way a snake would inspect an obstacle in its way...<br>
<br>
      This all soon gave way to a strong urge to profess my emotional ties to the friends in the room...an Emotion that is not apparent on DMT alone...this was more like plugging into the emotional conscious collective...yet at no time did i have any sense of a primitive idea like fear...it literally felt like stepping off a thrilling rollercoaster with a friend, looking back on what you had conquered together and erupting in your personal stories and jubilations.   <br>
<br>
      The question remains...How does it? Unlock that?<!-- End Body -->
