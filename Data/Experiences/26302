It was a nice summer day out in July and my dad had just left for a few day vacation.  I called up my buddy, who i will call Abe, to see if he wanted to come over and smoke a bowl.  He said he would be right over.<BR>
<BR>
I was in a great mood, my dad was gone, pot was about to be smoked; times were good.  I was not on amy medication whatsoever and was in good health on this particular day.  I cleaned my room up real quick then Abe arrived.  When we were preparing the bowls, he pulled out a little orange medicine jar with some white, sticky, dust in it. He told me it was called DMT and offered me a hit.<BR>
<BR>
Always interested in new, safe, drugs, i asked him a little about it.  He had only experimented a little with it before this and he basically told me the duration and not to be afraid after I hit it because it is not dangerous.  i trust him and i accepted his offer.  <BR>
<BR>
He sprinkled enough DMT to cover all of the pot in the bowl, and advised me to take the hit sitting down (which was a very good suggestion.)  I sat on the edge of my bed, not really fearing the drug, thinking, 'here goes nothing' and inhaled the whole hit, which melted suprisingly fast.  <BR>
<BR>
I held the hit in for a good amount of time, then i exhaled.  It was then that i was suddenly blasted with an intense anxiety, immediately saying 'I dont like this!'  My lungs tightened up and I was forced to take shallow breaths.  I heard and felt a buzzing get more and more intense and I fell back on my bed repeating, 'holy shit, holy shit, holy shit.  Whats happening?!'  <BR>
<BR>
I looked at Abe and realized he couldn't really help me now and i began to panic.  I blacked out but was still awake because I recall screaming in what i thought was pain, 'Im in hell, Im dying!' at the top of my lungs.  I was convinced i was dying, there was no doubt in my mind at all that this was the very end of my life. I began to notice what I thought was the systematic shutting down of all my bodily functions, all the while in complete dark screaming and not having any idea what had occured before this.  There are no words I have found that can describe the terror I experianced.  As I held what I though was my final breath I accepted 'death' and was at peace.<BR>
<BR>
I was in awe at the horror that had just passed through me, but i was tripping to hard to think anything about it. Completely calm and collected, i laid down on my carpet and enjoyed a pretty amazing trip for about 20-30 minutes.  Witnessing sparks of light which i referred to as 'insects' jumping from the tips of my hairs to the carpet and back was the highlight, while the ambient music was generally enhanced.  <BR>
<BR>
Advice i can give to anyone taking any drug, especially DMT, know what you are in for.  I think if I had known that the immediate onset and some of the other effects of the drug, i would not have lost my head.  Even after experiancing the scariest moment of my life, I dont think that DMT is a bad drug, I just cannot stress the importance of being aware and being prepared.<!-- End Body -->
