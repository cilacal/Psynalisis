Recently a new and exotic tryptamine crossed my path. A delightful little substance from TIKHAL called 5-MeO-DIPT appeared to me in the form of two capsules, one containing roughly 10 mg and the other containing around 7 mg. The substance was an off white color, in fairly large chunks rather than a fine crystalline substance. After reading all I could find about it (a few entries in TIKHAL and a few trip reports from the net) I was ready and eager to explore its possibilities. <BR>
<BR>
My girlfriend L and I took the capsules around 11:30 p.m. one night. She took the smaller dose. We went outside to enjoy the night air and await the effects. I hadn't eaten anything since lunch that day to avoid any unpleasant gastrointestinal effects. <BR>
<BR>
Twenty minutes later L asked if I were feeling anything. I told her I was not. She indicated she might be feeling something. I mentioned that many tryptamines first manifest themselves as a tightness in my temples, and she said that was almost exactly what she was feeling. After a few more minutes we went inside, since the bugs were becoming unbearable. <BR>
<BR>
Inside I began feeling the first hints that something was happening. At first it was just a very vague awareness that I was slightly off baseline. Nothing definite, just a slight sense of alteration. L started to have a lot of jaw clench, similar to what she experiences on MDMA and retrieved a pacifier to chew on. She indicated she was starting to feel it strongly. <BR>
<BR>
Ten minutes later it began coming on more strongly for me as well. There was a mild sense of euphoria, similar to a lesser version of the MDMA 'rush', perhaps more like 2CB as it comes on. I felt really good and I began to smile as I so often do as the effects of a drug come on and I begin to anticipate another interesting peek into the depths of my consciousness. <BR>
<BR>
During the time it was coming on, L got up to urinate several times. It seemed to increase her need to use the bathroom, which I found vaguely amusing. We started kissing and touching each other, but were forced to stop when she had to urinate yet again. When she returned she was wearing only her underwear and a tank top. She smiled a wicked smile and walked toward me. <BR>
<BR>
She pushed me to the floor and almost literally tore my shirt off. We began kissing with a great deal of passion, caressing each other as we did so. It felt quite incredible. My tactile sense was turned up a notch or two and I was getting some visuals that seemed triggered by our kissing and touches. I was very, very into what we were doing. <BR>
<BR>
L started playing with my penis. It felt good, but also very strange. It was almost as if it were somehow removed from me, or as if my mind wasn't quite synching up with the sensations that it was receiving. When I started playing with her vagina, she mentioned the same thing. It felt good, but a little odd. We were almost mad with lust, so foreplay, weird or not, didn't last long before we began having sex. <BR>
<BR>
The sex was phenomenally good. It also felt a little weird, but in a very, very good way, the way it feels a little weird the first few times you do it, because it feels so good you just can't quite wrap your mind around it. We were moving together, both completely oblivious to anything but what we were doing. The visual aspect of the trip was steadily increasing, and as we had sex I was seeing abstract patterns form on and around L. We had sex for a fairly long time (maybe twenty minutes) and reached orgasm simultaneously. Orgasm was accompanied by a huge explosion of colorful visuals, momentarily obscuring everything else. <BR>
<BR>
Afterwards we sat there, amazed at what had just occurred. We generally have an excellent sex life, and have enjoyed many sexual experiences enhanced by various psychedelics, but this blew everything else away. It was some of the best sex we had ever had together. We talked about it for a few minutes, then decided to take a shower together to clean ourselves up. <BR>
<BR>
The shower felt great on my body, like a thousand tiny fingers giving me an all over sensual massage. L and I both luxuriated in the warm spray as we washed each other. We talked about the drug and we both agreed it was a hit in our book. We were both still quite high and enjoying the trip. The visuals triggered by my orgasm seemed to have lingered to some degree, as the light and shadows in the bathroom seemed to occasionally bloom into trails and patterns at the edge of my vision. We finished up and I dried off and went into the living room to wait for L to do her post shower rituals. <BR>
<BR>
In the living room I enjoyed the vague swirling visuals in the dim light. I was pleasantly high, a nice low level psychedelic buzz with an all over sense of well being. I started thinking about our earlier sex and soon became very aroused again. I went into the bathroom and began caressing L and soon we were back in the living room, at it again. <BR>
<BR>
The second time wasn't as urgent. We spent more time fooling around, caressing and kissing each other. I brought her to orgasm orally before we had sex. When we did have sex it was just as intense and I was easily able to reach orgasm. I think it took even less time than the first time. <BR>
<BR>
After our second bout we sat around talking. We went back outside to enjoy the beautiful night once again. We were talking about us and how good things were between us. I felt some of the emotional intimacy and openness I associate with MDMA. Everything felt right with the world in general and us in particular. It felt terrific just to be alive. I thanked L for sharing this experience with me, she thanked me for sharing it with her. It was very sappy, but it felt wonderful. I felt incredibly close to her.<BR>
<BR>
We were able to talk about a few touchy subjects with ease and clarity. I think this could be a terrific tool for couples to use to work out differences (or sexual difficulties). <BR>
<BR>
As the drug began to wear off I felt tired. It had been a long day. The come down reminded more than anything of being stoned! I honestly felt like I had smoked some weed. It wasn't an identical feeling, but very reminiscent of good cannabis. A nice bonus! <BR>
<BR>
We went for a walk, stopping at a convenience store for a Slurpee. Afterwards we walked to a park where we sat and talked and discussed our relationship, our future and other intimate things. The feeling of closeness and intimacy was still there in abundance, although most of the other effects had worn off. I was quite tired at this point so we went home and went to bed. <BR>
<BR>
L dropped off almost immediately, but I was unable to sleep. I got up and used the bathroom and read for a half hour or so before finally falling asleep. I awoke after only five hours or so of sleep, but felt really good. Considering how little sleep I'd had I felt terrific. I had an active day and slept wonderfully the next night. <BR>
<BR>
This drug is a winner. If it ever becomes widely available I predict it will be very popular. It seems to have some wonderful aphrodisiac and emotionally opening qualities. This is a potent combination! Many of the people online have been calling this drug 'Foxy Methoxy' or just 'Foxy'. That's a pretty good name, but to me it seemed to be the 'Shagadelic'. I sincerely hope that I get a chance to try it again in the future.<!-- End Body -->
