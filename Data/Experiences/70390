A dark brown viscous liquid arrived with its Proprietor.  A shipibo native, curandero in training. His grandfather is teaching him the ways of the tribe.  He came, having just arrived from Pucallpa, to my friend's apartment in Lima, beckoned by his sister whom I had met a week previously.  I had not yet communed with ayahuasa and was excited and slightly apprehensive for this journey.  <br/>
<br/>
I had become sick with a cold two days previously and still had some bad chest congestion but this was the only chance so I couldn't pass it up.  R seemed trustworthy and we soon prepared for the ingestion.  There were five of us: curandero R, his sister J, the apartment owner RL, my partner KT, and I.  Finally the moment I had long been waiting for. We turned off all the lights but one, in another room, so it was mostly dark.  We cleansed with tobacco and holy wood and began.  <br/>
<br/>
My ceremonial intention was to have better understanding of spiritual communication.  The liquid was very sour and tart, stripping the mucous membranes in my mouth and throat.  I sat, slightly nervous and anxious.  R began to sing, soothing my mind. I laid down on my back. Waves on uneasiness broke through me and I had to sit up. I needed to purge.  I vomited into a bucket that had no bottom, but an endless void.  I was the fourth to vomit and it wasn't much for volume but I felt as if every cell in my body was vomiting at the same time.  When I was through and feeling a little better and clearer I laid back down in the fetal position.  <br/>
<br/>
I had my eyes closed.  I started seeing distant, vague swirling colors. which soon surrounded me and became very sharp and pixellated. I could see the hoographic matrix we are in.  I felt a presence moving toward me from behind. A moment of paranoia sprang up in my mind and I thought the presence said ' I am going to torture you!'  At that moment R, still singing, directed a specific note toward me.  I saw it leave his mouth (with my eyes still closed and not facing him) and pass over me, changing the dissonant vibration of my paranoia into a more harmonic structure.  I then saw the presence as an energetic, biosonic jellyfish, hovering above me.  It reminded me of the sentinels in 'The Matrix' It was translucent pastel pinks, purples, and blues.  Its bell shaped structure was completely made of interlocking eyes, similar to an Alex Grey painting but they were in a constant shiting motion.  <br/>
<br/>
It  reached out and passed one of its tentacles over me.  It seemed to be scanning me and the end of the tentacle was a sort of organic machine device.  After it was done scanning me it said 'Lie flat on your back or sit up.'  I sat up and the image of the cover art of the album Undertow by Tool came to my mind as the jellyfish sort of morphed into that shape. I felt as if it were going wrap its tentacles around me and envelope me from behind.  I was so high I could't handle sitting up so I laid down on my back.  The being hovered over me as I felt my own tentacles project out of my back from my spine and move toward it.  Our tentalces merged and we made orgasmic spiritual love.  I then lost all sense of time or awareness of enything but our merging spirits. I felt unconditional total spiritual love.  I don't know how long this lasted but eventually I came back to my individual awareness and the being faded away.  <br/>
<br/>
I now had the sense that it had downloaded information into me and also recieved something from me but I could not pinpoint what that could be at the moment.  Then my mind began decoding and analyzing the information deposited into it.  I just experienced Tantra. Many different peices art I had seen flashed into my head and the realization that this artwork was depicting these beings.  I saw art from a Moche pyramid I had recently visited, Alex Grey paintings, the picture on Pacal Votan's Sarcophagus lid and various other pieces from many cultures that I can't individually remember.  I realized that at least in some instances, our spiritual form is that of the jellyfish.  We use our tentacles to spiritually communicate with each other and to extract bits of information from the energetic sea we are floating in. In our society we are not taught to use our tentacles for spiritual communication and this is one reason why the feeling of spiritual love is rarely felt by the everyday person.  <br/>
<br/>
I then quickly returned close to baseline.  The peak lasted around an hour and a half.  I was pretty much immersed in my own experience for that period of time and don't know what happened to the others during it.  My partner had gotten a migraine earlier that day and the trip didn't help it relax and consequently she barely got high.  I laid on the floor exploring my thoughts until it was time to go to sleep.  The two shipibos didn't speak english and I didn't speak much spanish so comparing trips was difficult.  My friend RL had a good trip but didn't explain it much to me other than describing a journey through space seeing stars, planets and comets.<br/>
<br/>
As I look back on the trip now, 5 months away, it has impacted my consciousness greatly.  I recall it often and can see how it has fit into the evolutionary structural pattern that my combined journeys have created.  I have not ingested a sacred medicine since then but will in the near future.  If you are interested to see how my trips on several different entheogens have integrated to create my evolutionary pattern look for my other posts under LSD, Mushrooms and Mescaline. Also a theory of Harvesting the Ego has sprang from these trips.  Remember, to truly understand an experience, YOU must undergo it.<!-- End Body -->
