 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span> <br>
<br>
The come up was a little rough as always, but the acid vibes made it a little easier. about 20 minutes after ingesting the 2c-e, I got into geek-talk with one of the guys there which I didn't know, saw that he had a nice first person shooter on his computer, and pew pew'd for about an hour.<br>
<br>
About 2 hours after ingesting, tim claimed that he wasn't feeling anything and wanted to re-dose. I was EXTREMELY hesitant about doing so, because 4 months prior to this experience I had one of the most paraoid and terrifying trips of my life because of a friend who said the exact same thing, was given another small dose, and vomited uncontrollably for 30 over minutes.<br>
<br>
After discussing it with them, I was convinced that he was, in fact, not feeling the desired effects. and thankfully I was not peaking by this time, so my visual comprehension was suitable enough for measuring out about 20 mg of the substance for him to take.<br>
<br>
About 3 hours after initial ingestion of the 2c-e and I was peaking. the house we were tripping in contained a bathroom that had mood lighting with a ton of settings, which we messed around with for a considerable amount of time, and kind of made it our 'home base' for the remainder of the long journey ahead. the combination of lsd and 2c-e will never cease to amaze me. pulsating, intertwining, geometric patterns weaving in and out, auditory hallucinations, and a fantastic body high.<br>
<br>
About t+5, tim and I felt like exploring. fortunately for us the house was HUGE. in one area of the house, he took me to a room, said 'I'll be right back', exited a door on the left, and appeared 15 seconds later from a door on the right, good times. we continued exploring for about another hour then headed to the basement where all the people in the house were either playing video games or watching TV. about this time I felt the effects diminishing, so i measured myself another dose. there's really no way for me to be sure how much it was due to my state of mind, but I'de estimate around 20-30mg.<br>
<br>
We smoked a few bowls of marijuana and got comfy on the couch as one of the guys started playing a pirated copy of Transformers (which was still in theaters at the time)on a projection screen. followed by a showing of Grandma's Boy (twice).<br>
<br>
Although we were all tripping, the 3 of us were essentially our own sitters. 'sir, you see this glass of water? I'de like you to have it.' when negative energy was felt by any of us, the topic of conversation was immediately changed and we went about our merry evening enjoying the vivid colors and patterns.<br>
<br>
The sun began coming up at around T+13-14 I would guess, maybe a little longer. I was still feeling the 2c-e, and jack, who had not redosed all night, assured me and tim that he was perfectly fine driving us home. normally after a trip as intense as this one was, I would need to either take a medication, or drink heavily, in order to fall asleep, (me and jack have drunken many bottles for that sole reason) but after the long night I was exhausted enough to lay down and fall asleep within an hour or two.<br>
<br>
this was an incredible experience, which I would mainly attribute to a 100% positive mindset through the whole night, and the company of friends who were just as aware and comfortable with hallucinogens as i.<br>
<br>
I haven't hallucinated in over a year and a half, but I will always look back on this experience with a smile on my face<!-- End Body -->
