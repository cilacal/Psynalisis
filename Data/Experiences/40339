The personal experience I want to relay took place on Christmas Eve/Morning of 2004 at about 12:24AM.  My intention of telling this story is to relay the events that happened on that magical evening.  I was visiting my Dad and had brought a friend along.  My friend was born in India and so never really had the family Christmas experience.  At the same time I who was born and raised in America wanted to experience a different Christmas tradition...  Namely the original Christmas tradition...  The sacred Amanita Muscaria mushroom from Northern Finland.  The same mushrooms that were used by the ancients.  For more information on this subject, check out the book The Physics of Christmas: From the Aerodynamics of Reindeer to the Thermodynamics of Turkey or the book by Jonathan Ott called Pharmacotheon: Entheogenic drugs, their plant sources and history.<br/>
<br/>
I must mention that these two sources were unknown at the time of this trip.  And that the history of the Siberian shamans had been passed to me from a like-minded friend.<br/>
<br/>
To start Nemo and I each ate a cap.  One small cap each to start.  You would do well to start small I noted from previous experiences from other people.  This was Nemo and I's first time eating the dried red and white ho hos.  We were both on a large wrap around couch in the basement watching satellite on the big screen.  Within 15 minutes we were both experiencing slight GI disturbances.  These disturbances were relatively mild in intensity and duration. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">Within 15 minutes we were both experiencing slight GI disturbances.  These disturbances were relatively mild in intensity and duration.</div></div>  After 30 minutes of discussing the science of the mind and flipping through junk on the tv I checked in with my friend.  We concluded we had to eat more mushrooms to feel anything...  We both had half of a large sized cap.  In addition he ate a stem and I ate a medium cap.  Out of a total of 30 grams it looked like we had eaten almost a 3rd.  A small dent to the total mass of the bag was made.  We both sat back.  I felt the cells in my body being pulled at.  A told Nemo that I felt a body buzz and he let me know he was feeling a slight buzz and fatigue.  I wished him goodnight and showed him to his room.<br/>
<br/>
Time alone now. Time to just relax.  The show I was watching was mindless entertainment, but at after a little bit it started to change.  Not the picture or the dialogue.  It was something so subtle it felt weird and alien but that was it.  Almost like spirits were trying to enter into the body's in the tv and speak with me.  I noticed my body beginning to tremble and felt cold.  My attempts at regaining warmth through blankets were futile.  This coldness was deep inside.  To combat the cold further I jumped into a hot shower.  A hot hot shower.  Hotter than I would have normally been able to with stand.  It made me feel comfortable in my body.  But it took a lot of external heat in the form of water.  You will sweat if you try to use a blanket to warm up.<br/>
<br/>
After the shower I went upstairs to a guest bedroom and crawled into a bed to stay warm.  I laid on my back and stared blankly at the ceiling.  Suddenly I heard someone's voice.  In that moment I thought I could either respond lovingly or coldly ignore it.  That this was all the time I had to make that decision.  So I did, I responded!  At first I thought it was my girlfriend's voice and that she came from the end of history to tell me something.  The conversation I cannot replay word for word because it was not in words.  It was in vibrational frequencies.  When responded in consecutively louder responses.  Each gaining in volume and emotional intensity and forming from passed memories the essence of eternity.  The source grew closer, until I saw it was Meg.  And closer until I could see my reflection. The source now washed through my entire being.  I did not think the trip would continue upon reaching this conclusion.  It did though.  It looped backwards and rewound into a final hiss.  I witnessed the vibration slither into a SSSSSSSS like that of a snake.  Very wet, I felt my being was a raindrop about to fall into eternity.  What came next was I was this dripping wetness.  Expanding wetness.  This I finally perceived was in fact my fully functional and working body.  I was so excited by what happened.  I was tremoring but the tremoring would be controlled as long as I used this energy to go on the right path.  I felt like a walking rain stick and perceived that some entity was trying to point me in the direction of its choosing.  <br/>
<br/>
At this point it was 3:30AM.  I called my mom to tell her that I had to go to Brazil.  It is still my wish today to travel through the southern Americas and Peru and visit the expert naturopathics of those regions.  At the time it felt like I had to at least plant the seed to make the entity happy.  This calmed me enough to fall soundly asleep and to reawaken completely refreshed at 6:30AM.  I felt vibrant the next day.  Made breakfast for my Dad and I and contiunued to try to wake Nemo up.  He finally crawled out of his home, said goodbye and left for a long drive back home.  He didn't even eat any breakfast.  I called Meg...  I said 'Did you feel that.'  She said she had indeed felt an energy connected to me wake her around 3:30AM.  Upon this awakening she thought of me and where I was.  Since the incident we have investigated further into these satellite receptions we are all capable of.  <br/>
<br/>
One experiment we had tried with much success was to record what time we feel each other while we are away.  This proves to be a really good way of seeing if people are really psychically connected.  In the town I live in, synchronicity is very high and these occurences happen  often in the course of a good day.<!-- End Body -->
