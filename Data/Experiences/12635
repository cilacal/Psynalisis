I had been having a very stressful week, and had been behind in all my work.  One day I decided to drink some coffee and finish most of the work do for my classes the following day.  So in preperation, I went to the store and bought about half a pound of coffee beans.  In order to garauntee premium caffeine content, I mixed all of the non-decaf beans together.  <BR>
<BR>
After I got home I took a nap and woke up at 10.  After doing a bit of work, I brewed 4 cups of my premium coffee blend.  It was amazingly strong.  It tasted at first like cinnamon, but had an aftertaste like onions.  It kept me awake and I finished what I needed.<BR>
<BR>
It was late and I did not want to stay up more than I had to, so I layed down.  I put on some Bad Religion and tried to go to sleep.  It took a while, but I eventually slipped into a slumber.  While I was sleeping I felt a massive jolt of energy surge through my body, not wholely unpleasant, but startling.  Suddenly my eyelids starting blinking at an inhuman rate.  I remeber staring at my wall, waiting for it to move.  I got lost in its endless pattern of tiny bumps.  I guess I'd call the experience ominous hallucinations.  I looked around my room, everything seemed ready to contort violently, though nothing did.  My eyes were still blinking rapidly.  I turned again on my side and tried to fall back into a more tranquil state.  The dream that I had was one of the most realist I have ever experienced.  Part of my bedroom turned into my algebra classroom, and I talked to my bassist joseph for a little while, then I returned to my bed and went back to sleep.  I can't recall our conversation.  It all seemed a bit odd at the time but nonetheless real.  Also, after only 2 hours of sleep I felt quite well rested in the morning.<BR>
<BR>
Peace to all<!-- End Body -->
