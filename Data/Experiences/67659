I recently got hold of some 2CI, having not taken any of the other types before, i did a little prep beforehand but didn't read to much as i decided to only take a small dose first to get a feel for the drug, unfortunately, as i didn't have a proper measuring device i ended up taking more than just a little taste and took between 15 - 20mg, who knew? - me after about 1.30h.  <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span> <br>
<br>
It was a Sunday night and i dosed at 8.00pm. I was home alone and wanted to get a feel for the drug before introducing it to my friends. <br>
<br>
The first hour was all waiting, so i decided to sit down and watch Top Gear, still at this point thinking i had probably taken such a small amount i won't feel anything. I decide to smoke a small spliff and get into the tv show, by the end of the show about 1.45h in on the trip i suddenly think, damn...this show has been on for ages (time dilation), at this point i start to feel muscle twitches and an energy pulsating through my body...i notice shadows and lights move around in my peripheral vision, colour also changes like with acid.<br>
<br>
By 2.15h in i start to feel really cold and realise that i have taken a stronger dose than expected, i'm not to worried but have a brief moment of paranoia but am able to control it and find that mentally i can still function quite well, i do have alot of thoughts in my head but i don't get stuck with negative thought loops like i do with acid.<br>
<br>
By 3.00 its still going strong, i find myself becoming very introspective... i don't like what i'm seeing, a feeling of displeasure washes over me and for some reason i feel angry at myself. I know that i'm the only person i can blame for my problems and realise that we all have our axes to grind, all of us humans, each trapped in our own heads experiencing the world subjectively. This thought helps me feel less alone and less trapped.<br>
<br>
By 4.00 i can feel the 2CI wearing off, a nice pleasant after glow for the next two hours. Trying to read is still a slow business as the text moves like waves in the sea. I watch some tv and find myself getting completely engrossed in to a show i would not normally watch.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
Despite having a much stronger experience than i originally planned, and some uncomfortable moments i really enjoyed the trip.  Next time i would like to take it with friends or at a festival as i found although i felt off balance when walking i had plenty of energy on this drug and feel i could hold a philosophical conversation quiet easily...Definitely worth experimenting with. <br>
<br>
Have fun and be safe.<!-- End Body -->
