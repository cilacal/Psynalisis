Ever been hugged by the Universe? – A voyage into the world of 5-MeO-DiPT<BR>
<BR>
I get home from work around 5:00 and see a note from my mom that my friend K had called. So I give her a ring back, she says to me “me and S just finished out tests, and we want to come down and do some drugs with you!”.  Not what I expected to hear coming out of her mouth. So I said, first off, I don’t have any drugs, I have some chemicals you guys are welcome to taste, and secondly, yeah sure, why not, come on down for the night! I was planning on just staying in and watching TV for the night since I had to work the next morning. I told them the menu of chemicals I had and they said sounds good to us, so we set a time and they sped on down to CT.<BR>
<BR>
They show up around 7:30 with some crummy weed, so I called up my cousin, and told him it was chemical night, so get over here with some KB and I’ll hook him up with something nice. Anyways we all sat down and decided who would take what and when. We came to the decision that I would get 16mg. of my remaining 26mg. of 5-MeO-DiPT, and the two girls could decide who got the other 10mg. since neither of them had ever tripped on it I decided 10mg. would be a safe dose, and my cousin had already experienced the world of foxy, so he was not permitted into the bargaining. K was nice and said S could have the foxy. K decided she would just take some ephedrine and smoke some herb, my cousin E decided to go with 500mg. of pure DXM powder I got from a chemical supply house, and then me and him would smoke some salvia and weed later on.<BR>
<BR>
S and me dose with the 5-MeO-DiPT in some OJ, and we go to Mickey D’s so my cousin can get a bite to eat.  My cousin then doses with the 500mg. of DXM.  So we all take off to go find a secluded spot in town where my cousin and me could smoke the salvia extract.  We find a nice spot in some dead end road in the “rich” neighborhood.  I decide to go first, since I was really beginning to feel the foxy creeping around in my system, I got that familiar gurgly feeling in my stomach, so I knew it would totally compliment the come up of the foxy. I pack about 120mg. toss in my “Deep Forest” album and let it rip.  Within seconds I was ripped out of the peaceful world I have come to know and love, and was tossed into my lethal tripping world. I have been to this frightful world a few times while on foxy and or Salvia, I couldn’t tell if I was alive or not, or what existing in the world even meant. I guess I told my cousin to drive, and get out of here FAST! I kept looking into the back seat asking the girls if I was alive or not, and I kept asking K to kiss me to prove that I was still among the living.<BR>
<BR>
We returned to my house and the fear continued, I began walking around my house in a hex, not knowing what to do, I eventually ended up outside in my driveway barefoot in the snow and ice with my cousin, I told him I was flipping out and had lost control of my trip.  I knew I needed my friends to bail me out, so I gathered them all up and said we had to go for a walk. We got my little puppy and took her with us. This is when the trip really got interesting.  Every footstep I took felt like it was pre-determined by a higher being, if I turned left it felt like it was pre-planned by someone or thing. If I tried to turn right and escape this force it somehow knew I was going to try to fake it out! I was stuck. Something was controlling my every movement.  I began to cry, not knowing what to do. I just grabbed onto my friend K and told her to take care of me. I finally arrived at a snow pile, and I looked down, my doggy looked up at me, and at that moment I knew I was going to be ok, that’s just the tough part I had to get through to find what foxy was really about. I felt a rush of empathy and relief flow over me at this moment.  I was released from the grasp of this higher being controlling me.<BR>
<BR>
We got back to my house and went to my bedroom, I guess I had freaked S out and she wouldn’t let the chemical get to her, she was trying her damnedest not to trip into what I fell into, this frustrated me since I knew how beautiful a good foxy trip could be.  She sat there watching TV with all the lights on and not closing her eyes to let the visuals in. Because of this I was brought back down to baseline at a time I should have been peaking. So I asked my cousin where his KB was, I went and thrashed through his jacket pocket until I found it, went outside into his car, threw on an ambient CD and smoked a bowl. Three hits later I was exactly where I needed to be, in the familiar and beutiful Universe I knew as the “Fox”. I sat there with my eyes closed and I could see these figures dancing around on top of my head, they looked like the big Goron dudes from the N64 Zelda games, sort of ancient Aztec like creatures/gods, they were all dancing around in tune to the music. Every beat in the music echoed through my heart and pulsated though my body up through their feet and they tossed the beat into the air, it was the most amazing thing I have seen since my first trip into the “fox”. K asked me to come back inside, she was worried I would do something stupid, so I felt obliged and did. I returned to my room, basically floating on thin air all the way up into my room. I was extremely “lifted” I told my cousin.<BR>
<BR>
I sat down on my couch and threw in my Fight Club DVD for my cousin who was tripping face off of the DXM. I just sat there balled up and closed my eyes, I could see my heart beats thumping through my body, they made ripples throughout my body on my skin, and they would eventually echo out into the universe in beautiful arrays of color.  The universe then saw my heartbeats and came to me, wrapped itself around me, and held me tightly like a newborn baby. I could feel a slight pressure all over my body, pushing down on all sides of me, it was the most amazing feeling I have ever had. It became a total body trip from this point on. K touched me, and told me I was shaking, I didn’t even realize it, and I couldn’t stop it, I was tripping so hard, that my heartbeats rippled through my body so intensely that it made me shake each time, it was truly amazing, I asked her to let me be.  <BR>
<BR>
The universe held and cuddled me for the next hour or so, I was lost in time until I decided to lay down in a sleeping bag on the floor, I laid there with a huge grin on my face knowing I was loved by the world and universe, this is what foxy is all about I said aloud to everyone in the room. Eventually after 2 hours of the most intense body trip ever I got some rest. I woke up the next morning at 8:00 for work, had a slight headache, but it went away after I ate some food.  After that I felt like a million bucks. All in all I would have to say this was one of the most beautiful trips that foxy has revealed to me, I hope to journey to it universe in the near future again.<!-- End Body -->
