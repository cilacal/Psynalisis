<br>
Previous experiences with coke, mdma, Ket, mushies, 5-meo-mipt, methylone, canabis, salvia, amphet, 4ho-mipt <br>
<br>
<br>
The nights menu... <br>
<br>
-roughly 40mg 4-ho-mipt (fumurate salt)<br>
-about 500mg methylone <br>
-god knows how much southern comfort <br>
- and ABSOLUTLEY NO common sense <br>
<br>
<br>
Myself (25) and girlfried (20) are lving at home at the moment with our respective parents as we're saving together for a house, dam expensive in UK. Anyways she was over at mine friday just gone, she was tierd so she bailed about 10pm. <br>
<br>
10.45pm --I'm sat there in my room with a bottle of southern comfort (dam I love that stuff) so I start drinking away whilst tappin on the PC. Soon enough I'm fairly drunk and decide to attack the methylone. I'm looking forward to this as I love MDMA so much and I've read its similar if less intense. I put 300mg in a glass of southern comfort and ice. Straight down the hatch <br>
<br>
+20mins- I'm feeling a little better about being me, slight buzz up my spine.<br>
<br>
+30mins- I'm looking through my mp3 collection for the trance music that is so fondly my friend whilst on MDMA.<br>
<br>
+40 running my hand through my hair feels quite nice, feet a little tingly, music sounds good, listening to ibiza euphoria, I'm feeling the music.<br>
<br>
+1hr At this point I'm very much wasted on methylone. Very MDMA like but not as empathetic or body heavy in my opinion. I Decide that it would be Ok to eat a pre-weighed out 10mg gel cap of 4ho-mipt. In hind-sight this was a bad idea since I was alone.<br>
<br>
1hr 30- Right about here things become so lost I just don't know anymore. I actully eat a further 250mg of methylone in southern comfort and eat a further x3 10mg gel caps of 4ho-mipt.<br>
<br>
I daze in and out of conciousness for god knows how long but do remember 'coming round' about 4am. Visuals are so unbeleivably heavy they're unreal. Spacial distorsion to an astonishing degree, rooms are so out of persepctive I'm unsure that I'm actully in them. I decide to go into the garden for a cig. As I sit there I feel almost god like. I sit at the garden table and I'm sure there are other dark spirirts sat around the table with me and I feel like some kind of intergalatic physcadellic being. I feel like a dark being, a deeply sinister and dark being surrounded at the table by other similar beings with starnge swirling bats flying around us. Visuals are very intense.<br>
<br>
I've tripped very very hard with mushrooms but this was harder and much more intense. colours were around me but they were not happy bright colours, they were dark colours, sinister colours that weren't conductive with happyness. It was unfoundingly scary stuff that I was absolutley unprepared for and unable to deal with. However, at the time, I didnt realiase how scared I was by the shocking intensity of it all.<br>
<br>
I go back inside and try to calm down. It doesnt work. I panic. I panic a lot. Grab a coat and go into the garden again. I jump over the garden fence and start walking at a ferocious pace, I walk about 4 miles to a local farmers field with a lake in the middle of it, my only mental reasoning at the time being 'theres water there, if I can get there I'll be fine.'<br>
<br>
I get there, still very much wasted as a fart and realise that the field is not actully the sanctury that I've been looking for. Its now about 6am. I sit down and watch the sun come up over the lake which was, I admit, very beautiful and nice to watch, but short lived.<br>
<br>
I kept telling myself 'Its a drug, it'll wear off' over and over again but when I got to about 7am things werent improving, people were turning up at the lake and I was still very much out-of-control and very much panicked. I was starting to get auiable hallicinations aswell, strange noises and noises from people that werent there. By this point I'm no longer drunk or under the influenace of the methylone however cannot understand why the 4homipt still has such an unforgiving and strong grip of me. <br>
<br>
I think this lack of understanding at the time stemmed from the fact that I was so wasted when I took the 4homipt. It wasn't till the following day, when I was fully 'down' that I realised how much 4homipt I'd eaten.<br>
<br>
Meanwhile, back in the field, I was using my hand as a 'How-much-am-I-still-tripping' gauge. I'd look at it to see if it looked any less weired than it had previous, and each time it looked like some horrid twisted tree branch, like something from a tim burton film, whats more, something that didnt belong to me. <br>
<br>
Visuals at this point are very much similar to those from psicoln/pysobin. Visual perspectives are skewed, surfaces are morphing and my mind is carrying my eyes. For instance, I'm sure my hands and coat are unusualy dirty, so when I look a them I see dirt marks and on them, they look manky and horrible, later I realise theat they're clean and fine.<br>
<br>
I assess the situation. I've walked at least 4 miles at the speed of a possessed beast fleeing the scene of a crime and drunk little water. I feel dehydrated. I ponder drinking water from the lake but am sure that will arouse suspicion from surrounding dog walkers. If indeed the dog walkers are really there at all. <br>
<br>
I check my pockets. Shit me. I have my mobile phone and its charged up. FANTASTIC. I think if only I could articulate my situation to someone. I have a 'test' conversation with my self to see if I can still talk. I can't. Not without sounding like horrible and un-natural. I can't think of words to say either. I barely rememebr my name. <br>
<br>
At this point I became very alarmed and feared very slightly for my life. Looking back I fell into a deep state of panic when I jumped over the fence and fled. I should have just stopped. Thought for a second, gone back, gone bed and sweated it out. Here I am wasted to fuck on some chemical I cant even remeber the name of, dehydrated, potentialy scaring the shit out of innocent dog walkers at 7am in the morning. I phone my best friend and partner in crime, M. M doesnt answer. I call again and again and again again. I'm getting cold as well.<br>
<br>
I text him. The mobile phone is very very difficult to use. I can focus on it visually but find it hard to fathom what I meant to do in order to acheive my desired outcome. All I can muster is 'NEED HELP....HELP.' No response.<br>
<br>
I consider calling 999 and asking them to take me to hospital for some form of treatment as I seriously consider the fact that I may never be right in the head again. As I mull this thought over I shed a tear to myself becuase I'm so so scared for my sanity. I still can't understand why the drug hasn't waned at all. In fact it has waned compared to when I was sat in my garden but I'm so panicked I don't recall this at all.<br>
<br>
I check my hand, still tripping hard I think. Still looks like a wicked evil tree branch. I consider calling parents and asking them to take me to hospital. Yes I decide, thats the best bet. I call home at about 8.30am. At this point the best thing ever ever ever ever happended. My younger (20 something) brother answered! We'll call him X. <br>
<br>
RINGRING <br>
<br>
'Hullo' <br>
'X...errr.....is that...err...X' <br>
'What you want?' <br>
'Is that X' <br>
'What you want' <br>
<br>
I was confused and didn't know what to say so I hung up, don't ask me why. I couldnt make proper words. He called me back.<br>
<br>
'I'm fucked up ner that farmer field, come for me please, bring water' <br>
<br>
The little star did just that, saved my bacon, and brought choclate. He talked me down, comforted me, walked me home, brought me water and reassured me that all would be well. I was still experiencing some degree of visual distortion till about 8pm at night. I was also running a high temperature, experiencing a stange body numbness and felt slightly disconnected from myself. I fell asleep @ 8pm than and woke 12hrs later about 8am next day.<br>
<br>
My god It felt good to be alive and Ok <br>
<br>
I'm never taking RC's on my own ever again!<!-- End Body -->
