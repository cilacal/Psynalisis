Quite possibly the weirdest thing I've ever experienced was my first contact with Amanita Muscaria. This was also my first contact with any form of halucinogenic drug. I can't really determine if it was overall worth it - some parts were fun, others were unbelieveably shitty.<br/>
<br/>
4:30 PM - Ate Amanita Muscaria (7 grams). My friend told me it tasted good, it quite literally smelled and tasted like shit. Just awful.<br/>
<br/>
5:15 - Smoked half a jay, a few bowls (cannabis). Around this point everything kicked in, muscimol and weed. We happened to be in a really forested area. Although I told my friend that it would be a better idea to trip indoors, we thought we'd just walk over to this dude's house before the shit kicked in. Ooops. I ended up on this foresty path where all I could see was green. I knew where I was, how to get out, where I wanted to go, yet I still felt like I was in some incredible place I'd never been before. At this point my mind was drifting on its own. I could've sworn I was walking through a huge puddle at one point - it looked, sounded and felt real, I was sure my legs were soaking wet - but when I looked down, it was just a dip in this grass trail. My state of mind wasn't that I believed that this was truly happening, I knew I was hallucinating - but every time I saw something new, I had to consider if it was real or not, because I wasn't really sure what to expect from Amanita Muscaria.<br/>
<br/>
5:30? - When we came out of the forest, we went across this bridge and leaned on this fence for a while. It bordered the field where kids played on of this elementary school. But it was Saturday afternoon, so there were only a few kids there with their parents. From across the bridge, there was this booming voice that said something like: 'Doth aerest ouest, gnake!' I wasn't sure whether or not the wizard who said it was casting a spell on me or telling me some words of caution that I couldn't understand. <br/>
<br/>
At this point I kinda forgot that I was hallucinating. Although there was alota cool eye candy, weird patterns, and shit, the craziest thing about this experience was the auditory hallucination. From across the field I heard some weird voices echoing in my head. Those kids were defenitely talking about me. I heard some weird voice that sounded like it was from a guy in space - he was saying something like: 'Those guys are so fucked up!' but it was ringing and echoing in unbelieveable ways. I made some incomprehensible joke to my friend, about how funny it would be to go flick that kid off, right in his face and say something like: 'Fuck you assfuck!', because then his parents would come over and bitch at us, and we could yell at them too, before we ran away. I was defenitely not in a good condition to be wandering outside. I wasn't violent though, only unaware of reality.<br/>
<br/>
5:45? - After hopping the fence, we walked across the field, which is weird because I don't remember walking across the field, but it must've happened, because we ended up on the other side. After walking up some stairs that I barely remember walking up, we sat down at this bench. I started tapping out drum beats with my feet, but they <br/>
sounded unbelieveably real - so I sat there for a while drumming out these awesome beats, which sounded exactly like I was playing a real drum set, till we got bored and walked over to this other dude's house. I don't remember walking there at all either. <br/>
<br/>
6:00 - Somehow we ended up on the street by his house, where other people were hanging out. I started to feel a little sick here, but not too bad. So I hung out on the curb and watched people skateboard, talked a bit, it was cool. I tried skating but I was too fucked up do do anything really. <br/>
<br/>
6:30? - Around this point all my happyness accompanied with being really high was completely gone. I have no clue what happened, but somehow I ended up sitting on this curb, drenched in sweat, going blind, and spitting every 10 seconds, while a sharp pain jabbed through my stomach. I was kinda worried cause I was salivating so fucking much - I couldn't help spitting so much. But I knew from what I heard that the easiest way to get a bad trip is to worry, or to think you are having a bad trip. So I tried to stay cool. Eventually though, it really started to get to me. I felt like I was totally wet. My entire body was drenched in sweat, my mouth was constantly wet, and my vision was so fucking blurry it was like being underwater, only worse, like my contact lenses weren't in.<br/>
<br/>
I have no perception of time here, but we did end up walking down to 7-11 at some point. I remember hearing that you shouldn't eat when your on shrooms and shit (Psilocybin or muscimol?) because it'll decrease the potency or maybe you'll be sick? But I decided fuck that, because I already was sick. So I think I had some green tea, but I don't remember. I know that we feasted on chips, hot dogs, a few candy bars and some slurpees though. I didn't know what the fuck was going on.<br/>
<br/>
8:00 - The aformentioned guy (not my friend who was also high) was being a dick, as usual, but finally we went into his house and chilled out. I never liked him much, but we did really need a place to go, and my friend who was high is pretty cool with him. Anyways, as soon as we got into his room, he started being an ass and wouldn't let us listen to Black Sabbath or Jimi Hendrix or anything, despite that like 5 out of 6 people wanted to.<br/>
<br/>
The rest of my trip was a complete blur, but the sickness wore off gradually. The stomach pain lossened when I got some food in me (this was probably more the fasting I'd been doing than the muscimol), spitting slowed down when I ate salty food, eventually stopped, then sweating and vision gradually returned to normal, although those two took the longest to return. Some point around 10 PM it was fading, so I smoked another bowl of some KB and went home. That extra bowl actually made me feel worse. When the muscimol was fading, trying to keep myself high with weed just made me feel really burned out and shitty. The next morning I felt similarly burned out, from about 10 AM to 3:30 PM, which is when I finally ate a decent meal. So food is really a good thing with Amanita Muscaria?<br/>
<br/>
I'm glad that I tried Amanita Muscaria, because of the experience gained. However, I don't think I'll be doing it again, if I do, not any time soon. However, trying Amanita makes me even more interested in experimentation with Psilocybic Mushrooms.<!-- End Body -->
