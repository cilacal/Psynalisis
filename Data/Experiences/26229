A short while ago I was over at my friend's house, we'll call her 'Billie Jean' because she isn't my lover, and we decided that it was time to have a taste of the 2C-E I had recently acquired from a mutated troll living under our nearby bridge.  And thus begins the story: <br>
<br>
Set:  Excited, slightly nervous as I usually am when trying a new substance.  I had not tripped in about 6 months and had been drinking more than usual, so I felt that it was time for a shift of perspective and some psychedelia to balance things out.  <br>
<br>
Setting:  BJ's large house, with good trance blaring.  <br>
<br>
Meds:  40mg Celexa daily (morning)<br>
<br>
Past Experience:  LSD, Mushrooms, MDMA, MDA, 2C-I, 2C-T-2, 2C-T-7, 5-MeO-DiPT, AMT, 5-MeO-DMT, DPT, Ayahuasca, Morning Glory Seeds, Salvia<br>
<br>
T+0:00 -  BJ & I each drink 20mg of 2C-E dissolved in some soda.  The substance was in the form of very fine snow-white needles that would try to float away while they were being measured.  It leaves a strange tingling sensation in the mouth similar to many tryptamines I have ingested in this manner before.  BJ reports the same feeling. <br>
<br>
T+0:15 -  First alert.  Hands are clammy & cold, strange feeling in the stomach.  <br>
<br>
T+1:00 -  Very mild visuals have slowly appeared by this point, but nothing very impressive yet.  Shortly after a very marked auditory enhancement appears, to such a level that I knew this was going to be a very strong trip even though the visual/mental were still weak.  For some reason audio is the first thing to be strongly affected in my trips.   BJ & I spend some time dancing around to the music and smoking cigarettes.  <br>
<br>
T+2:00 -  By this point visuals have become very strong.  The whole world is filled with twisting patterns and strange colors, and mental effects have increased to at least a +3.  BJ & I decided to go downstairs and paint her basement walls.  This is where we remained for much of the peak, and is also where I lost track of time entirely.  <br>
<br>
We painted for hours, first with brushes, then with our fingers.  The first was a crude drawing of a cat, then some birds and then we moved onto the floor.  I found myself imagining the paint on the floor as a sort of metaphor for the changeable nature of the planet/environment around us.  My thoughts soon shifted to some of my relationships with women over the past year, and I found that my painting became much more intricate and curved during this period.  I felt myself becoming female, or at least more feminine, which was interesting because BJ later told me that she felt herself switching back and forth between a male and a female identity.  After finishing up the cat / chinese dragon form that our scrawlings on the floor had evolved into, we decided that it was time for another cigarette. <br>
<br>
We went upstairs and marvelled at how the house had changed while we were gone.  My ego had been more or less pummeled into oblivion, and as we washed our hands in the kitchen sink we were completely unable to tell who owned which hand or how many there were being washed.  We washed our collective set of 4 hands together, trying to get the paint off but struggling to see where it actually was anymore through the strong visuals.   Our bodies had merged into one for a while, and the confusion only ended when I pulled mine out of the sink, leaving each of us with only our own set of hands.  <br>
<br>
The world was filled with insane patterns. This was stronger than anything else I had tried to this point, visually and mentally.  We headed outside to the porch to smoke, and I suddenly felt as if the house was being surrounded by people walking up slowly, as if not to excite me.  I had taken something too far, and had to be reeled back to reality by a collection of people before I decided that the egoless world of this drug was superior to the normal one where I knew exactly who and what I was at any given time.  This feeling was strangely uncomfortable, although not scary.  I was somewhat angry.  Who were these people to say what I could and could not do with my mind?  Well to hell with them, if they want me they can have me later, I'm going to enjoy this experience right now.  We finished the smokes and went back in.  <br>
<br>
The painting on the floor grew quite a bit larger, and I was still at what I'd call the peak.  We noticed the Chinese influences in our painting, and although neither of us had really intended it to take a specific form in the first place, it had somehow evolved into several figures and faces.    BJ & I finally got tired of painting, and went upstairs to listen to music and dance some more.  Another strange wave washed over me and suddenly I could not see BJ anymore, but could see from her point of view.  Neither of us existed as physical bodies anymore, but as points of reference from which the world could be viewed.  I looked up from the couch I was laying on and saw the empty room next to me.  Then my view switched to that of BJ's and I looked back at the couch, but what was my own body wasn't on it.  Just an empty couch.  I then found that I could view both points simultaneously and see twice as much.  Possibilities of events began flashing before my eyes, as real as anything else, and broke down into their basic patterns.  <br>
<br>
I felt somewhat overwhelmed at some point and decided to dance a while longer and stop thinking so much.  As I danced I watched as my skin first turned into bright neon outlines, then to points of light.  I was liquid dancing and watching my outlines of hands pass behind and through each other.  I felt as though I could dance better than ever before, and even that I had gained something from this that would allow me to in the future.  Suddenly, and without much warning, I began dropping over a 15-20 minute period until I was down to a more normal level of visuals, something like 200mcg of LSD or 1/8th of mushrooms.  Mental dropped as well to something like a +2 or weak +3, and I found myself able to communicate normally again.  I finally looked at a clock again and my warped little mind was able to comprehend it. <br>
<br>
T+7:00 - BJ and I decided that it was time for some of the Nitrous Oxide I had brought with for this event, so I broke out the cracker and went at it.  The nitrous did surprising little at this point, so we decided to save the rest for later.  We also decided to eat a Skelaxin at this point to relieve some of the slight muscle tension we had observed.  <br>
<br>
T+7:30 - Returned to the basement, and found that our painting had grown to take over about half the floor and an entire wall.  As I looked at it, I noted that I could pick a spot to look at and remember exactly what was going through my head while I painted it.  In fact, I found that I was able to do this today, even while looking at a small area.  Strange what the memory can do.  We sat downstairs and smoked and talked for a while.  <br>
<br>
T+8:00 - It was time for more Nitrous now, we were sure, but I couldn't find my cracker.  While digging through my backpack I suddenly noticed how much paraphenalia I carried around on a regular basis.  Empty Nitrous cartridges, an envelope full of the 2C-E & 2C-T-4 the bridge troll had handed me, crackers, balloons, spraypaint, razors, stickers, paint markers, dirty rubber gloves, and a miner's headlight were just some of my finds.  I quickly put the rubber gloves on when I found them and began pretending to be a police crime scene investigator categorizing evidence.  The item that most surprised me was an empty box of condoms that were dated very recently and had apparently all been used.  Now this confounded me.  The previous weekend I had been much more intoxicated than usual and had a fairly long makeout session at the bar that I barely remembered, but she didn't go home with me, did she?  Or did she?  I was completely confused, and BJ was just smiling at me saying 'you finally did it'.  <br>
<br>
I still wasn't satisfied, so I decided to figure it out later and the empty box went into the pile of things.  BJ named the pile the 'Orgy of Evidence', which was to be a black & white picture we would take and hang on her wall of the entire scene.  I was left somewhat confused the rest of the night about the origin of the condoms, and whether or not I've had sex, but I don't think that question will be resolved any time soon.  The rest of the night went by pretty uneventfully.  We were mostly down by the time BJ's boyfriend returned from work, and sleep came with some difficulty at T+14:00.  <br>
<br>
Retrospective:  Because I found 2C-I to be fairly weak mentally but decent visually, I made the mistake of expecting a similar experience rather than a full blown psychedelic.  This experience rivaled all of my hundreds of acid trips both visually and mentally, and I hope to do it again, although not too soon.  There is too much insight and thought to be gained from one trip on this to take it more than once every few months in my opinion.<!-- End Body -->
