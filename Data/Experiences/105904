So it all started when I went online to buy a research chemical. <br/>
<br/>
I tried a couple hallucinogens but at the time was looking for a synthetic cannabinoid. I saw MDMB-CHMICA so thought why not and bought a gram of it to make incense and sell a little as well to buds. <br/>
<br/>
So I waited a week and a half which was longer than the others but it arrived. I was scared of taking it because of its potency supposedly being in micro grams but said fuck it. <br/>
<br/>
I started out dissolving mabe 1mg dissolved in acetone and dipped a cigarrette in it. I smoked just a tiny hit and waited, felt nothing. <br/>
<br/>
So I smoked more, still nothing. So I finished that cig, went for another dipper this time added some more, now it felt good. I felt stoned not like other synthetics that were a little too potent. Anyways everything going pretty well, take note I kept cigarrette filter on and didn't inhale much because I hate cigarrettes ever since I smoked ecigs.<br/>
<br/>
Now back to the story, so later that night I decided to try something different, so put mabe 20mg of oregano in my bowl and possibly 1-5mg of powder onto the oregano. I smoked it and immediately started to feel something, it felt like pot it was just like it!<br/>
<br/>
<span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span><br/>
<br/>
I had a little more euphoria but so far so good. Three minutes go by and I notice it's getting stronger, not as bad as other synthetics but felt a little uncomfortable. So when it hit five minutes I felt it continue to build but no warning signs. All of a sudden bam sucker punch to the face I'm delirious. <br/>
<br/>
It felt like I was lost not like hallucinogens where you're still there in your head but a whole new level of trip I never experienced. I then got extremely sick trying to vomit but I could not since I didn't have enough food in my stomach. I just kept gagging and gagging. I'm now stuck, like I can't move, I can't process what's going on, I'm lost.<br/>
<br/>
Then it felt like I was in a video game, like I had this urge to complete a mission of some sort but couldn't figure out what I was supposed to do. Finally my mom heard me trying to vomit and she came running after she called me and got no response. She just appeared as I'm still trying to throw up and think about my mission. She looked weird not like 'Oh man look at the colors' but her face was distorted in a way you can't understand. <br/>
<br/>
She called the ambulance and I'm still frozen in one place trying to throw up. The ambulance came at the speed of light, like I thought it only took 2 minutes. <br/>
<br/>
Long story short I'm being asked questions about the drug I took, somehow I remember the drug name and kept telling them in my drugged up state, but they didn't get it till I said K2. They were asking me questions in the ambulance like 'Whats your name?' I remembered that, 'Whats your date of birth?' idk, 'Whats your age?' I said 13,17, 21,18,19, but I liked age 13 for some reason. <br/>
<br/>
Next minute I'm in the ER, I have nurses telling me to take off my pants and at first I said no, but then I was like hell ya lol so I take them off and wanted to take my boxers off but they never asked and in my drugged up stupor I was hoping but eyyy watever lol. <br/>
<br/>
So then I get an IV stuck in me, I'm saying I hate needles, I really hate them lol. <br/>
<br/>
I was worried about getting water and brushing my teeth since I just vomited a little at my house and I had cotton mouth out the ass. <br/>
<br/>
They refused to get me water because of the doctor for some stupid reason and so I never got a tooth brush, but fuck it. <br/>
<br/>
I'm tripping now I seeing patterns and colors as I close my eyes, eyes are rolling in my head, blacking in and out, heart beat monitor screeching off since it's 160 beats per minute, talking like an idiot almost like you're drunk kind of talk. <br/>
<br/>
After 3 hours finally started to come back but was still high as shit. Got to leave after 4 hours as I was some what fine again. <br/>
<br/>
I went home and slept it off. I woke up still stoned and it lasted for about 15 hours total. It was a terrible experience, the worst I ever had and I stay away from synthetic weed now because it's unpredictable. <br/>
<br/>
If you want to get delirious, super trippy to where it's weird and you can't comprehend it, and possibly die, this is the drug for you.<!-- End Body -->
