For a well deserved escape from revision, I decided to trip on some of my 2CE. I took some tweezers and pinched a seemingly tiny quantity, mixed it with water and drank it down. Around half an hour later I started to feel slightly nauseous, and I was noticing patterns in the carpet. I lay down, as I always do when taking 2CE, as this helps the nausea to pass within an hour. The visuals intensified, with complex patterns forming on the carpet that began to morph. This continued to intensify, and the ground seemed to appear in focus closer than it was ow and again.<BR>
<BR>
I was now tripping harder than I ever had before. I've done a lot of heavy shrooms trips and 6 blotters of acid, but the visuals I was experiencing now far surparssed any trip I had experienced before. My sober friend was revising in my room, so i decided to watch Fear and Loathing for the first time, which was very cool. Eventually my friend went to bed, and I decided to take a walk outside, and go and smoke some weed, which usually compliments hallucinogens. I smoked two bowls of good bud, and I've never been hit by weed like this before.<BR>
<BR>
It was like a combination of the most stoned I had ever been before crossed with Salvia, and both of these two expereinces took place on the same bench as my experience now. I constantly forgot what I was doing, and kept finding myself staring ahead. I felt intensely body stoned, and had to concentrate to walk in a sober fashion. My sense of touch was also the most sensetive it had ever been. I stared at a tree, whose leaves seemed to morph and ripple with life. I then went for a walk, and found myself easily distracted. I then walked back. On th way bach I saw some strands of blue plastic - I always noticed these when tripping on acid because they were so vivid. I was having intense closed eye visuals in a variety of distinct colours including red, orange, green and yellow. The visuals were so strong and had a 3D  feel that I had never expereinced before, and I could see them clearly with my eyes open (it was dark after all). On observing the blue plastic, the blue superimposed itself onto the visauls writhing around, and then the plastic began to twitch itself. <BR>
<BR>
On getting back to my room I looked down at the road - on hallucinogenics the tarmac usually takes on the appearance of Roman mosaics - this time the patterns were incredible, and in many distinct colours. Tracers from moving images, or when I was looking at a stationary object and moved were also very obvious.<BR>
<BR>
The carpet, wall on woodgrains in my room showed amazing visuals. On the carpet, the textures glooped and moved resembling red ants or blood flowing in capilaries. The wall showed incredible pattrerns that I could control. If I thought of life the patterns would blossom, if I thought of death flames or teeth and bones would from. The woodgrain were breathing and flowing like waterfalls, but the shadows were twitiching and flowing like sand.<BR>
<BR>
The most amazing visual was these 3D visuals where bits of dust would seem to zoom towards me-exactly like I was in an asteroid field.<BR>
<BR>
the whole experience left me tired, and I took a while to get to sleep. The weed had a HUGE effect on the intensity of the trip. Next time I might add a few blotters of acid-meant to give interesting results. There was no hangover, and today I was able to do 8 hours of revision ( a lot for me in any state of mind). An incredible expereince that I definately want to repeat.<!-- End Body -->
