  A few days ago I recieved a new shippment of AMT in. This time it was in freebase form so I decided to free base it.<BR>
<BR>
     4:30 pm- Freebased 15 mgs didnt taste that bad and the smoked didn't really hurt my lungs,  noticed my head felt kinda light.<BR>
<BR>
     5:30 head still felt light. figured that nothing was going to happen<BR>
<BR>
     6:30 my pupils are very dialted I feel very sped up, I am walking around my house very suped up.<BR>
<BR>
     7:30 I am sitting on my lazyboy watching a local music tv show with some jazz/funk band playing I close my eyes and I can set very profound geometric patterns moving around in my head no color tho only back and white. When I open my eye eveything looks quite weird for a few seconds (kinda grainy) <BR>
<BR>
    7:45 I decided I need to get in a pitch black room, so I start walking up stairs to a bathroom. on my way I stop at a mirror and I end up staring at it watching my face change and look really weird, first my face went blank. looked like it got erased I stare at the miror for about 30-45 minutes<BR>
<BR>
   8:30 I finaly get to the bathroom, its pitch black so its perfect, first I notice a huge spiraling geometric pattern around me all over, I pulled out this little glow toy I have and started spining it around, I was seeing lots of trails.<BR>
<BR>
   9-11 I guess I platueaed during this time because nothing changed<BR>
<BR>
    11:30 visuals about stoped still felt very speedy like mdma kinda,<BR>
<BR>
   12:30 Went back down strairs and watched The Wall, very good movie<BR>
<BR>
   2:00am damn I want to go to sleep but I can't I was getting very bored<BR>
<BR>
   3:00am eeehhh still can't sleep<BR>
<BR>
   4:30 ok this is the 12 hour making still very speedy<BR>
<BR>
   5:30 eehhh one more hour or so<BR>
<BR>
    6:30 I took and asprin and feel asleep<BR>
<BR>
    10:30 woke up I don't feel really tired still feel alittle weird in my head<BR>
<BR>
conclusion<BR>
this isn't a bad drug for raves and long parties, or concerts. drink lots of water, stay in the dark, don't redose (I had thought about it and am glad I didn't). its gunna be a long trip so prepare for it, I would recommend taking it around 6 or so, so you starting coming up when its dark. maybe some sleeping pills might help?<!-- End Body -->
