The one year old frozen San Pedro soup from 8 odd foot of green columnar matter, a third of which did very little a year ago was beckoning to be re-tried, this time with two friends, A and U, both drinking for the first time. Not happy with last year's barely threshold outcome I did not want to take chances and obtained 2 more feet of SP and 4 feet of E. Lageniformis. Soup was again made, permeating the living room with that 'green grass mixed with acrylic paint' aroma while A. Jorkowsky's masterpieces lit up the tv screen. Mixed the new and the old soups together and slowly reduced both to around 12 mouthfulls of potion. <br/>
<br/>
We fasted that day, set up camp at a nice secluded beach, drank 4 mouthfulls each at around 1 pm. Spend the next hour or chatting away,  recording yet-to be watched interviews onto a video camera while nausea slowly crept in. All of a sudden it was on. U all of a sudden exclaimed that 'she understands me now.' A was lying in the tent, in his own little world, he has told me on the way to the beach that he wonders what sex would be like on this. I told him it is not a good idea... He still tried to put the moves onto U, in an intoxicated state, saying he felt sleepy. BS..:) there was no talk of sleep, this was only the beginning, but I could feel the energy of both and his possessive vibe was sucking U down. Outside was a sunny hot day, the hills and the rocks and the plants were radiating with an ancient prehistoric quality and an intelligence and obvious personalities. It was like seeing with clear eyes, free of judgement. Seeing nature's patterns. Could not help but see intent also. A. was still trying to seduce U. U's younger cousin was also there, not partaking but looking after us. I knew that funky time with A was not what U came for, and I called them both to get out of 'the cave' and into the world. Finally U came out. <br/>
<br/>
A (tired) immediately sat up, shitty, everything written over his face. In about a minute he was having the most powerful purges in his life, getting it out of him for the next half hour, after fasting. black stuff came out. U and I did not throw up. We sat on the beach by the water and talked, open, watching A wonder around the edge of the beach 100 meters away, almost as if unable to approach us to join in the conversation, resembling a weird animal, with his screwed up grimace and gait. We took a dip in the shallow water, keeping safety in mind (*no one was going swimming that day). The shimmering sand looked back at us and light, reflecting off the sand particles at different angles thus different colours formed persian patterns. Only an hour had passed. U was getting lost. She wanted to go out into the sea and never come back. I had to pull her back by providing a link to this world. People come looking. People forget what they are looking for. Most of them are looking for love and happiness. U was looking for love too. She could see it now. She could say it now. A came up and threw up in the surf. The ocean swallowed it, along with the heart sign I drew on the sand around U, to show her and bring her back. <br/>
<br/>
Both A and U had difficulty moving. I felt like singing and dancing and running and doing cartwheels, as i did, but playing the guitar and singing into the wind at the ocean was harder than usual still. U started saying she loves everyone. A went back to his tent and was enjoying the dark erotic visuals similar to 'Devil's advocate'. He was alright though. U kept getting lost and again I had to stay with her and talk to her. A would come out and ask us what we were up to and the beach would respond. The cicadas stopped chirping and everything went quiet, until he went back in the tent. The evening came and then the night. The sand formed deserts, and pyramids the stars came out, the moon rose out of the water in a fiery show and it was followed closely by a red planet. A son and his dad walked in the night to check their fishing rods, two wandering beams of light. Sting was a perfect soundtrack in this beautiful tranquility. The sun rose and surfers came, along with the flies, which would only bother me when I thought negative of them and got annoyed, and left us alone when we accepted that they live here and we are guests. We all were still altered when it got hot, so fruit and nuts came in really handy as snacks. Finally at 10am we were sober.<!-- End Body -->
