Location: Back seat of a car with my friend while on my way home.<br>
Time: 7:30 PM<br>
Mood: Anxious/excited/slight nervousness<br>
<br>
My friend had been telling me over the past couple weeks about a drug Adderall, which he had been abusing tremendously. He took up to 200 miligrams a day of this stuff and told me that since I was interested in eventually trying cocaine, I may like it. I took 30 milligrams with a Mountain Dew: Code Red, and waited. It was 7:30 at night.<br>
<br>
We got to my house about thirty minutes later and I think the effects started to kick in. I walked in my house and went to the bathroom while my friends pulled out of the driveway. One thing that seemed to be different so far was my heart rate. My heart was pounding very fast and I felt full of energy. I had looked up on the drug 'Adderall' over the past week for a good amount of time and saw that it was an amphetamine. I was excited, I had always wanted to try speed, so here's where it started.<br>
<br>
I laid down in my bed only to make phone call after phone call for the next five hours. I felt amazing, like nothing could stop me. Any position I sat in was comfortable even though it seemed like I sat in the same exact position only moving my mouth while being on the phone for a constant five hours. Every time I thought of something that made me 'anxious' or 'excited' my heart sped up real fast. Same thing goes when my mom or someone were to walk in my room, or if something, anything were to startle me. When this happened, I noticed a rush of numbness run across my chest, throughout my extremities. It was quite pleasurable. <br>
<br>
When it came to be approximately 2:00 AM I realized I wasn't sleeping that night. So I sat staring at my fan spinning for about four hours. I was still sitting in the same comfortable position as I was for the past five hours mind you, the first time I moved was at 6 AM. I felt tired inside, even though I wasn't. I'd kill to sleep right now, as I knew the pills would not last all through school and I would end up crashing. That's the last thing I wanted. It was a Friday though that day so I figured 'What the hell.' <br>
<br>
I got up at 6:00 AM to take my shower before school. I looked in the mirror and saw that my pupils were not only changing from big to small real fast, but were also different sizes. Honestly, that was one of the freakiest things I have ever seen my body do, probably due to the sleep deprivation it made me real paranoid also. I remember reading that all appetite will be suppressed before I took the pills. They weren't kidding. Eating ONE taquito was damn near impossible. Chewing it was the hardest thing I had ever done in my entire life, let alone swallowing it. I went out when my friend came to pick me up for school after grabbing a caffeinated soda, which probably wasn't the greatest idea for my heart which was still beating very, very fast. I think I sat there and counted approximately 120 beats/min to begin with.<br>
<br>
When I arrived at school, all my friends immediately asked me what the hell I was on, as my pupils were like saucers and I didn't look too good. Hell, if they noticed the second I walked in the door, I'm wondering if my teachers noticed at all. In classes however, I felt super concentrated on whatever I was doing. My notes were perfect, I wrote all important information down for the first time in my life. I had a big test that day also. When I took it, I was so into it I took too much time and failed. The comedown began after that period. I was extremely tired and out of it at about 1:30 and my pupils were going back to normal. My eyes were supposedly 'glazed' however. People were asking me if I was stoned. God, I wish I was stoned at that time compared to how I was feeling.<br>
<br>
When I got out of school I went to a friend's house, still feeling like utter shit and got literally five minutes of sleep then two other people came over and we all decided to go to a show to see a few local high school bands that were playing that night. I felt a lot better at this time. I ate some food at Wendy's, but instead of buying a drink, my friend brought some Bacardi Hurricane stuff (12.5% alcohol) in a powerade bottle. Drinking that to quench my thirst was probably a big mistake. I think at the most, I had the amount of alcohol equivalent to a beer and I relapsed on the Adderall.<br>
<br>
At the show, my pupils got big again, my heart beat came back to over a hundred beats/minute, and the feeling like shit came back as well. I was spacing out the entire time there which was about three hours between the times of approximately 9-12 pm. When I got home, my pupils were still humungous and I was afraid to go to sleep in fear I wouldn't wake up. I was so tired though that when I laid down, I did fall asleep at 1:00am. First real sleep in 42.5 hours, it felt good.<br>
<br>
After this experience I dreaded the dextroamphetamine Adderall. I never thought I'd ever do it again. About a month later I gave it another chance in intervals of 20 milligrams at a time working my way up to 30 and I find it enjoyable. I think the downfall was taking it a few hours before going to bed, or trying to at least. School tired me out. Now when I take it, I feel great, full of energy and full of the will to learn.<!-- End Body -->
