I use to read reports of how some people claim caffeine ruined their life.  I would sit here and think to myself how stupid these people were.  I thought they were just looking for something to blame because their life wasn’t going right.  I see now that I was truly wrong.<br/>
	<br/>
First off I arrived at my friend’s house, where the party was being held at, around 5:00.  We had two half barrels of high life, two cases of cheap beer, and about 5 bottles of hard liquor.  We really had a lot of alcohol for only like 20 people.<br/>
	<br/>
I had planned on getting totally drunk that night but I didn’t was to pass out so I bought a bottle of NoDoz.  I was hoping on being totally blacked out drunk but not passed out.  It was going to be great! <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">I was hoping on being totally blacked out drunk but not passed out.  It was going to be great!</div></div>  I could hardly wait.<br/>
	<br/>
So at around 5:30 I popped 4 pills and this boy was like “wow, that’s just like drinking 14 cups of coffee”.   I was like “great, this should be fun”.  About 20 minutes after that I got really hyper and could not stop running around the house.  I felt so jacked up.  It was kind of fun.  Then around 6:30 I started to feel sick.  My stomach really hurt and I felt like I could not drink but it was new years so I was going to anyway.  I also started to worry about the silliest things.  They were so stupid but I could not stop thinking about them.  I than started to get really depressed over nothing.  My friends would come in and ask me what was wrong because I was just sitting alone in a totally different room like some antisocial loser.  I would say  “these caffeine pills got me feeling weird”.  Also as I drank the whole night I could not get drunk.  That really pissed me off.  Everybody was having a great time and mine was boring.  <br/>
	<br/>
To make a long story short—My stomach hurt, I did not get drunk, I was really depressed and paranoid, and I was up till 6:30 in the morning.  It was such a bad experience.  Also trying to make myself throw up did not work.  I spend about an hour trying that.<br/>
	<br/>
I would really like to tell everyone that caffeine is really bad for you and not to do it.  I have cut all sodas with caffeine out and everything that has caffeine in it.  I really think it is bad for caffeine to be legal and pot to be illegal.  I mean caffeine makes people edgy, makes you look strung out, and makes your body hurt.  To me caffeine is one of the worst drugs to do.  Also I am very experienced in drug use.  I have done just about everything that is around in the Midwest.  I have even done drugs such as datura, DMT, oxycontin, crack, and pills galore so you can not say I am some inexperienced sissyboy that does not know what he is talking about.<!-- End Body -->
