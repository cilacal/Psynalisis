<!-- Start Body -->
I was experiencing an era of my life where I was experimenting with many different substances, yet led no addiction to anything aside from my more than casual Marijuana and Adderall usage. One of my favorite treats though was using opiates, my absolute favorite type of drug. Since I started experimenting with various opiates I've always spaced it out so I wouldn't increase tolerance and keep the spending low and with-drawl potential low. This was until I met an endlessly reliable connect for oxy 80's through work. I began to go through at least one 80 a week consistantly for around a month and a half, by the end of this time period it took 40mg of oxy to feel the same effects that 10mg used to bring on.<br/>
<br/>
I've never been really addicted to a substance, so I knew this habit wouldn't be too bad to break, and I didn't mind the possibility of with-drawls since I would be able to lower my tolerance down eventually. With all of this in mind I opened up my George Harrison digipak CD case to find I had roughly 60mg of oxy left. I told myself this would be the final use of oxy for a month minimum, by then I'd be back to baseline pretty much. I thought of how amazing it would be to blow all 60mgs, realizing 40mg does me great I figured my tolerance would be able to handle 60 without a problem. It seemed I was wrong, but I'll never forget this series of events and feelings of drugged up Euphoria.<br/>
<br/>
I cut the 60mgs of oxy into 2 lines, I proceeded to blow roughly 30mg into one nostril and instantly began to feel calmed down and relieved, this was my way to escape all of the pressures ofcourse. After sniffing a few times in attempt to get the oxy to drip, I then blew the remaining line into my other nostril. I exhaled excited for that usual perfect glow to slowly build all around me, and wrap me into its euphoric blanket. I put on a mixed playlist of Dream Theater, Morrissey and Blind Melon and began to post on my favorite forum to pass the time it takes for the drug to peak. Within 25 minutes I began to nod out rather hard, filled with complete bliss I was over-filled that the experience was hitting so hard and quick. I was nodding out imagining full conversations and actions to constantly re-open my eyes and realize I was only imagining them. This always happens when I take a mid to high range of an opiate, and is one of my favorite effects.<br/>
<br/>
Pretty soon I was keeping my eyes closed as the music seemed to flow all around my body, sounding so amazing and as if it was perfectly created for me and this moment. I noticed I was have the vivid imaginations stronger and would only open my eyes from a full body jolt. While I am not sure if this was truly the case, I began to slightly panic at the thought and realization that my breathing had greatly shallowed and slowed down. In my drugged up state, I figured that the jolting was my body attempting to keep me alive. I quickly remebered I had a 20mg Adderall XR in wait, so I crushed the beads and swallowed the mixture in a small amount of water. I continued to jolt out of my perfect comfortable state every minute or so, it was not like a seizure or anything that made me panic too much, I was still feeling amazing and wasn't sure if it was serious or not.<br/>
<br/>
Within 15 minutes I began to feel the tingling sped up onset of the amphetamines, I noticed I became more aware and the powerful opiate high seemed more calculated and noticable. I still was zonked out but able to force myself to breath at my normal pace. I became annoyed at having to keep myself awake because of the slight fear that I'd fall asleep and stop breathing, so I had an Idea. Keep in mind that I was zoning out and Adderall has the ability to force you stuck onto an idea or goal until It's completed. I decided the only way to perk up would be to get some cocaine, I shook the idea off as I hadn't done it in awhile and attempted to get up and make coffee. It was quickly becoming evident to me that this was a much harder task than originally anticipated. I kept zoning out and closing my eyes, nearly falling over every couple of seconds. I determined I wasn't going to make this coffee and sat down on my couch. I needed the coke. <br/>
<br/>
I called my buddy (lets call em R) and asked if he could drive up and get some coke and bring it to me, he proceeded to tell me how I should come with em. Within 5 minutes he was at my place and I jumped into the back seat along with 2 other kids. I was nodding out and barely even able to keep a conversation. As we began driving a rotation of 2 blunts began to go around, I told myself it would most likely not help me out to smoke trees at this time, but I did anyway. Each blunt had around 1.5 of some dro, and we finished them off while boxing in the smoke. I was not able to see  more than a few inches infront of me. The weed made an extremely strong synergy with the Stimulation of Adderall and the downing euphoric bliss of the Oxycontin. Soon we met up with the dealer and I bought two 15 bags containing .2 of really good coke in each. Normally I buy grams from a great source, but this was the only guy around. R dropped me off back home and I stumbled back into my house in a sleep walking like state. <br/>
<br/>
Being completely ripped out of my mind didn't help me very much as I was nodding even harder as my heart rate and breathing was greatly lowered. I poured both little baggies out and cut 2 large lines containing .2 in each. I got out my lucky blue straw and snorted each line, 1 in each nostril. within a minute I was feeling the super stimulation and euphoria from the coke. I was too fucked up to turn any music on and rather paranoid from the combined amphetamine and coke tweakage, and finally I was alot more aware and my breathing was better. After about 3 or 4 minutes enjoying the rush from the cocaine I decided to lay down on my bed. This was the most intense and confusing combination of drugs the human body can enjoy.<br/>
<br/>
It was late at night now, so my natural tiredness combined with the oxy was still putting me out. The trees added a psychedelic depth to the high, plastering an uncontrollable grin upon my face. The Adderall combined with the trees and oxy added wonderfully to the stimulation and feeling of well-being given by the amphetamine alone. The insane top off would be the rushing euphoria and ultimate stimulation of the cocaine. The combined feeling of these four substances was an indescribable sensation, it was as if each substance was battling with each other leaving a war of pleasure upon me. <br/>
<br/>
This experience greatly slowed down my use of opiates and substances in general. Although this X-mas break I've dug into drugs quite a bit as a break from the usual school, job and sports ruling my life. It was a fearful experience, but through the dangers of combining these substances I was able to feel a high not many people experience. I think it was not the best idea to mix these things. When I woke up in the morning, I was still messed up a little and the entire day before seemed like a dream.<br/>
<br/>
Keep expanding your mind.<br/>
