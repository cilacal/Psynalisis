It was only my second time rolling, I'm not really into raving or any of that.  But my friend was having a party where everyone was going to be rolling.  I brought my friend J with me, and we each bought a tab.  Like I said I am not experienced with X but they said these were very good tabs, and I certainly rolled a lot harder than my first time.  Well my friend and I were having a good time, it was good to chill with some people I hadn't seen in a while, and there were new people to meet, and since everyone was rolling we were all very social.  About 2 hours after we ate our tabs I suggested to J that we should do some 2ct7.  I had been doing a lot of 7 this summer, but J had only tried it once, and at a relatively low dose.  I had a vial of 7 with 10mg dissolved in alcohol in my pocket, and he agreed to do it with me.  We had each just spent 20 bucks on tabs, so we couldn't afford to use up that much 7 so I suggested that we should shoot it.  We had never shot it before, but my friend who hooks us up with the 7 suggested 2mg as a good dose for shooting, although she had never done it herself.  J and I cooked down the liquid into a powder which we redisolved in water, we then each shot 5 mg intramuscular.  It is difficult to tell exactly how long it too to kick in but it was even faster than snorting.  The peak was also difficult to follow, but that was probably due to the rolling.  But for quite a while that night I was watching movie on every surface in the apartment, and when I would talk to people they would begin to melt, pictures became real and started to move and interact with me.  It was not at all scary though, I felt intensely euphoric and incredibly happy to be with everyone to a much greater degree than when I was just rolling.  After a while I noticed that J had disappeared and I began asking if anyone had seen him, but no one had.  My friend's apartment is part of a house type building and is on the second floor, there is a staircase leading up to her door, which has been decorated with hundreds of posters and such.  I went to her front door intending to go out and see if I could find J outside, but he was in fact lying on the stairs staring at the walls.  He later explained that all the posters became real and he experienced them all, all of the concerts and movies and plays all became totally real to him , and the walls began to move and distort.  He was totally happy to be out there, I asked if he wanted to come inside and be with everyone, but he explained he was totally happy just lying there, and I let him be, he came in a few hours later and was unable to communicate with anyone, but was just very happy nonetheless.  A couple hours after this while we were still very fucked up (I think the X and 7 played off each other to extend the effects) we went to church, I have never enjoyed church music so much, we sat and listened and watched the closed eyed visualizations.  After 3 hours of church we went home and slept very well.  The whole experience was very pleasureable. Shooting is much more effective, and requires a LOT LESS substance, we normally bump 8-16 mg.  If you want to really enjoy 7, and it really is a beautiful drug then I highly reommend it.  This is just me though, but I hope this information is helpful to someone. Have fun!<!-- End Body -->
