Preparation<br/>
<br/>
I began by peeling and cutting two 15” long and 3 ½ inch wide cactus using the green and white tissue while discarding the core. Once cut and prepped this came to about 6 pounds of usable cactus. I then placed the cactus in the freezer to break down the cell walls overnight. (Due to the variability of the potency 2 weeks prior I used a 6” piece as a potency tester) Based on how I felt I estimated that this time it should have come out to just about 500 mg for each of us. <br/>
 <br/>
I put the pieces a couple of hand full’s at a time into a blender and a little water in with them covering the cactus about ½ way and blending for about 30 sec. After the sludge was put into an 8 quart stainless steel pot I turned the heat on to med and began simmering the cactus. Because of the potential for heat damage I decided to get a meat thermometer and kept the temperature as close to 160 degrees as possible adjusting the temperature as needed. <br/>
<br/>
I simmered the cactus for 4 hours then strained it through a very thin t-shirt. Then I put the tea back into the pot and simmered it till the water had evaporated and left me with 16 ounces of liquid. I then put the cactus juice into 2 plastic flasks and into the fridge for later that day.<br/>
<br/>
The Experience<br/>
<br/>
T+00:00     My wife and I had finished setting up our camp site and checked our watch, it was 5pm and we were ready to get started so I poured the juice into 2 coffee mugs and cut up a few lemons to help with the taste. We drank the juice over a half hour sucking on lemon wedges to help kill the taste.<br/>
<br/>
T+00:45    Starting to feel just a little off we decided to go for a walk to the camp sites bathroom. We weren’t really much yet but did feel like a sense of calm had come over us.<br/>
<br/>
T+1:15     The first tracers appear, colors seem brighter and I feel kind of drunk. I feel like all I want to do is sit down by the camp fire and close my eyes.<br/>
<br/>
T+2:00     I feel the Mescaline kick in. Over the course of 10 or so minutes Tracers become more pronounced, the ground starts breathing and I start to feel a wave of euphoria wash over me. I remembered how much San Pedro cactus is like MDA. We decided to go for a walk again. We were looking up at the stars and they seemed to pop out of the sky as if they were much closer to us. I almost felt at one point like I could have reached out to one. <br/>
<br/>
T+2:30     All of a sudden it hits me really hard, something keeps trying to pull me into a trance. We decide to go lie down in the tent and trip out for a while. Every time I would close my eyes I would get lost in this weird environment of colored lights and organic flowing shapes. I couldn’t help but to keep rubbing my feet together and my hands started to shake a little bit each time a wave of euphoria came on.<br/>
<br/>
T+3:00     I was tripping really hard by this point with both open and closed eye visuals  What I was seeing, feeling hearing and thinking seemed to become all the same. I was definitely at a good level 3 trip by now but the interesting thing about mescaline for me is that it’s not forceful; I could go out really far or come back to clear headedness just by desiring to. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">the interesting thing about mescaline for me is that it’s not forceful; I could go out really far or come back to clear headedness just by desiring to.</div></div>  Everything was just this flowing bright swirl of things and objects morphing into each other. This went on for about 4 hours.<br/>
<br/>
T+7:00     Around midnight I felt like I was starting to come out of my trance. I still wasn’t coming down but the trip seemed to take on a different character. I wasn’t drifting anymore but instead was feeling very analytical. I was having very intense open-eye visuals. The ground, walls, sky, etc. were flowing like they were made of thick liquid. Flashes of bright colors of all kinds but mostly red and orange were going off like strobe lights in front of my eyes. Objects would strobe or have halos around them. Things seemed to merge into geometric patterns and shapes.<br/>
<br/>
T+8:00     By now I realized that I was definitely past peak. I started to feel kind of uncomfortable. I was still tripping pretty hard but not enough to want to stay awake anymore. I told my wife that we should smoke a bowl because it would bring us back up for a while then when we crashed from that we should be able to fall asleep. <br/>
<br/>
T+8:15     What hit me I was not expecting. I knew that I needed to go lie down because I was leaving reality. I felt this sensation like I was moving at a very high speed I looked up at the stars and they were spinning around in the sky then falling like shooting stars. Everything started to strobe in bright fluorescent colors then morph into rainbows. My wife and I were trying to go into the tent and were having a really hard time figuring out how to get in. After a few minutes we finally get the zipper open and go inside. We were feeling cold so we were trying to put the blankets over us. I think all we were actually doing was to play with the blankets; we kept looking at each other laughing because we couldn’t figure it out.<br/>
<br/>
T+8:30     I lay down and shut my eyes I was feeling so intense that I just couldn’t keep them open any longer. I lay there and watched all of reality, my body, mind, and thoughts disassemble themselves into a bunch of random bits and pieces. Thinking of anything as separate from anything else didn’t make sense. Everything was one and the same. I had just begun my first level 5 experience with San Pedro. I had no notion of having a body anymore; my entire being was a hodgepodge of disembodied incoherent thoughts. I was morphing into different things then back, my thoughts and visions were gibberish. I was trying to come back to some sense of reality as this was really not expected at all, then I saw an alien with an elongated head. He sat down in front of me and every time I would try to come back to reality he would draw my attention back to him and say look, look at me. If I had not have known better I would have thought I took DMT, the experience was that strong. <br/>
<br/>
T+10:00     After what seemed like forever I started to come out of it. I laid there thinking holy shit what a ride that was. I'm not sure how long I was laying there before I feel asleep but I think it was a while. My wife woke me up at about 1pm the next day and things were back to normal. I still had a very calm centered feeling that lasted the rest of the day. <br/>
<br/>
Retrospective <br/>
This was definitely the hardest I have ever tripped on San Pedro The character of the experience was very flowing and organic. While I didn’t have any grand spiritual revelations I hoped that the experience would help me unwind and it did just that (HA Ha at one point completely unwound.) I felt centered and peaceful the next day so I would see this as a success and certainly a lot of fun……<!-- End Body -->
