First of all i would like to make it clear that i am rather experienced with psychedelics. I have done more than my fair share of DXM, salvia, shrooms, absinth, 2C-I, 5-DMT, E and while not psychedelics, i also have more than enough experience with amphetamines, alcohol and pot. My favorites so far are shrooms, DXM, and 2C-I. Unfortunatly i have done too much DXM in my time that i can no longer stomach it.<BR>
<BR>
Untill this date i had not mixed 5-DMT and 2C-I, so since i had both on hand i decided to try combining them since while both hallicinogens, they have very different effects. I would describe the effects of 5-DMT to resemble a sort of mental silence, that all but the deepest thoughts are quiet, letting one listen to one's self. 2C-I on the otherhand can be quite overwhelming in the sence that it can feel as if there are a million voices in one's head, all talking at 50 miles/hours.<BR>
<BR>
The night started off with me taking 20mg of 2C-I in a napkin, after making sure to have a very light dinner, only vegetables. I then sat down to watch Sid and Nancy and wait for the effects to kick in. In only 30minutes i was feeling the onset, and in another 30 minutes i decided to retire from the movie and take a bath. The bath was incredible, not only was every sensation enhanced, but i was able to see myself through the eyes of many different people and refine certain aspects of my personality.<BR>
<BR>
After what i was certain had been at least 3 hours, i exited the bath. i was shocked, it wasen't even 11:00pm yet. I then spend a rather large period of time wandering throughout my house. I would think of something to do, then while walking over to do it, i would become lost in my thoughts. this lasted untill about 11:30 when i decided to lay down on my bed since i was enjoying thinking more than wandering around. At this point of time, anything i focused on would distort in mushroom like visuals, however the mental aspect of the trip was much deeper and more intense than any shroom trip. <BR>
<BR>
After quietly meditating for a half hour, i decided i was ready to smoke the 5-DMT. I was a bit nervous at first because i have smoke too much DMT in the past and the effects can be too intense. so i loaded a fair bit into the pipe and decided to start off with just a small hit, when after the first hit i was not feeling much, i took to average size hits. At this point, i became totally in control of my mind and trip. I could silence my mind to the point of ego loss, or fallow thoughts from a hundred different perspectives, or even choose to percieve reality the way i do sober. Basicly i had absolute control, so i decided to shut off my mind for awhile and just take in everything. At this point i had some very intense visuals, flying into different worlds exsisting through posters and images lying around my room.<BR>
<BR>
I spend most of the night in such a state, the only problem was that i was unable to fall asleep untill 6:00 am<BR>
<BR>
One warning however, sometime during the night, i'm not sure at what time, i decided to see if i could perform the simple task of driving my car around the private raod that surrounds my house. That was a mistake, while i am still surprised i did not hit anything, i did scare the living crap out of a deer, and while the whole drive couldn't have lasted more than a minute, when i realized i could not function properly and would quite likely crash, i spend most of the drive as a paranoid mess.<BR>
<BR>
Appart from that, the evening was a success which i will be trying again soon only with company, a seven hour trip can get very lonely. and as everyone reports, there was no hangover the next day, i was just pretty tired from only getting 4 hours of sleep.<BR>
<BR>
By the way, while most people will be able to handle the effects of 2C-I, 5-DMT should only be used with caution by experienced psychonauts, as it is not only very strong and easy to take too much, and when i mean too much, i mean WAY TOO MUCH, but i also can numb the lungs and throat, giving a sensation of suffocation.<!-- End Body -->
