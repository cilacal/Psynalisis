The whole reason I took this was to give me an idea of what to expect on LSD since people say its easier on the body. I will never do this shit again. This stuff literally feels like I'm frying my head. I won't think of abusing this chemical because one time is enough. Be wise.<br>
<br>
2:00 P.M.<br>
T:+00:00<br>
<br>
Dosed 1 mg tab bucally between my upper lip. I notice a slight chemical taste that is similar to 2c-e (which is the only psychedelic I have tried before this). During this time I was picking out weeds and since my dad wasn't coming back home until the next day I wanted to try this RC out.<br>
<br>
2:30 P.M.<br>
T:+00:30<br>
<br>
I finished my job and the come up was perfect. Similar to 2c-e, but without the fuzzy feeling in my head + the body load wasn't at all that too bad. I decided to ride my bike through the neighborhood around a big lake. <br>
<br>
2:45 P.M.<br>
T:+00:45<br>
<br>
I notice something very strange. My own dog was behind our Swedish neighbor's fence.  Yeah. I was like what the fuck? I noticed they weren't home so I grabbed her and took her back to my house. My mind was starting to get twisted and kept thinking if the neighbors didn't think I took care of my dog enough or if the neighbors are just freaks.<br>
<br>
3:15 P.M.<br>
T:+01:15<br>
<br>
Half an hour went by trying to fathom why my dog was at my neighbors house and I realized I was tripping. I go into my dad's poker room which has a cool Baywatch pinball machine. I notice David Hasselhoff's face looks like he's a giant compared to all the other people painted on the pinball machine. That was my first alert of visuals were starting to form. I have many bird houses and the purple finches were swarming with trails of tracers following behind them blending into whatever color was around them. I see why people say they have pastel type visuals. I smoke one ultra light cigarette to settle in because whenever I'm on 2c-e the smoke is mesmerizing.<br>
<br>
3:30 P.M.<br>
T:+01:30<br>
<br>
Things get real fucking cartoonish. The lines on my back porch turn really bold and my depth perception is totally twisted. I feel as I'm tall and small at the same time.<br>
<br>
4:00 P.M.<br>
T:+02:00<br>
<br>
I decide to listen to a santana record and dose another 1mg tab because I feel real mellow and nothing scared me because my last trip was on 35mg of liquid 2c-e and I felt I had the power to turn fear into curiosity.<br>
<br>
4:30 P.M.<br>
T:+02:30<br>
<br>
My brother and step-brother come home and they didn't notice I was tripping so I decided to wait to tell them until they started drinking because they aren't to happy with me doing synthetic shit and eventually I knew I'd be tripping balls.<br>
<br>
5:30 P.M.<br>
T:+03:30<br>
<br>
Things are getting real crazy and my brothers and I go into town to get several 40's.<br>
The car ride was really weird because I though I was going way too fast and I start breathing really hard and they knew I was on something so I told them. They were cool with it and said they know what it feels like. They calmed me down and I felt really good once we got back home.<br>
<br>
5:45 P.M.<br>
T:+03:45<br>
<br>
Felt so good I dosed another tab. After 30 minutes of it in my lip I accidentally swallowed it and I was glad because I forgot about it and then the blending of colors of everything got real fucked up. <br>
<br>
6:30 P.M.<br>
T:+04:30 <br>
<br>
Holy shit is all I could say for this part. I was sitting in my living room and listening to music (Primus). I could hear every instrument playing and single individual ones out. The sound felt like it was going into my ear and out the other ear and every other open bodypart you could think of. I could feel crap moving through my intestines and the blood pulsating through my hands. I didn't see any walls breathing or anything, but the walls turned into new walls of a different shade of color of whatever was on it. I felt like I was on a quest and rainbows were bursting out from under a cloud were the sun was.<br>
<br>
7:30 P.M<br>
T:+05:30<br>
<br>
The hardwood floor in my living room had so much detail on it and after focusing on it that's all I could focus on and from then on I started to think I was shaggy from Scooby Doo and the swirling detail on the wood was crawling up my arms, shirt, walls, and basically anything around me.<br>
<br>
8:30 P.M.<br>
T:+06:30<br>
<br>
At sunset I wanted to take one last ride on my bike and as I was coming the hill I closed my eyes. As soon as I opened them I realized I was in mid fall and fell on my left wrist. The next day I went to the doctor and I actually had a hairline fracture. After the fall things were really trippy because I thought my left arm was turning purple and I couldn't really feel out of that hand much. I kept thinking I was alright because I didn't see any bone sticking out which relieved me.<br>
<br>
9:30 P.M.<br>
T:+07:30<br>
<br>
Still didn't have much feeling in my wrist and hand. My brother had me watch Fritz the Cat and it blew my mind because of how real it looked. If your ever tripping on anything, I recommend watching it if you perceive yourself as a psyconaut or some shit.<br>
<br>
10:30 P.M<br>
T:+8:30<br>
<br>
I walk outside and the stars look like they are swirling and the moon is in a crescent and was literally orange hanging right above a tree. Everything was giving me a positive vibe. The moon was actually orange too because I took a picture of it.<br>
<br>
12:00 P.M.<br>
T+10:00<br>
<br>
Holy shit my hand/wrist is burning like hell and I decide to go to bed before it gets worse as I come back to consciousness. As there is complete silence in my room I start to have faint auditory hallucinations like I hear myself thinking in actual gibberish and all types of sirens are outside my window. I feel so fried at this point I decided to drink myself to sleep with some fucking nasty kessler since I didn't have any benzo's or other liquor.<br>
<br>
11:30 A.M. <br>
T+21:30<br>
<br>
I woke up and felt fried, but I wasn't tripping at all and it was hard to think. It has completely faded at 3:30 P.M.<br>
<br>
Please don't take this if your an adolescent just looking to get high. It is really unpleasant if your not in the right setting. It takes balls to control yourself on this stuff especially if your break your wrist like I did. There was so much more to this trip, but I would have to write a book to even explain it.<!-- End Body -->
