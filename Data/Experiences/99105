This wasn't my first time trying 25i. I had tried it twice before but it was my first time taking two capsules. I wasn't expecting it to be a bad trip... I was WRONG!!<br>
<br>
One Saturday night I decided to buy two capsules since my parents were going to a concert and three of my friends came over. They were all going to stay sober but me.<br>
<br>
I took them at around 9 when my parents left and didn't feel the effects until I was 45 minutes into the trip. Waves of different colors were appearing on my bedroom walls while I was laying on my bed.<br>
<br>
One of my friends fell asleep and two others went into the living room to play the PlayStation. I was left alone and by this time I was tripping balls.<br>
<br>
I felt my heartbeat racing, I tried controlling it by telling myself that everything was going to be okay, that I was just tripping. But instead of helping it got worse. <br>
<br>
I began feeling anxious, I was clenching my jaw, and my heartbeat began to beat faster and faster.<br>
<br>
I got up and walked into the restroom were I splashed water in my face. There is were the worst part began, I was at the peak of the trip. The anxiety grew into another level, I felt as if I was going to have a heart attack. <br>
<br>
Thought like 'I am going to die' 'I'm going to call 911' ran through my head. It was all happening so fast but it felt as it was never was going to end. <br>
<br>
I began to feel lightheaded... I had the feeling as if I were going to DIE! My breathing was becoming faint.<br>
<br>
Unable to talk to anyone for help I began to tell myself that I needed to calm down. That it was all in my head. So I began to breath in and out. Finally everything calmed down and I went to sit down with my friends in the living room.<br>
<br>
I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS.<!-- End Body -->
