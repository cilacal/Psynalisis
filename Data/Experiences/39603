The report I am writing is explaining about my first time ever drinking a real amount of alcohol (all other times were simple sips).  I was in the middle of high school when this experience happened, so I am probably quite a 'lightweight' to most of you guys.  I have never touched tobacco or cannabis.<br>
<br>
The last time I tried to drink alcohol, all of my friends got really drunk, and I was busy dealing with them.  By the end of the night, I never got a chance to drink.  I sure learned a lot that night though, mainly that you need to be careful about how much alcohol someone around you consumes (two of my friends probably got alcohol poisoning that night).  <br>
<br>
So for my first time, I was careful to make sure the enviroment around me was safe and easy to interact with.  I knew that I was going to use the computer and my Xbox, so I made sure both were up and running before I would consume any alcohol.  My mom was going to bed early due to work she had the next day, and so I designed my preparations around not waking her up mainly.  At the time of writing this, I can be pretty proud about the preparations I took, and it led to no complications.  Planning ahead definitely has its benefits.<br>
<br>
I had my 'plan' all thought out days before, and it was only a couple of hours before I would start drinking.  All I needed to do was wait for my mom to go to bed, and I would be off drinking.  However, I had one problem with a cold that I had for quite a long time.  I started coughing a lot, so decided I needed to take some sort of cough medicine.  I had Dayquil and Nyquil, and at the time it was 9:30 pm.  I knew I'd be up till around 3 am, but for some reason I thought that Dayquil would keep me up all night.  I knew that Nyquil is a powerful drug, and it will combine with the alcohol to do some negative effects, but I chose to take it anyway.  It was in my stomach for around one and a half hours before I started to drink, and I was starting to get really tired.  This effect eventually went away.  I think Nyquil might have had a big effect on my body that night, but I am no expert, so I don't know for sure.<br>
<br>
Right before my mom went to bed, I actually had a lengthy conversation with my mom about alcohol, and I eventually realized I didn't need to be so secretive about it.  I still decided to stick with the plan of her not knowing, but now I know if I get caught it won't be as big of a deal.  My mom went to bed, I waited about 20 minutes, and then the 'show' began.<br>
<br>
The first thing I decided to drink was all of the whiskey I had on me, and I mixed it into orange juice.  I honestly think I didn't have enough to even get a 'buzz,' so I chugged the whole orange juice/whiskey combo while holding my nose.  It was 11:00 pm when I did this.  I played one game of Halo 2 online that lasted around 10 minutes, and then I went down stairs to chat on my computer.  It was after about 2 minutes of chatting that the effects really hit me, I mean, I never expected the effects to hit me so fast like that.  I drank this strong old red wine that my mom had, and then I went back upstairs.<br>
<br>
I was totally new to alcohol, so the effects surprised me.  The world around me wasn't a blur at all like I thought it would be, but I felt really dizzy.  The only way I could compare it to is when you are one of those spinning rides in a theme park, and you can feel the G-forces weighing down on your body.  The only difference was that I could move my body much more, and the feeling didn't make me feel bad at all.  I had fun just moving my head side to side, because it just felt cool moving my head.  I also noticed that walking felt really weird, I kept stumbling and had to keep holding onto walls in order to walk.  Tastes in my mouth also felt really numb, and I fear that most people that are drunk can start drinking a lot of hard alcohol without feeling the taste.<br>
<br>
I knew I needed to try out the 'social' aspects of drinking, so I started talking to my friends on Xbox Live while playing Halo 2.  I am usually pretty timid, but I noticed that I kept talking almost nonstop.  I knew it was also the typical slurred speech you get from drunks, and I kept trying to make my speech intelligent, but I always failed.  Alcohol basically screwed up my speech, but I could still think fairly good.  I could see that my inhibitions were lowered, and it didn't really bother me at all.<br>
<br>
At around 2 am, I knew I was coming down.  One of the odd things about alcohol is that the effects come in waves, in which I feel the effects greatly, and then it goes down to an almost sober feeling, and then back up again.  I was in a continued state of feeling the lower 'sober' feeling, so I knew that I was coming down.  It was at this point that I recognized the true danger of alcohol.  I felt very tempted to go and drink more in order to get the higher 'feeling' that I had, but I knew I shouldn't.  The next day, I felt like getting drunk again, and that really scared me.  I had no hangover though.  I can see why this is a drug that requires A LOT of respect, because it is so easy to abuse.<!-- End Body -->
