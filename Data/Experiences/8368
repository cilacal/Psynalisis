After seeing a couple of my friends take this substance I finally decided to take it myself. I decided to take it on a Saturday even though I knew I had to work Sunday afternoon, because my friends told me that there was no hangover. <BR>
<BR>
I took about 8 milligrams of the powder, it tasted horrible and had a taste that was hard to get rid of. The first thing I noticed was a general restlessness and I started pacing around the room. I played a couple of CD's but didn't find them particularly appealing. <BR>
<BR>
Within 20 minutes of taking the compound my pulse was rising. I was expecting effects similar to MDMA, although as it turns out it is completely different from MDMA. <BR>
<BR>
As the body buzz grew more intense I started to feel incredibly cold and wrapped my self in a blanket even though the room was around 80- 85 degrees. <BR>
<BR>
Soon after the chills started the mental effects got rolling. My thoughts slowed down and I found it hard to keep up with the conversation that my friend, Rob, and my girlfriend, Marci, were having. Colors became intensified and my eyes became more sensitive to light even though there was relatively little pupil dilation. The mental effects bared some similarity to marijuana and also psilocybin but wasn't very visual. <BR>
<BR>
There were no closed eye patterns and my surrounding only seemed vaguely different in a way that was hard to explain. The mental effects of this compound had absolutely no similarities to MDMA although the physical component is more intense but similar. <BR>
<BR>
There was absolutely no mood elevation and the ever-increasing body effects were making me nauseous. I felt that I was going to throw up. I went into the bathroom and dry heaved for a few minutes then decided to go to the bathroom. I had diarrhea. <BR>
<BR>
After cleansing my bowels I felt better but was still cold. Rob asked me if I could feel the heat from a nearby candle. I put my hand by the candle and barely noticed the change in temperature. I lowered the palm of my hand to just a few centimeters away from the flame but still felt nothing. I held it there for a few minutes. <BR>
<BR>
Rob tried holding his hand there for a few seconds and got burned. I commented how in trance states some people can walk on fire and not get burned. I have been able to do a similar thing on MDMA but not on any other compound. <BR>
<BR>
As the trip wound down about 5 hours after dosing I felt normal but anxious and full of energy yet somehow lazy at the same time. I decided to smoke some Marijuana with Rob. This is very atypical for me as I normally find the stupefying effects of marijuana too be annoying. I thought the combination might be good. <BR>
<BR>
As it turned out, I was right it seems that 5-Meo-DIPT greatly reduces the mental slowing of marijuana and the marijuana decreased the agitation and stomach upset of the 5-Meo-DIPT. There was definitely some synergy between the two compounds. <BR>
<BR>
I meditated before sleeping and found that it was easier to reach a trance state than normal. I woke in the morning feeling unusually well rested even though I only slept for a few hours. I felt a pleasant mood elevation that lasted a couple of days. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Another occasion I tried this compound I decided to up the dose to 15mg. <BR>
<BR>
The agitation was subsequently increased although the nausea was lessened because I had decided to fast that day. I felt pleasantly aroused although I was not as incredibly horny as my girlfriend became on the higher doses this compound. I had heard from my girlfriend that this chemical increased sexual pleasure significantly for her. I decided that it would be a good idea for us to have sex. <BR>
<BR>
Tactile sensation was definitely enhanced by the compound and the anxiety and nausea were temporarily gone during lovemaking. I wonder if this is because of some unknown synergy between the endorphins released during sex and the 5-MeO-DIPT. It also makes me wonder is opiates would show any synergy with this chemical. <BR>
<BR>
After sex I closed my eyes and was greeted by some very interesting closed eye visuals. Pictures of Snakes, DNA, and dendrites danced before my eyes. <BR>
<BR>
An hour after sex my nausea and agitation returned. I wished I had some marijuana as it is evident that for the last few hours of the trip the only significant effect is the bothersome agitated feeling and insomnia, which are easily cured by smoking pot. <BR>
<BR>
My girlfriend got drunk and reported some synergy with alcohol although I didn't want a hang over so I decided not to drink with her. <BR>
<BR>
I tossed and turned that night but eventually fell asleep. Even after the fitful night I felt a pleasant happiness throughout the next day just as I had on my previous experiences. <BR>
<BR>
<BR>
SPECIAL NOTES: Many people have reported that 5-MeO-DIPT provides a smoother transition for the more powerful tryptamines such as DMT and 5-MeO-DIPT. <BR>
<BR>
DPT and 5-MeO-DIPT is a particularly intense combination and many people have reported religious experiences with this particular combination, as it seems to extend the duration of the DPT trip considerably. <BR>
<BR>
Some men find that taking 5-Meo-DIPT along with it can relieve the erection problems caused by MDMA. Taking 5-Meo-DIPT at the same time as psilocybin or LSD causes it's effects to become partially obscured behind the stronger psychedelic compound so that only it's erotic effects and body load are noticed. <BR>
<BR>
5-MeO-DIPT has proved to be useful to me in achieving deeper meditative trances than normally possible although mystical experiences are not as prevalent as with other substances and aren't normally achieved without at least some degree of practice. The body load of this substance stands in the way of this compounds potential for spiritual work involving concentration, as it is easy to end up concentrating on the body discomfort instead of the desired magickal task. <BR>
<BR>
Marijuana can be especially beneficial if one desires to do magickal work with this compound because it increases the visual aspect of the trip and decreases the body discomfort. Sexual pleasure and sex magick could be greatly enhanced by this compound. Visuals often increase after having sex and the nausea of the compound is decreased. <BR>
<BR>
Like MDMA, 5-MeO-DIPT increases tactile sensation. Unlike MDMA, however 5-MeO-DIPT will not cause any erection problem and even makes achieving an erection easier. This chemical may actually have some future in the treatment of male sexual dysfunction.<!-- End Body -->
