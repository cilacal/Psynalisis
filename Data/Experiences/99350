<!-- Start Body -->
My friend (A) took his 25i in blotter form around 4:00pm while we were on a two hour road trip. About an hour later, A said he was starting to feel the effects. I took my 25i in blotter form [Reported Dose: '10 micrograms'] around 5:00 pm, while my girlfriend was driving. The blotter tasted like pill dust and it made my tongue feel cold and tingly. <br/>
    <br/>
About 20 minutes later, my body started feeling heavy and my head I felt light headed. I thought I was going to vomit for a minute, but I opened the car window and my stomach felt better. The car started overheating as there was an antifreeze leak. We pulled over and my girlfriend was putting antifreeze in the car and waiting for it to cool down. I looked at the trees and the sunset, and it was beautiful. The trees started moving. I wasn’t concerned about the car breaking down at all. I said “We can figure it all out tomorrow. Today is a good day”. I was very happy.<br/>
  <br/>
We got the car home. I live in an upstairs apartment. I looked up the stairs, and they felt very narrow. I had trouble walking up them, and had to go one slow step at a time. Once I got up the stairs and into my apartment, I immediately went to the bathroom. (Sorry for the graphic details here) I went to pee and my stomach started hurting. I had diarrhea. Wiping my ass was quite difficult, as I was tripping and couldn’t tell if I was actually getting myself clean or not. It was a bad experience. I decided to take a shower. I washed myself very quickly and then decided to sit down in the shower. The shower felt awesome on my back, but I got claustrophobic as it felt like the shower walls were closing in on me. I got out of the shower and had trouble finding clothes to wear.<br/>
	<br/>
After I found clothes, I went into the living room where A was watching tool music videos. I could hear every individual note, and it felt as if the music was spiraling and filling my whole body. I felt completely ecstatic. I couldn't stop smiling.<br/>
<br/>
At the peak of my trip, my girlfriend put my tye dye blanket over my head. I started pawing at the blanket, moving it back and forth away from me, and laughed hysterically. My fish tank was spectacular. The fish were changing colors, and I watched my turtle eat for a half hour. I watched visuals on my big screen, getting completely sucked into them. I danced to mgmt. I hula hooped to dubstep. Hooping was specifically easy on 25i, as I felt more in tune with my body and the inertia of the hoop. I was amazed at how circular the hoop was, and I could easily do tricks that are normally hard for me to do. I got out of breath easily, though, and got very sweaty. I craved water, and ice was abnormally fun to chew. I laughed at random things and wasn't concerned about what was going on with the five other people at my house. Occasionally I would tune in to what A was laughing at and would laugh with him. If there was anything semi entertaining, I was laughing at it. A left the house around 8:00pm to go get some weed with some of our other friends.<br/>
Throughout my trip, everything I looked at had patterns. Most of the patterns were hexagonally shaped. People’s faces looked very strange. Looking in the mirror, my skin appeared flushed and had strange pigments. I later looked at pictures from the night and my skin looked fine. I noticed towards the end of my trip that my jaw was very tense, and it hurt. My upper neck was very tense, and when I started coming down I noticed I had a slight headache.<br/>
<br/>
A got back around 11:30pm. My girlfriend rolled two blunts and I smoked in hopes to calm myself down. It was about 12:30am when my trip started ending. The weed got rid of my headache, but my jaw still felt really tense. I went to bed around 1:30am. When I laid down and closed my eyes, all I saw was pictures. My closed eye visuals were mostly geometric patterns and random colors, which made me very dizzy. I started laughing for no reason. Again I tried to close my eyes and go to sleep, but the noise from the fan was affecting my visuals and making me dizzy. I turned the fan down and tried meditating to calm my visuals, and I eventually fell asleep.<br/>
<br/>
The next day I woke up around 9:30am. I felt very tired. I did not feel hung over so much, but I did have a slight headache and didn’t want to go to my classes. Until about 4:00pm I felt unable to focus.  I felt fine after that.<br/>
<br/>
My girlfriend took the same amount of 25i two days later, but although it made her visually trip, she did not feel high and she was not as giggly as I was. This leads me to wonder if 25i erodes over time like LSD does, or if it was just affecting her differently. <br/>
<br/>
I would compare 25i to the 2ce experience. Very similar visuals, but with less twitchy feeling and no spine chills. The come down was much easier, as well. With 2ce I was unable to sleep at all until early in the morning, regardless of whether or not I smoked weed with it. With 2ce I felt like shit the next day.  After I got past the closed eye visuals and dizziness, I was able to sleep comfortably on 25i, and did not feel all that bad the next day. There were no spiritual awakenings or reality checks that bled into daily life. I would say that this drug is a fun experience for recreational use, but it is not adequate if you are looking for something to bend or open your mind.<!-- End Body -->
