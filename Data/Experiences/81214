I was 7 years old when I had my first experience with amphetamines, I'm diagnosed with legit ADHD, and Aspergers Syndrome (high functioning autism) when I was 7. I started first on Ritalin, I responded well to this miracle tablet that helped me concentrate on my school work. I don't remember much of my first experience as I was switched over to dexamphetamine sulphate 5mg after 1 year on the Ritalin, mainly because the dexamphetamine was cheaper than the Ritalin, and my parents couldn't afford the $100au per box, so I was put on the dex.<br>
<br>
After the switch of medications I actually did notice a major difference, I was better to concentrate on my own in school, I taught myself how to read, I could write 10 pages of a story that I could just make up using my stimulated imagination, I also used to be a maths genious, and I could talk to anyone.<br>
<br>
My first experience where I felt an actual buzz from the medication, I was about 9 years old, and been taking dexamphetamine for almost a year and a half and my mum made me take an extra 10mg in the afternoon as I was being difficult and refused to do my homework, because it was the amazing tablet that made kids behave and do learning and stuff. I knew it would help me get my homework so I thought it would be okay to take it, I remember being extremely fidgity for that evening, and I didn't get to sleep until the sun came up the next day. Sure enough my parents got me up and re-dosed me and sent me off to school. The teachers at my school noticed I was misbehaving, and they didn't believe me when I told them I had taken my morning dose, so naturally I was re medicated, the wort part of it was that the teachers didn't tell each other that I had being medicated.<br>
<br>
At recess break, a different teacher also thought I was misbehaving and I was forcefully medicated again, the same happened twice at lunchtime by 2 different teachers. Each time I was dosed I was given 2x 5mg, in total that day I was forced to take 10 tablets, 50mg of dexamphetamine sulphate, I was getting very paranoid at this time, I distinctivly remember hiding in the garden thinking the teachers were going to attack me and do something horrible to me, I remember having a strange pain in my stomach, then I went tropo, I fully flipped out as one of the teachers approached me, scared for my life, Heart pounding like crazy, I was chased into the main building where I ran up the stairs and started throwing chairs, tables, bricks over the balcony, basically anything that I could throw at them. I was untouchable, not even by my own friends. No one could come near the stairs for the rest of the day, I didn't want any more medication. I could actually tell that it was the medication that was doing this to me by that point. <br>
<br>
Eventually three teachers had the courage to come up and try and stop me, They pinned me to the ground. I was in a state of absolut panic, they forcefully restrained me while I was kicking and punching them, I thought I was fighting for my life. With one teacher holding my arms, another holding my legs, the third teacher I kicked quite hard, she didn't want to touch me. I was carried down the stairs and taken out to the gate, where I was set free. I eventually calmed down after the priest from the church across the road came out to try rid me of my demons. There I stayed until the end of the day. I was extremely physically and mentally exhausted. <br>
<br>
After a while my parents came and picked me up. I went home and slept straight away on the couch.<br>
For me, that was the end of that. Only a few weeks ago I was talking to my parents and I mentioned this incident, as it turns out, my primary school didn't even tell my parents what had happened, all that they were told was that I was misbehaving a fair bit and I was removed from class for the rest of the day. <br>
<br>
Although it was a traumatic experience, I still had no say about taking my medication, but my view on how it helped me was changed forever <br>
<br>
I strongly recommend to any parent who considers to have their child use this medication to make sure  the child's school has a proper planned system to administer this medication. If they don't and a child needs these meds, you should make it your responsibility to make sure your child is medicated according to their perscription, instead of trusting a group of people you don't even know.<!-- End Body -->
