<!-- Start Body -->
I want to start off by saying me and a close friend, I will call Z studied this drug for weeks before use. I purchased 100mg of 2c-t-2 from a reliable supplier. Listen everybody I know its dumb so I dont wanna hear shit about me not using a scale peroid. I broke the 100 mg into 5 piles. I capped up two that were roughly 18mg and me and a friend were gonna take em that night (friday).<BR>
<BR>
Heaven 18mg + 3mg insullfated<BR>
<BR>
T 9:45pm- we both ingested the capsules at 9:45. We like we always do smoked weed throughout the entire experience, hoping to enhance the psychedelic effects.<BR>
T 10:45- SLIGHT euphoria, muscle clenching, urges to grind my teeth, its a little uncomfortable. SO far this drug feels like a bunk roll, nothing special. me and Z watch more tv<BR>
T 11:45- Same feelings just a little more pronounced, me and Z decide to take a 3mg bump to put us where we wanna be. I get a little nausious and decide to puke. Within 5 minutes my vision starts swaying back and fourth. Its like everything came alive. My body buzz had doubled, feels like a decent roll now. The ceiling was moving aroung morphing into each other, the carpet is swaying back and fourth. Everything had this clear psychedelic entity around it, my walls were breathing, posters were moving up and down left and right. Colors were just jumping out everywhere, vines were growing all over, neon colors over everything. These hallucinations are more vivid that ANY other hallucinations I have ever recieved. This blows my 6g shroom trip put of the water, and these were BOMB ass shrooms, 2g and your tripping balls almost too hard. <BR>
<BR>
This is the most psychedelic experience ive had so far.. The best part is I can think clearly, When I take shrooms I get the 'mindfuck' which makes it hard to talk and fallow conversations. Not this drug I felt completely clear minded its awesome.<BR>
T 2:00 We have peaked already. The visuals are still there just as pronounced as before, same with body buzz. Ok heres the part NO ONE ever talks about w/ this drug. The Muscle tension, clamping, and teeth grinding. It is VERY annoying and slightly uncomfortable. but well worth the trip. We put in Fear and Loathing. Holy shit, This movie is THE BOMB for this drug. We felt like we were in the movie, I felt like Hunter S. did throughout the whole movie. We smoke weed crack jokes and watch this movie until its over.<BR>
T4:00 The body buzz is back to what I felt at like at 10:30 visuals have subsided, now only slight morphing, melting, and wall breathing. I remember telling Z that I wouldnt sell this feeling for a thousand dollars,lol. Me and Z stay up talk and smoke pot all night<BR>
<BR>
T8:30am- Drug is almost completely gone, but I am sensative to these types of drugs (PEA) and I cant sleep. So I start drinking beer and wine, while smoking green. Within a half hour I was knocked out.<BR>
<BR>
I mean to tell the truth. This is the best drug, well psychedelic that is, that I have ever experienced. The hallucinations so vivid I could sit there w/ pen and paper and draw my hallucinations. I am definately gonna buy more of this.<BR>
<BR>
Ok heres My BAD TRIP report.<BR>
<BR>
Hell ! Everything goes wrong at once !!!!!!!!! 12-15mg insullfated<BR>
<BR>
T 10:45pm - Me and z break out our lines after smoking a few bong bowls, to ease nausia. I do mine up two nostrils. AHHHHAHAHAHA! It fucking burns like no other. I expected this but god damn. Ok bear with me I am going to do alot of writing. I'm just trying to explain the AGONIZING DISPHORIC feeling of 2ct-2 insullfated. within SECONDS I was tripping harder than I have ever in my life. Me and Z are both VIOLENTLY ILL. The cramps, muscle tension, and teeth clenching all hit me at once, AGONIZINGLY INTENSE. This def. was uncomforable and NOT fun. Still I am hallucinating like crazy the entire room is moving, Same visuals I had last night just 10x as intense. The room moving so much is making me more sick. The walls are breathing, patterns, swirls, vines growing are so distinct, its jaw dropping. And the auditory hallucinations were out of this world. Everything sounds metallic, sounds were bouncing off each other. SO MUCH noise in a completely quiet room. It was like in the movies when they try to portray tripping, whenever someone talked it echoed 10 times. <BR>
<BR>
What did I do to myself! It would repeat like 5 times. So when all these things are making noise, the noise would make more and more and more I was going crazy. Anyway back to the shitty part. To go w/ all the body problems my heart is racing at least 120bpm, out of control. I feel like im having a heart attack !!! It becomes hard for me to breath!! BTW Z is feeling the EXACT same feeling I am. We are both having panic atteacks, taking turns going into the bathroom, getting violenly ill, Projectile vomit !!! There was puke EVERYWHERE!!! We were both having such vivid hallucinations we couldnt tell what was puke and what wasnt. I just grabbed a towel and started wiping everything like my life depended on it. it looked like the exorcist was in there. My parents would have flipped. BEAR IN MIND ALL THESE FEELINGS ARE HAPPENING ALL AT ONCE! I was scared for my life. All I could think was what have I done to myself. I feel like I poisoned myself! I kept thinking I was going to die. I looked terrible, we both did. <BR>
<BR>
I know for a fact if anyone would have witnessed what was goin on (mom,dad,hell even a friend) they would have immediately called 911. I wanted to so bad but I knew they couldnt do anything but knock me out, and id get in mass trouble. ME and Z were laying in bed in agonizing pain (unbearable muscle tension, teeth) We just decided to wait it out. If I was still feeling like this in a couple hours I'm calling 911. I knew by how fast it hit us it would be gone just as fast. The only way I can describe it as everything going wrong all at once! I was tripping too Hard, This feels like a psychedelic crack rock, no joke, like I injected the drug.<BR>
<BR>
T12:30 a.m -We are calming down visuals have subsided to the awesome visuals we had the night before, def. not as intense as b4. now I feel like I did at 1:00 a.m. the night before. Good body buzz and visuals audio hallucinations are almost gone. The intensity our bodies had a hour before was gone. I was a little too traumatized to enjoy this any time soon. I was still nervous. Me and Z stay up until 2:30 talking about how fucked up we were and what was happening to us. I blacked out most of the experience of what happened until we talked about it. I couldnt remember what happend just that I was deathly sick and something was very wrong. Eventually after talkin about it was all coming back. We smoke 3 joints right in a row, this calmed me down greatly. <BR>
<BR>
T2:30 My friend is worn out and he gets some sleep. Like I said I have a hard time sleeping on drugs w/ amphetamine like qualities. I stay up and enjoy the rest of the drug before I sleep. This actually feels fun now. I watch TV intill 4:30 then take some shots and pass out.<BR>
<BR>
I cant believe people insullfate this drug, and do as much or more as I did and actually enjoy it. I just dont see anyway possible. THIS DRUG WAS NOT MEANT TO BE SNORTED! please take my word. I feel that I took anymore I might have died. Im SO suprised in the intensity of the drug just by differents routs of administration. I would imagine I.V. wouldnt feel much different. The bad effects lasted for 1 1/2 hours ( to fucked up for my liking). I will definately stick to oral. I think that if anyone I know took this drug the way we did they would have freaked out and went to the hospital. I know that I didnt go because I have tripped HARD b4 and I just wanted to wait it out.<BR>
<BR>
I am posting this to warn people that decide to take T2. I dont care what everyone says, I just want it in the search engine for safety purposes. My friend is goin to post tomarrow about his psychedelic experince when sniffing it. But all I can tell you we both felt exactly the same ! this just wasnt some type of reaction.<BR>
Thank you all<!-- End Body -->
