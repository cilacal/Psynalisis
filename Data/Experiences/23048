Two of my good friends and I were sitting around one night, trying to think of things to do, and since we aren't very imaginative, we immediatly thought, 'What kind of drugs can we do?' So, Steve told us he had AMT, but not a lot of it, only 15 mg for each of us. I enjoy trying different drugs so I said, 'Yes!' Steve and Rob emptied the capsules into small glasses of water and drank it quickly, complaining of a very bitter 'chemical' flavor. After watching them, I decided to empty the pill directly down my throat and chase it with water. I did not taste anything.<BR>
<BR>
We sat around, smoked some pot and waited for it to take effect. I had not eaten anything that day and I can remember being scared that the AMT would make me sick, but it was such a small dose that I think it may have just absorbed into my system faster. It crept up on me within a period of about two hours although I didn't feel the full effects until about an hour after that. <BR>
<BR>
My friends and I decided to get some green tea from a local Chinese restaurant. Walking there was a very pleasant experience, but when we got the tea, I found I didn't really want to put anything else in my stomach because I had no appetite at all. So we just walked back to the house. <BR>
The rest of the night was really nice, I had a mellow trip with pleasant 'feathery' hallucinations. All very natural feeling. I didn't get sick, but I did clench my jaw, and it was sore for the next few days. It lasted a bit long for my taste because I couldn't get to sleep all that night and had a lot of trouble relaxing due to the constant tensing and releasing of my muscles. It was still nice though to have the small waves of hallucinations as I was coming down and the sun was coming up. I remember looking out the window and seeing a bare tree against a rich blue sky. It's leafless branches unfurled and rewound as if there were a fisheye lense moving slowly back and forth among them. <BR>
<BR>
The only thing I didn't really like about AMT was the tiredness. I felt really sluggish for the next few days and I wish I had more time to recoup. But all around I think the small dose was pleasant and facinating.<!-- End Body -->
