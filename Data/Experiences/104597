This is a warning to anyone using or wanting to try branded substances (aka spice, or diablos, or any am-hi-co shit)<br/>
<br/>
Background: I've been interested in drugs starting with weed since age 12. Since then I have experienced LSD, Mushrooms, DXM, Ketamine, MDMA, JWH-018 back when incense blends first became popular as I was trying to avoid pissing positive on a drug test, and in my less proud moments heroin, cocaine, and the am hi co branded DOVES ULTRA.<br/>
<br/>
Set: Good mood. Maybe a bit hungry, albeit not much appetite. Slightly restless due to excitement of trying new blend.<br/>
<br/>
Setting: Saturday afternoon, around 1:00pm, at the apartment with my roommate. Warm day outside. Cute beagle always making his adorableness present.<br/>
<br/>
Material: Black Mamba Incense Blend which claims to be (and very well may be) 5F-AKB-48, an increasingly popular cannabinoid.<br/>
<br/>
T + 0.00: I pack about half a bowl into my glass pipe. Blends always burn real easy so this is consumed in one hit. About 10 seconds into holding my hit, I feel a weird click in my mind that doesn't seem right <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">About 10 seconds into holding my hit, I feel a weird click in my mind that doesn't seem right</div></div>, but I pass it off as just some other weird thing that can be experienced while holding in a toke.<br/>
<br/>
T + 30sec: I come back inside to lie down and wait for the effects to come on. I am almost immediately taken inwards to the new energy building inside of me when I close my eyes. As it gets stronger, like I do with any energy built up in this fashion, I try and use it to solve a couple unknowns I may have lurking around my mind (I know this may be hard to imagine, but I can direct excess mental energies towards things of my choosing, and usually attempting this with the concept of 'unknowns' in my mind provokes the most interesting of responses). This attempt fails miserably in a way I've never experienced before and I immediately turn anxious. EXTREMELY anxious.<br/>
<br/>
T + 45sec: The energy begins to build and build and build almost as if I took a grotesque amount of butylone and I become unbelievably uncomfortably stimmed. I remember trying to get my roommate's attention to let her know I wasn't feeling well, but all I could muster was a look of panicked terror and some grunting noises as the energy overwhelmed and took control of my entire body.<br/>
<br/>
***After this point, story is mixture of what my roommate witnessed, and psychosis***<br/>
<br/>
From here I supposedly ran out onto the balcony and started shrieking my lungs out. This brought neighbors to our apartment door almost immediately, as they thought someone was literally being murdered. I slightly remember coming back inside, looking at everyone with horrible fear (including my dog who is COMPLETELY freaking out) and then going on a rampage of self destruction.<br/>
<br/>
I remember the neighbor looking at me in desperation repeating 'It's OK, I'm here to help! What did you take? What did you take man? It's ok man' but there was nothing that could be done. I remember so badly WANTING to help him help me but there was nothing that could stop what was about to happen.<br/>
<br/>
It was as if there was an energy inside of me that needed to get spent immediatley NO MATTER WHAT and the only things around me were other people and my general apartment furniture. I guess some part of me was forcing myself not to hurt anyone, so I just expelled all the energy onto my surroundings and onto myself.<br/>
<br/>
I picked up a humidifier and smashed it onto my face. I slammed a printer off a desk, picked up an open laptop, and started bashing myself repeatedly in the face with the keyboard. (My roommate is working on her PHD and is lucky to still be able to access the hard drive...). It's almost like I was always off balance, and the only way my body knew how to attempt to regain balance was by smashing about in every direction destroying shit using primarily my face.<br/>
<br/>
Then, I crouched down next to a nightstand, OBLITERATED everything off of the stand with one swoop of the arm, smashed my face on its corner, and proceeded to vomit all over myself and the carpet, repeatedly.<br/>
<br/>
The whole time, I was watching myself do these horrible things and could do nothing to stop it. I was also in an insane psychotic headspace where it felt as if every orifice of my body and mind was being raped and then torn open to be bathed in salt. All I could think was: 'Why am I doing this? What in THE FUCK is happening!?' I was mixed in between the horror I was unleashing on the apartment, and a horrible land of torture in my mind. I imagined myself killing everyone in the apartment, and then being brutally beaten by the police until I was dead. Literally, dead. I experienced this as if it were physically happening. Then I was in a cosmic courtroom where everyone decided that I just wasn't allowed to stop suffering yet. So as punishment I was sentenced thought after thought after thought of what can only be described as mental rape for what seemed to go on for hours.<br/>
<br/>
After I puked, I supposedly sat arms folded around my knees rocking back and forth whimpering 'What the fuck' over and over again. I began to regain coherency by the time the police and EMT showed up at the house, albeit being extremely shellshocked. I was cooperative with them and ended up with no legal issues, but it turns out that after a CT I had a minor Subdural Hematoma (as well as cuts and lacerations over my face) and had to be admitted for the night.<br/>
<br/>
SO HERE IS MY WARNING: Stay the FUCK away from anything with a brand name online. Buying branded chems means you are trusting your life into the hands of someone else's judgement. Even if the actual ingredient listed is the one used, you never know how lazy the chemist felt like being when making a particular batch. In my case, there must have been an unbelievable 'hotspot' in my batch of incense blend due to poor mixing on the sellers end, and there is no telling just how much I actually ingested in that one large hit. If you want to test the waters of these less heard of chems, BE SMART. Buy a mg scale and the powder yourself, and always allergy test whatever you purchase to ensure it isn't mislabeled. Get vials to place your things in light-free temperature controlled environments, and always have a trip sitter when exploring new substances.<br/>
<br/>
