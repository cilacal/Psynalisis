      It was the July 22 of the year 2000.  I was just completing my three day vacation to Block Island, RI.  I was to board a train  in the town of Kingston, RI bound for Albany, NY (my place of residence).  Upon arrival to the train station, I bought a 20 oz bottle of Pepsi and retrieved an ice cream cone shaped paper cup from the water fountain.  I had roughly 125mg of 5-meo-dipt inside a mylar packet.  I filled the ice cream cone shaped paper cup halfway with Pepsi then added what appeared to be 15-20mg of 5-meo-dipt (found out later to be 40mg because the material left was weighed out to be 85mg).  I stirred to solution and added more pepsi on top.  <BR>
<BR>
9:30 AM (+0:00) The soltuion was ingested and didn't taste all that bad until the bottom of the cone was reached and I gagged.  <BR>
<BR>
10:00 AM (+0:30) First hints of something beginning to happen.  I felt an enegy roaming through my body.  My vision became much clearer as I could see each and every individual leaf in a tree not too far away.  People begin to become more 'character like.'  I began to laugh to myself.<BR>
<BR>
10:20 AM (+0:50) Nausea begins as I continue to drink what was left of my 20 oz. Pepsi.  The taste of the Pepsi reminded me of the chemical I had gagged previously and that made the nausea even worse.<BR>
<BR>
10:40 AM (+1:10) I walk around the train station trying to settle my stomach.  It just makes me feel more nauseous, so I settle down leaning against the fence near the platform. Paranoia begins to settle in and the visual aspects of foxy begin to make themselves more apparent.<BR>
<BR>
11:00 AM (+1:30)  'Where the hell is my train?'  I ask myself.  Then all of a sudden I hear my name announced on the loudspeaker saying I had to come to the ticket office.  I thought to myself, 'Is this a hallucination, how did they know my name?'  I made my way to the ticket desk and talked to the guy at the ticket desk and he told me my train was going to be late and that I would miss my connecting train.  He then told me he was going to send me in a cab to Worcester, MA which was over 2 hours away, where I would catch my train to Albany from there.<BR>
<BR>
11:10 AM (+1:40)  I sat outside the train station to wait for my cab. My nausea had disappeared and the psychedelic effects were more present.  Similar to 50mcg LSD for a first timer.  I was very open and talkative to people which normally I wouldn't be.  Soon, my cab came and I was on my way.  <BR>
<BR>
11:30 AM (+2:00)  Nausea returns with a vengeance as the cab driver lights up a cigarette.  Him and I discussed nictoine addiction.  I asked him what brand he smoked and he repiled 'Basic. Yeh Basic Shit.' Which I found humorous.<BR>
<BR>
1:30 PM (+4:00)  Everytime I did foxy my buzz was mostly over at the 4 hour mark.  But, this time I was going strong along with my nausea.  At one point I thought I was gonna hurl in the back of the cab but I didn't fortunately.  I arrived at the Amtrak station in Worcester, MA.  I thought about the fire fighters who had died in this city here.<BR>
<BR>
1:50 PM (+4:20) Ironically, I really felt like smoking some marijuana to ease my nausea.  All of a sudden, this latino guy sitting next to me asked me if I had a lighter and I did.  So he asked me if I wanted to go smoke a cigarette, so I obliged and went outside just to chat with him and his friends.  Outside, he says 'Yo, man do you smoke? We're gonna go smoke a blunt.'  This was a sign from heaven.<BR>
<BR>
2:00 PM (+4:30)  We chatted and smoked a nice blunt for a while and the 5-meo-dipt returned with full force.  And as for my nausea, it was gone for good.  We returned to the train station and I felt kinda paranoid in the train station like all these people knew.  The top of my spine tingled, my senses were all multiplied, and there was so much energy bursting out of my solar plexus.  I had so much energy, I didn't know what to do with it.  <BR>
<BR>
3:20 PM (+5:50)  I said good bye to my marijuana supplying friends and boarded my train headed for Albany, NY.  I stared out the window, grinning for a while noting all the tryptamine brightness of the landscape outside my window.  And soon I fell asleep and woke up not far from my final destination.<!-- End Body -->
