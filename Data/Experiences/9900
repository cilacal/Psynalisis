After three days of tripping, first on LSD, then 5meoDMT and MDMA, then a particularly gruelling Psilocybin trip, I was a little hesitant to do any drugs this particular night.  My mindset was still kind of wobbly from my very first freak out the night before.  But after talking to a close friend who had been part of my negative experience the previous evening, we thought maybe I could rewrite my head if I was uber cautious and took a low dose.  After all, it was Burningman, and there were four nights left.  I consulted with two more trusted friends and decided I’d be damned if I let some little mushrooms ruin my week.  So off I went.<BR>
<BR>
Initially it was supposed to be a small group of maybe five of my close friends.  As the time came closer to dosing, the number steadily grew to about ten, and I was already wary.  After putting up a bit of hesitation my friend promised that if things were rough, we’d just split off.  So finally, after about an hour of the delays that automatically come with any large group of people attempting to use drugs, we dosed.<BR>
<BR>
The ramp up was slow.  We took off across the playa on a demented voyage led by our fearless ground control in Bunny Ears.  While Bunny was the sober one in the group, it was her first night out seeing the sights after being sick all week. It soon became clear that she was even more hell bent on having a good time than I was.<BR>
<BR>
As we tramped across the desert, we soon started to be distracted by whatever glowed brightest in the distance.  We came across a flaming double helix that people were dancing around.  While most of us stood back, Bunny Ears jumped right in, lifting up her skirt and prancing around.  Needless to say, we were all mesmerized.<BR>
<BR>
The night wore on and Bunny went on to face off with a DPW truck, go for a double round on the pneumatic spanking machine, rid the world of evil monkeys with her glowing cheerleader baton, and perform a strip tease on the Alien Love Nest stage.  She also managed to work us in a continuous loop around Black Rock City just in time for those who were tired (herself included) to drop off, and the two of us who had had only a mildy shimmery experience to go “hey!  Why aren’t we that high?”  So we decided to boost (roughly four hours after the initial dose).  One of our companions had a powerful initial experience, but decided to boost with us in an attempt to “keep up.”  <BR>
<BR>
The three of us trudged on with another friend we picked up along the way, and one of the non-boosting members of our original group and found ourselves at Spectator Camp.  Sweet sweet spectator camp.  The five of us sat there for a few hours heckling people, demanding gifts, and asking them for various drugs we really had no desire for.  I definitely became much more giddy at this point, but still wasn’t tripping very hard.  We scored a vial of tequila and a beer from a chance encounter with my friend’s ex girlfriend who hates me for chasing her off when they were dating and she was trying to upstage me on the show we were working on.  I guess there’s no bad blood.<BR>
<BR>
After spectator camp, we randomly wound up in a few bizarre nightclubish places, then headed back to camp.  We lost the two who hadn’t boosted with us to sleep, but picked up another friend of ours we had lost in the desert earlier in the evening and decided to go do some nitrous.  So, lying in the back of a bus in broad daylight, hiding from our friends for fear they’d want some of the precious nitrous, we sat and giggled.   Lost our straggler to sleep after round two of the cracker and cackled over the fact that it meant more for us.  Another friend arrived as we were finishing the nitrous and offered to cook us pancakes.  Life was good.  <BR>
<BR>
However, the sun was well up, and we would need to sleep at some point, but none of us were tired.  We decided it was a time for drastic action, and broke out a bottle of port and a bottle of bourbon and started hitting the sauce.  At this point, the nitrous had wiped any memory of the 2ci, and the booze wiped out the nitrous.  Finally, all our friends were awake, and we sat down to talk to them in a nearby tent.  I woke up on the floor of the tent a while later, my friends had left me, and so I scurried back to my van to rest.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, I’d say it was an effective way to rewire my brain for the week.  The next three nights were phenomenal.  This trip was enjoyable, light, giddy, but not nearly as colorful as I’d hoped for, or as most of my other companions seemed to achieve.  Next time I’d start at 24.<!-- End Body -->
