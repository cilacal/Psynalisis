This trip report does not concern me so much as it does my friend.  <BR>
<BR>
 Well... I've been tripping for a good couple of years now, I've eaten everything from your standard LSD and Mushrooms to your more eclectic DOB, 2C-B, and AMT, along with a whole range of currently-legal research chemicals.<BR>
<BR>
My latest dabbling has been 2C-E and 5-meo-mipt. My girlfriend and I have been eating 2C-E at varying doses (highest so far is about 50mg each) every weekend for the past couple of weeks. As I went through a gram quite fast, the majority of it gone in two weeks, I decided to have a small trip party with the last 5 hits, along with a large quantity of 2C-I and 5-MeO-MiPT that I had.<BR>
<BR>
The setting is my grandparents house, as they are out of the country for quite a while and condone of my using their house for small parties so long as I clean up. The people are my girlfriend K, friends J (male), T (male), P (male) and E (female) who are currently dating, and myself.<BR>
<BR>
Around 5:00 we all take our doses. My girlfriend and I eat one capsule (about 25mg) of 2C-E each with the plans on smoking some 5-MeO-MiPT as we were coming up. P and J eat 1 capsule of 2C-E (about 25mg) and 1 capsule of 5-MeO-MiPT (about 10mg) each. E and T just plan on drinking.<BR>
<BR>
About two hours after we dose, neither my girlfriend and I are feeling it at all.  We had tripped the night before on 5-MeO-MiPT and not gotten much sleep, probably resulting in a cross-tollerance.  P and J, however, are feeling it quite strong, while E and T are both quite drunk. As we were low on supplies, E lets me take her car to the grocery store to get some supplies. It was a quick trip, we got some drinks and some snack foods and head back. When we return, K, J, T and I lounge around the living room while E and P are in the guest bedroom presumably fooling around. We're sitting around talking when all of the sudden P decides to come out of the room butt naked. He says 'what's up' then falls onto the floor behind the couch that K and I were sitting on. We all bust out laughing at his fucked-up-ness, and head outside so we can laugh some more but not in front of him, as he was obviously tripping fairly hard.<BR>
<BR>
So, we're sitting in the backyard lounging around while P and E were back in the guest bedroom. About 15 minutes after the first incident of him coming out naked, we hear E scream. It didn't sound like it was in pain or fear, so none of us did anything. Then, about a minute later, she ran outside in tears saying that P was really fucked up and that he bit her and wouldn't let her leave the room.<BR>
<BR>
So, out of the group, my girlfriend and I are the only 'sober' ones. We had taken some 2C-E but neither of us felt it. My other friend J was tripping pretty hard and had no idea what to do. So, K calmed down E while T and I went inside to see what the hell was up. P comes out of the room again, still butt naked, this time stroking his limp dick and saying stuff like 'I FEEL SO GOOD!' 'THE TREES ARE GREEN' 'BABY I'LL DO ANYTHING FOR YOU SWIM IN THE CREEK DO COKE I'LL DO ANYTHING' 'ENGINEERS, BUILDING BETTER BRIDGES' 'I WANT TO FUCK YOU E' 'I WANT TO PUT MY DICK IN YOUR ASS'..... and so on... basically he would repeat the same couple sentences over and over while beating off his limp dick.<BR>
<BR>
T and I look at each other and say 'what the fuck do we do?' when all of the sudden he punches me in the face. I don't know why I didn't lose it.... I had a PVC didgeridoo in my hands that I could have easily killed him with on the spot, but I kept my composure and went outside, knowing full well that he was beyond fucked up. The next hour or so is spent with him wandering in and out of the house, wanting his girlfriend E or to go swimming in the 'creek' (I still have no idea what he means by this). He shouts stuff like 'FUCK YOU!' 'I WANT TO FUCK YOU IN THE ASS' 'FUCK ALL OF Y'ALL' 'I DON'T CARE!' over and over again, while I can hear my neighbors entering and leaving their backyards.<BR>
<BR>
I'm freaking out that someone is going to call the cops, so I put all the drugs into a CD case and stash it in a hiding spot in a nearby friendly house. Heading back, he's still up to the same crap. He was having a full blown shit-flip, one of sizes I've never seen before. I've seen people lose their minds and wander around the house for a couple hours, or getting stuck on the couch watching TV unable to speak, but I've never seen someone so far blown as P. It was as if he didn't know where he was, when he was, who anyone else was, or what he was doing.<BR>
<BR>
We're still trying to figure out what to do and call up some people seeing if they could help in any way. Finally, one friend says he has some sleeping pills and will bring them on by. It's been about an hour, hour and a half or so since this whole thing begun and he was still doing the same shit. This time he was just standing in the living room beating off saying the same stuff with T watching him, J in the kitchen, K and E in the back room with me in there making some phone calls. Finally, E convinces him to go lay down in a bed. He remains there under the covers until my friend comes with the sleeping pills. He gives me two, saying that half of one is enough. He can't stay long though, and departs fairly quickly.<BR>
<BR>
So, now we're left with P who is tripping harder than I ever imagined possible, and all of us with two sleeping pills wondering how we'll feed them to him. According to the friend that gave them to me, they tasted kind of sugary, so we decided to crush them up and pour them into a shot of vodka. We hand him the shot, telling him that it's more 2C-E and that it will fuck him up even more. He says 'fuck yeah!' and takes it out of my hand. Instead of drinking it, however, he poured it on himself.<BR>
<BR>
So, one pill wasted, one left to go, E decides to try to coerce him to take it. She, being his girlfriend, sweet talks him, telling him that it's more 2C-E and that he'll feel even better. She lets her put it in his mouth and drinks some water that she handed to him, swallowing the pill.<BR>
<BR>
Victory! Sort of....<BR>
<BR>
It took a good hour or so to kick in, and it never fully worked. Instead of knocking him out, it more or less just sedated him. He was still beyond fucked up, but at least he wasn't shouting. He would occasionally mumble to himself, all the while still beating off his limp pecker completely butt naked on my grandparents bed. E feels really bad for him and spends most of her time in the room talking to him, against our advice of simply leaving him alone. It's now about 10:30 or 11:00 or so, and none of us are sure what to do with him.<BR>
<BR>
So... for the next few hours we just sort of hang around the living room. K, J and I slip off to an adjacent room to watch some TV while E and T listen to some music. P is under control for now, so we just decide to wait and see what happens.<BR>
<BR>
Finally, the situation gets to be too much for my girlfriend. She's a psychedelic hard head, easily matching my doses, yet is still fairly new to the scene; she's never seen a full-blown shit flip, and it gets to her. Even though neither of us even began to trip (tollerance + the situation most likely), she was feeling a bit nauceous. She wants to head home, so I take her there.<BR>
<BR>
After I dropped her off, I came back to an empty house. P, E, J, and T were gone. I called up T to see what happened and he said that J needed to leave and that they were going to drop P off at his home. Apparently they believed he was still monumentally fucked up, yet coherent enough to be back at his house.<BR>
<BR>
So, while they were gone I cleaned up the house, and they returned. We sit around for a while, recounting the night, still entirely in shellshock, and they decide to crash. I'm still up and wired, so I head back over to my girlfriends house for an hour or two.<BR>
<BR>
And now.. here I sit writing this. It's 4:40am and I'm not feeling the least bit tired. T and E are going to leave the house around 9am, so I'll head over there shortly after to do one final clean and lock up.<BR>
<BR>
As for P.... I have no idea how he's doing now. He's at home as far as I know and care. I've seen a side of him that I never knew could even exist in a person, and it will permanently affect how I look at him. I feel anger for him and yet a great amount of sorrow. Tomorrow he won't remember a bit of what happened, yet his life is quite a bit different now. He did some things that he will really regret, I don't how he's going to live it down.<BR>
<BR>
The thing that confuses me the most is just how the fuck this happened? He's tripped before, off mushrooms a couple times, acid once, and 2C-E once. I've never actually tripped with him before but I've talked to him a number of times over the phone while tripping and he never lost it this bad. This took us all completely by suprise. His dosage of the drugs was no higher than anyone elses; it was well under the scope of a shit-flip of the magnitude had. Was it just... bad timing? The combination of a phenethylamine and tryptamine? What could have triggered this?<BR>
<BR>
[edit]<BR>
<BR>
It's now the Monday after, and I've seen and talked to P.  He doesn't remember a good 5 or 6 hours of the night and apologized profusely when we told him what happened.  He's encouraging me to write this report so that others can understand that sometimes the unexpected does happen.  There's really no way to prepare for it except to just keep some sleeping pills or thorazine on you; the best advise I can give is not to freak out.  Stay calm and collected, don't yell or try to control the person that's tripping too hard because he'll only yell louder.<BR>
<BR>
I hope this trip report can prevent other similar incidents from occuring in the future.<!-- End Body -->
