This report is about my most recent relapse on opoids, in this case, an off brand 80mg 'oxycontin' it was not the abnormally shaped generic that isn't easily injectable, it was the same shape and color as a name brand 80mg Oxycontin, but instead of 'OC' it had three letters, starting with an A as I recall.  I was told it was a Canadian brand.  It should be noted that I have quite a high tolerance to opoids and benzodiazepines (Xanax).  When I was actively addicted to opoids (about 8 months), when I could afford to do as much opoids as I wanted, I would usually do a dangerous amount.  I would either snort up to 240mg of oxycontin in a day, smoke up to 22.5 mg of fentanyl in a day, drink up to 150mg of liquid methadone, or snort up to half a gram of high quality black tar heroin.  A month after I had quit opoids, I ate 18mg of Clonazepam and a few beers, I went swimming in the lake for a while with no problems, then came back inside and went into a completely amnesiac stupor for about 16 hours, and a very amnesiac for the next 10 days, ( I wrecked my car 3 days later from the residual effects).  Now onto the fun.<br/>
<br/>
Wednesday afternoon, Decemebr 15th I believe, I had about 4-5 grams of Grade-A Cannabis, I had already taken my daily 150mg Effexor XR (venlafaxine) capsule.  I hadn't taken any opoids in about 4 months.  Not feeling sufficiently sedated, I went to my Xanax (alprazolam) dealer's house.  I purchased 10 2mg bars for 50 dollars.  I immediately snorted 4mg.  This was around 4 or 5 o'clock  The rest of the following day (and to a lesser degree the following month) was pretty hazy.  over the next few hours, I ate and snorted 8 of the 2mg bars, of course I originally assumed I had done all 10 bars, as the next day I couldn't find any (I found the other 2 on my floor several days later).  By my best estimates, it was around 8 or 9 o'clock when I went to my local sex shop to purchase 3 cases (72 cartridges or nitrous oxide).  I probably did about 12 on my 10 minute ride home.  I did the rest in about an hour.  <br/>
<br/>
So it's around 10? or 11? o'clock, really no way to know, when I decided that the MASSIVE amount of Xanax I had consumed was not enough to quiet my hunger for opiates, I called my connection, and asked if he could help me out, he told me he could get me an 80mg Ocycontin for 45$, I told him all I had was 40, and that I would make it up with Cannabis, he reluctantly agreed.  I drove over to his house  <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> , QUITE fucked up from the Xanax, I made it there without serious incident, thoguh it took me a long while to find his house.  Now normally when I used opiates, I didn't shoot up, I had only done it a few times in the past, and wasn't crazy about it, as I usually had the money to make it unnecessary.  But that was not the case this time.  As I hurried inside, I was already removing my jacket and shirt, one of my junkie pals recognized my desire and went to retrieve his syringe.  Up until this point, I had only used brand new, self purchased needles, for fear of disease, but at the time, I didn't give a fuck, I told him to rinse it out and get it ready, about that time, not feeling very patient, I had had 40mg of the pill broken down into a line, which I snorted.  <br/>
<br/>
Very high now, relaxed, in total control, happy.  A few minutes later, he had another 20mg ready in the rig.  I sat down on the floor, he found my mainline registered a beautiful red bloom of passion, and drove it home, I fell back almost as quickly as he could remove the works, I was probably higher than I had ever been, but I honestly don't remember.  The next thing I remember was waking up on the floor with blankets over me, I asked my friend when I got the blankets, he said he put them on me, cause I looked extremely cold and was breathing shallow, he seemed pretty pissed, and said I'd better handle my shit or leave.  I told him I was fine, and to put my last 20mg in the rig, which he suppsedly did.  I know I had 2 injection sites from the night, and I was pretty sure I remembered the second shot, but thinking back, it makes no sense that one of them wouldnt have done the 20mg I left out, but he put something in my arm. oh well.  at about 5 in the morning, my friend woek me up and told me he needed a ride to work, I was barely conscious, and almost out of gas, but I reluctantly agreed, on the way there, I ran out of gas, and we had to wait for his coworker to meet us.  <br/>
<br/>
Well, long story short, I've been clean about a month, and I would kill for some Tar about right now, and seeing as I have 20$ in my pocket, I just may go listening for the siren's song.<!-- End Body -->
