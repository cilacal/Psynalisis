Some friends of mine had been discussing the widely unknown field of legal or somewhat legal psychedelic substances in the united states. Alpha-methyltryptamine (AMT) is something we all found interesting and one of my companions acquired one gram of the substance. Although I encouraged him to find and use a scale, every dose in that gram had been eyeballed, which is why I am unsure of the exact dosage I took.<br>
<br>
 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span> <br>
<br>
My mood over a couple of days had been generally depressed and I made sure to wait til I felt back to normal before I tried this. As I decided I would be taking my dose the next day, I made sure not to eat a big meal before bed, and nothing upon waking up. Around two hours after i woke up, at 11am, I washed down around thirty to forty milligrams of AMT with apple juice. <br>
<br>
I knew it would be a while before effects really set in, based on what friends and online trip reports had told me. The first effects were barely being felt around 40 minutes to an hour after ingestion, and by 12:30 (+90 minutes) I was definately feeling similar to the feeling of having just eaten an ecstasy pill, warm body buzz and slightly empathatic. The come-up was so gradual, more than any drug I've known. The MDMA-like feeling built up slowly (but never climaxed to the exact feeling of MDMA intoxication) until around 2:30 or 3pm. The difference between these feelings were that I never felt as.. lazy as while rolling, or as extremely empathic or indulgent.<br>
<br>
Around 3 o'clock we smoked, between 7 people, two marijuana joints about the lenghth of a standard cigarette and about a half inch thick each. This definately intensified the body buzz I was having, although for a little bit right after we smoked I would keep forgetting that I had taken AMT, although I was definately feeling different than any other time. At this time I also started receiving some closed-eye visuals, which would increase as time went by.<br>
<br>
Throughout this entire time I had been drinking lots of water, and I was taking a sip around one point and a realization just hit me suddenly. It was about Water and Life. Water is the basis of all life as we know it, and life cannot be sustained without it in some form or degree. Constantly do we drink or use Water and not think a thing of it, but when we drink Water, we are drinking Life. This was very profound to me.<br>
<br>
It was around 4 o'clock or so when we smoked a little more pot, I only took 2-3 hits. Afterward we were on my front porch having a cigarette, on this sunny winter day. I was looking at the sky and the brightness of the sun, and the sun appeared to have these transparent pedals around, like that of a flower, except they overlapped on top of everything. I was about to mention how pretty it was when it hit me like a freight train, so clearly, that I was being shown the second element: the Sun, the Light it produces, and the Heat it turns into. Without this all, we there would be no Heat and everything would cease to move as it reaches absolute zero. In an environment such as this there would not be any sustaining Life. This was the second element, and I was so excited in seeing this.<br>
<br>
By this point I was definately intoxicated, although very awake I would want to lay down or sit, keep my eyes closed even when I was talking (very talkative, by the way), and my speech would be slightly slurred. <br>
<br>
By 8 o'clock I had definately begun to see some mild open-eyed visuals, even though the physical and intoxicated feeling I had seemed to begin to wear off. I wasn't too worried about feeling like I was coming down, I assumed it would be at least as gradual as the come-up. Around 10pm or so things were definately winding down a little, but then we smoked a decent amount of marijuana, and I began at once to feel like I had a couple hours previous. We had been sitting on a circle at my friends' apartment, and I was watching two of my friends holding hands, and how their fingers would move, and the feelings that that represented, and I realized the third element: Love. All Life and everything that happens exists, in one way or another with Love. This was very beautiful to me and I recorded the elements of Life in my friend's notebook.<br>
<br>
Throughout the next 3-4 hours we smoked a little more marijuana, and the effects gradually began to wear off. By 1-2am I was feeling sleepy, and we went to bed around 4am.<br>
<br>
Throughout the entire duration, I felt very uplifted mentally and spiritually. I am very interested in trying this again at a higher dose, although I feel cautious as it is a research chemical.<!-- End Body -->
