07:10pm - 4mg 2C-I straight / sublingual<BR>
<BR>
07:30pm - 4mg 2C-I Gelcap<BR>
<BR>
07:45pm - initial waviness<BR>
<BR>
08:10pm - 1st 'yeah, I'm there' color enhancement. Cowgirl in front of me shaking her hips, her bikini top became bright red & her tan skin looks sooo good<BR>
<BR>
09:00pm - puffed brought it out. no real headspace...a plastic 3D effect to all things colorful...buzzing subdermal energy<BR>
<BR>
09:50pm - strong shroom-like breathing, anesthetic numbness in extremeties...good immediate antidepressant effect - no desire...just want to experience clean, pure trip...i turn down nugget cause all i want is this, untainted...i feel as if i could go the rest of my life without desire...no alcohol, no cigarettes, no weed, i don't even care about sex, i feel 'fixed' somehow, as if all my bad habits just whisked away & replaced with an alertness & awareness I haven't felt for awhile. I've noticed the phenethylamines tend to pull me out of the drug haze of other recreationals & kind of 'put you IN life.'<BR>
<BR>
This is what it feels like to be ALIVE, experiencing the moment yet completely aware of your environment. The tryptamines can put me in the moment, but I also tend to lose myself in the psychedelic mindspace created by the breakthough. At this level it is like having one foot in the tryptamine reality & the other in linear reality.<BR>
<BR>
10:20pm - Stretching a lot in between dancing. Working the muscles, healing, twisting the energy throughout my arms and legs. Wringing out stress. Some jaw fluttering every now & then, drinking lots of water, staying hydrated. Not too much visual activity up close, but peripheral breathing when zooming out to a panorama.<BR>
<BR>
There seems to be some effect on innerocular pressure, it feels kind of weird. Falling in love a lot, lots of passion. Just passion though, still no desire/lust. I want to wrap my arms around this girl and just hold her, it's not like I'm running around with a raging boner. In fact, right now I don't even think I COULD have sex if I did desire but I could definetely be very very passionate.<BR>
<BR>
Every once in a while I'll feel a twinge in the lower back, nothing major but I'm aware of it so I wouldn't mix any known hepatoxins with it during the duration or put any excess stress on the kidneys, just to be safe. I had a moment when walking to the bathroom after dancing really hard where I experienced a jolt around the heart that made me pause to catch my breath. It's happened before without drugs & I attribute this instance to overexertion. It's hot, I'm high, and I just danced my ass off.<BR>
<BR>
12:15am - Back @ home base: Early curfew means we get back here in time for LT. Hungry, getting some grub, channel surfing...Lots of stuff is really funny now. Giggling & laughing so hard it hurts sometimes. Contemplating just chilling in the AC & skipping the show since it'll soon be over. Nah, fuck it, gotta be social.<BR>
<BR>
01:30am - I'm pretty much down now, almost no visual activity, the body rush has faded considerably. I have a cider at the bar even though i really don't want alcohol still. Run into a lot of kids I haven't seen since my club days, like 9 years ago. They all look exactly the same & are still dressing exactly the same & I am this completely reborn spiritual entity...I definetely have evolved since those days, I'm not the man they once knew although I am still 'me.' LT is fucking ROCKiN', I'm having an easier time getting my groove on now. <BR>
<BR>
The energy is working synergistically with the residual chemical, but still I think 2C-T-2 is better for that kind of work, this is primarily recreational: a buzz. I was having a really difficult time during some parts of the previous show working with energy, it wasn't flowing to the surface as easily as I was expecting it to, I was used to T2 where by the third hour I am a bright luminous being shooting threads of energy from every pore. This isn't it. It's light, easy. My grandmother could handle an afternoon on this chem at this level & have a great time. Although it feels like a sanitised psychedelic experience, I still don't really trust the phenethylamines too much until neurotoxicity studies are done.<BR>
<BR>
02:00am - last call, so the party must move...be back in a few hours for some final thoughts<BR>
<BR>
06:00am - I have since post-loaded with 5-HTP, which did bring the 2C-I back slightly once it started working. I've also been puffing to try to hold onto the experience as long as possible. I turned on the TV & Alice Through The Looking Glass is on. *teehee* 8) Kate Beckinsale is so fucking adorable, I could spend an eternity lost in her eyes. The movie this time around is a lot more funny whereas watching it with Daisy on foxy was just insane. <BR>
<BR>
I definetely prefer it on a tryptamine over a phenethylamine, it should be a mind fuck. Nevertheless, I find myself crying at the end during the final quote zoom out/fade out. Absolutely beautiful. But I digress, back to chemical observations. It's probably a good thing this chem is primarily isolated right now to a very small core of people in this society. <BR>
<BR>
If it leaked into the recreational drug masses like ecstasy did, I could see a definite abuse potential simply because it's so easy & light compared to what we've been raised on. People would be tempted to bump up or eat more. If I didn't know as much about the known pharmacology of the phenethylamines (primarily the roles of serotonin & dopamine) as I do I would be tempted to take more to try to go back up. All-in-all it's a fun & interesting chemical and I feel blessed to be able to feel it & ponder it's methods & implications, but I don't think I'll miss it when it's gone.<!-- End Body -->
