The first time I did 2cb I tried 25mg as my friend did 15mg and said it was good but i thought I had a high tolerance to shrooms so I tried more, poped the capsule of 25mg and sat around for a bit. I got a few swirls here an there but I was mostly bored around 2.5 hours I got fed up and went to sleep (slept a good 10 hours and felt fine).<br>
<br>
About 2 months later he got some more so i decided to try it again this time I did 35 mg and sat around with no expectations. I just let it do its job, my friends girlfriend couldn't finish her beer so I guzzled 1/2 of it for her because she was tanked already so I continue just to sit and watch the movie that was on and then it starts kicking in and we decide to go outside. <br>
<br>
This is where it gets interesting, we're outside in a gazeboe and Im just TRIPPIN HARD LOVIN EVERY MIN, swirls, colors, AMAZING. Then the best thing in the world happens. It started to snow and everything looked so nice I layed down on the lawn looking up just absorbing it all. I started to get some gassyness and my muscles got kind of tight (well they were before it just got worse) and I started shaking. I had one big burp and in the middle of it I puked what looked like a bunch of maggots and rotting carcass out, for some reason I couldnt stop laughing I thought it was so neat! and then I puked 2 more time but it was all water. <br>
<br>
IWent inside and drank some gatorade which tasted AMAZING might I add. After the Puking was over I felt great the the next 3-4 hours, such a good trip I'd do it again.<br>
<br>
The next moring I woke up with a bit of a headache, and poped 1 tylenol took a shower and felt perfectly normal.<!-- End Body -->
