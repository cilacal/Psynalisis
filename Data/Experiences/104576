The following describes a bad experience I had with NBOMes during my mid teens.<br/>
<br/>
When I was 15 I was friends with the type of people who like to use and sell drugs, one of which gave me two tabs of N bombs. Which I then decided to take in my room at around 9pm. I'd made some preparations beforehand such as filling empty bottles with water in case I got thirsty, I had zero intention of walking downstairs to my kitchen for a glass of water whilst tripping on what is effectively acid, and also turning on the lava lamps and laser lights in my room to increase the effect. <br/>
<br/>
Anyway , around 9 o'clock I put both tabs under my gum as the dealer instructed. I didn't feel anything immediately other than an unpleasant chemical taste. After being on my iPad for around half an hour it started to kick in. I put down my iPad and stared into my carpet. My carpet was green ( not due to the effects of the drug, I just had a green carpet, it wasn't my choice ) and has very small knots on it. As I stared into it ( I was lying next to it rather than stood up staring down at it ) the knots that it was made out of seemed to climb over each other, as one knot disappeared into the carpet another climbed over it as it sank. I found the effect quite incredible as I'd never done a drug like this before. <br/>
<br/>
However, as I enjoyed watching the knots of my green carpet climb and roll over each other they soon morphed into miniature creatures. They were a darker green and had between 6 and 8 legs that crawled over each other. It looked as if the floor of my bedroom was an inch thick in disgusting insects. <br/>
<br/>
It was at this point where it continued down hill, I tried escaping my floor into my bed but as I pulled back the duvet I saw an infestation of bugs underneath it. All seeming to separate because of the shock of pulling back my duvet. <br/>
<br/>
I tried to calm myself down by singing a song I knew that I believe is by pink floyd however I sang the same 4 noted riff over and over repeatedly whilst being very anxious about calming myself down and the fact it clearly didn't work. <br/>
<br/>
Despite my attempts the bugs were now all over, therefore as any right-minded person would do I made my way to my shower to get the imaginary bugs off me. When I tried to get in the shower it looked as if the walls were also infested with huge black insects. Whether or not you're scared of bugs ( I myself wasn't ) and however unscary the idea of seeing bugs seems to you, this was the single most scary experience of my life so far, even in hindsight. <br/>
<br/>
After leaving my bathroom I apparently made quite a racket in my house which gained the attention of my parents and also my older sister. They could tell there was something wrong with me because I was probably repeating the same action over and over. Anyway I was driven to the hospital by my father ( I don't remember anything past the shower, this is all my parents' recollection ). <br/>
<br/>
The story continues the next day, which  I can remember. I woke up lying in a hospital bed, looking at the ceiling which appeared to be 'breathing' in and out, whilst from an air vent it blew rainbow coloured bubbles out. My bad trip due to overdose ( two tabs rather then one ) had stopped but I hadn't stopped tripping. After being in hospital for about three days I was eventually discharged. <br/>
<br/>
However the consequences of the mistake of doing the drug didn't end there. I now have a form of delusional parasitosis and have to sleep with the lights on if I intend on getting any sleep at all.<br/>
   <br/>
My advice to anyone considering nbomes or similar drugs is don't. The high isn't worth the risk. <br/>
<br/>
