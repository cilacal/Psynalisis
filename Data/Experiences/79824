I am an experienced user of psychadelics, benzodiazepines, and other possibly relevant psychotropic drugs. In particular, I've had the pleasure of 6 experiences with 2C-E and I've used Valium countless times for various reasons.<br/>
<br/>
The 5th experience I had with 2C-E was an oral dose of 15mg. I was off baseline at an hour and tripped nicely. Although there were many things within the trip I could expand upon in this report, I can easily summarize it by saying that I had interesting visuals and thoughts concurrent with many other reports involving 2C-E. Around the 8 hour mark, I realized that I was very tired but unable to sleep due to constant mental stimulation from the comedown of the trip. I then ingested 15mg of diazepam, hoping to utilize this heavy dose as a sleeping pill of sorts. I allowed one of the 3 Valiums to dissolve under my tongue before swallowing the oily slightly bitter sediment down, a sparse habit of mine when taking this particular orange pill. Typically, I find that diazepam kicks in fully before an hour's time.<br/>
<br/>
After 1.5 hours, I was certain that I was feeling no significant effects from the diazepam at ALL. I felt none of the normal comfort, relaxation, and safety that I often find in benzodiazepines. Smoking cigarettes made me feel much better, a characteristic of taking Valium. I still felt stimulated, not relaxed, though by the 13th hour of the entire experience (5 hours after ingesting the diazepam). At some unknown point after this I drifted off into complete unconsciousness, and slept for approximately 13 hours. I awoke feeling somewhat groggy and uncoordinated, but this cleared up within 10 minutes of waking.<br/>
<br/>
The experience wasn't particularly bad, it was just surprising to feel practically none of the benefits I normally expect. However, I would not take diazepam again on 2C-E, since I feel there is a complete dis-synergy between the two drugs in terms of effect.<!-- End Body -->
