My first JWH-018 experience (with virtually NO prior drug experience) included some fun details, and an absolutely amazing sexual experience, but it was sometimes difficult for me to identify the line between reality and drug-induced fantasy, and I felt slightly out of control at times.  3-4 hours after ingestion, I was asleep.  The next day, I decided that my next trip needed to have a slightly lower dose to avoid those last two factors, but I was looking forward to trying it again.<br>
<br>
Last night, I tried again.  After slipping 6-8 mg under my tongue, I went about my normal evening with my wife.  Two hours later (this is when the effects hit on my first time), I was disappointed that I could feel something, but very little.  I thought I had too small a dose this time.<br>
<br>
An hour later, though, the effects started building. Incoming stimuli from all senses were delayed, and a generally good feeling was clearly present.  Events and input began to have a 'repetition' effect.  It was a bit like deja vu, only immediate, as though every sight, sound or feeling had aftershocks.  Everything was amplified, or intensified, or exaggerated. I decided this was a perfect time to have sex, and my wife and I began cuddling on the couch.<br>
<br>
About 3 1/2 hours after ingestion, she lowered her head to give me a blowjob.  Without too much detail, every feeling was intensified, and reverberated inside me.  It. Was.  FABULOUS.  Not nearly as intense as my first experience (in which the highlight was also an impossibly amazing oral sex session), but there was never a question as to what was really happening and it WAS even better than when sober.  It was just a great sexual experience, but exaggerated in a positive way.<br>
<br>
After the sex, we got ready for bed.  Although I felt a bit like I had an alcohol buzz, I knew I was completely in control.  But the effects were stronger now (4+ hours after ingestion) than they were earlier!  I was surprised that the high was building after all this time, instead of fading.<br>
<br>
As we watched a comedian on TV, I ate some chocolate.  The sensation in my mouth was simply bizarre.  I could control my mouth's movement, but the feelings connected to eating were delayed, and repeated.  It felt a lot like 'mouse-trails' on old laptop settings looked.  Chewing a bite of chocolate was like biting down a hundred times repeatedly before moving my jaws apart again.  And that action repeated a hundred times too.<br>
<br>
The comedian began a bit about 'people who are high', and I though it was unbelievably funny.  He talked about a delayed reaction, and I thought 'that's EXACTLY what I feel like!'  It was as though he was describing every sensation I had right BEFORE I sensed them.  Then he did a slow-motion re-enactment to show what his bit was like to people who are high.  This was hilarious!  Then I realized I couldn't tell whether he was moving in slow motion or not.  I rewound and replayed this part over and over, trying to figure out whether it was me or him that was acting strange. <br>
<br>
Five hours in, my wife now asleep, I'm having all kinds of strange sensations.  The sheets on my body felt so strange.  Every movement I made felt completely surreal.  It felt much more like what I thought an acid trip would be like than a marijuana high.  Things I saw started swirling, combining and separating again.  It was fun, but strange enough to make me a bit concerned that something was wrong.  I was getting sleepy, and wondering if I was dreaming, but wanting to enjoy the full effect of the high.<br>
<br>
I got up, to see if things would feel as strange out of bed as they did while I was in it.  Going to the kitchen, I noticed several snacks that looked really good.  I remembered hearing about munchies and thought that was happened, but could also recall that I was hungry when I went to bed.  I would look at something on the counter and think 'where did that come from?'  then look away for a moment, turn back and think 'where did that come from?' again.  This happened with everything I looked at.  Suddenly, I realized the unmistakable fact that I was further gone now (almost 6 hours in) than I had been an hour ago, and was losing control of my ability to keep a grip on reality. <br>
<br>
I went back to bed.  EVERYTHING (every movement, thought or sensory input) seemed bizarre, like a crazy, steam-of-consciousness dream.  Usually, it was weird in a good way, but sometimes it was scary weird.  I'm the kind of guy who likes to partially wake up from a scary dream, realize I'm OK, then want to go back and finish the nightmare to see what happens.  So I decided this would be a fun state to drift to sleep, since it already felt like I was dreaming wildly.  Then things got weirder.  I recall trying to steer my thoughts to 'happy' dreams, but often got taken to 'scary' ones.  Each thought triggered another one, but with absolutely no direction whatsoever.  I remember feeling like my mind was racing, but it seemed as though it was in gear and flying down the highway with no steering wheel. Still, I was having fun seeing what would pop up next.  And slowly, my memories drift off into nothing as I fell asleep.<br>
<br>
I woke in the morning, feeling fine.  I'm looking forward to my next experience, and feel like I have the dosage just right for me, but need to take it earlier in the night to enjoy all of it.<!-- End Body -->
