A few weeks after my earlier 15 mg trial with 2C-T-7, a friend of mine heard of 2C-T-7 being very visual, and wanted to try it. I had found my earlier experiment at 15 mg, very nice and moderately visual. At 9pm, I took 20 mg and my friend took 17 mg. Initially, things went fine, as the usual 2C-T-7 effects went by: color/contrast/depth intensifaction, more texture, and a little bit of humor. Unfortunately, we found out that 2C-T-7 is very much a `day-time' compound.  In a dimly lit room at 1 am (bright lights were a bit painful on the eyes, although we didn't have dilated pupils), there was not much happening visually.<BR>
<BR>
At low dosages, 2C-T-7 isn't overwhelming, and is very maliable. That is, you need to relax and let it come, instead of that 2C-T-7 comes along and presents you awesome visuals. This was a bit too much work for my companion, who decided on the spot that he didn't like 2C-T-7 because `if he had to do so much work to notice it, then he didn't want that stuff'. Note that this was just a trial dosage, which was deliberately on the safe side. All effects of the 2C-T-7 were gone in under 6 hours which surprised me, since my 15 mg trial two weeks earlier lasted at least 8 to 10 hours.<BR>
<BR>
The next day, I noticed some residual effects of 2C-T-7, such as just a bit more contrast & brightness, but that appeared to wear off rapidly. In the evening,I wanted to go to a club, to compensate for the talked-down 2C-T-7 experience. I had dediced to take some 2C-B, and since it was already 3am, I decided to snort 12 mg of 2C-B. The advantage of this route of administration is that it comes on quicker, and has a reasonable duration. Although 2C-B taken orally is also OK, it takes longer to take effect, and lasts also longer. Earlier bioassays showed that 12 mg snorted is an ideal dosage, which keeps me firmly in control, with only moderate visuals. So, up the nose it went.<BR>
<BR>
After gathering my stuff (which took only a minute or so) and while biking to the club, I suddenly noticed a kind of `rollercoaster' feeling, combined with the thought `o dear, this is going to be a lot more intense than you've ever experienced'. Next, the road began to move up and down. First just a little bit, and within seconds I see slow excursions of about half a meter. I decide to stop for a trafficlight, and see the road marks slowly float by. The house at the other side of the road is twisting and bending frantically. Auditory hallucinations also kicked in -- repeating tones/patterns consisting of different reverbs. Sortof kraftwerk-like.<BR>
<BR>
I realize that I'm far out, decide that clubbing might be a bit difficult right now, so I head of to a small park nearby. Unfortunately, I had to bike a few km before I get there, and I have to drive a km along a reasonably busy traffic-way. My mental state felt similar to when you're just a bit to drunk to feel confident to drive, but when you're still capable of coordinated actions. Visuals were not really strong during this tour. However, I won't recommend biking/driving under these circumstances, and I was glad I made it to the park.<BR>
<BR>
In the park, the physical effects were so strong that I thought I was going to die (sweating, tapping ankle, etc).  There were some bursts of extreme euphoria, and some giggling about this silly state; at one point, the leaves from a nearby tree got a threatening character, but when I relaxed, they melted away.  After about half an hour, the physical effects subsided, and the trip got a more relaxing character.<BR>
<BR>
Visuals and auditory hallucinations were still strong, and were strongly coupled to me `not-observing|relaxing'. It is really nice to see `fountains of joy'.  Also some very mild synesthesia, when looking at the clouds. Which I found surprisingly overrated; the rolling colors of the sunset were way more impressive. The mental effects were relatively benign; I was just an observer to an impressive amount of visual and aural eye-candy.<BR>
<BR>
After about one and a half hour in the park, I felt cold, and wanted to go home. Alhtough the ride home was visually clean, I was accompanied by a lot of auditory hallucinations. At home, looking at some newspaper pictures gave a different `feel' to each picture; one picture felt `french' and was associated to a kind of haystack-color; other pictures felt `belgian', `italian' or `caribean', each accompanied with soundsamples of the language, and a associated color. Visual activity was down to a `normal' level, and required some relaxation in order to start.<BR>
<BR>
I went to bed somewhere between 7 and 8 am. No residuals the next day, apart from a feeling of amazement. In retrospect, it appears that the potency of 2C-B is multiplied by a factor of two or three by 2C-T-7, and this potentiation lasts for at least a day for 2C-T-7. This effect has also been observed for 2C-T-2, which can be used as a `booster' for 2C-B, if ingested 3 to 4 hours before 2C-B. In this setting, 2C-B has a more `warm' character than the rather cold and rational feel of 2C-T-2.<BR>
<BR>
A last side note: some of the effects of this session were also repeated at lower dosages, and also with other compounds. With phenethylamines, it is almost as if the next experience picks up the trail of the previous one, and then goes on to makes it own experience.<!-- End Body -->
