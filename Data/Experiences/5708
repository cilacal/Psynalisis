The combination of these three substances was done more due to the fact that my group only had a small amount of each one and wanted to make the most of our night.<BR>
<BR>
The night began at around 10 pm with 2 pills of mdma needed for four people, the logical choice was to split them in half and take it nasally. Therefor the pills were crushed, divided and snorted, yeah it hurts, but I was feeling the effects pretty soon.<BR>
<BR>
About five minutes after the pills were snorted each of us took ~5 mg of Foxy orally, one way to forget about the pain from snorting mdma is took taste the foxy :-).  Within about 5 minutes of snorting the mdma its effects started to come on, there wasn't much time to wait it seemed like everyone was peaking pretty quickly and everyone began to get that familiar mdma glow.  Around 11 pm, still feeling the effects of the mdma very strong, I began to feel the foxy start to kick in, mostly in terms of CEV's as well as increased tactile feelings, even on top of mdma I could feel a difference. From past trip reports on mdma taken nasally it seemed to indicate that you began to peak quickly, but you would also begin to come down much faster. I feel that the foxy allowed the relatively small amount of mdma to keep us feeling the 'peak' much longer, instead of a quick up and down.<BR>
<BR>
I would compare the combination of the two to being equal to or greater than a normal dose of mdma taken orally. About 3.5 hours after the Foxy and mdma were taken I finally began to feel the effects start to wear off, it seemed to me like the whole 'trip' had been a peak instead of the usual come up-->peak-->come down. At this point ~200 mg of ketamine was divided up among the four of us and each of us took ~50 mg nasally.  Almost immediately, as ketamine usually does, the effects of mdma were quickly brought back up, as well as an increase in the usual ketamine CEV's, most likely due to the Foxy. This combination led to amazing CEV's, as well as an amazing physical sensation.  Similar to the peak of earlier, yet even more amazing due to the increase in visual stimulation.<BR>
<BR>
At one point each of us was holding hands in a circle and with eyes closed it was hard to distinguish where your hands ended and the persons next to you began, our group became more of a unified body than four seperate ones.  We decided to move into the darkness of the bathroom, hey it didn't seem so strange at the time :-), and was we all sat on the floor and turned the lights off, the bathroom was turned into what could best be described as the Milky Way. Colored stars and trails of light were flying all around my head, and everyone was again with hands together feeling as though we had joined into one.<BR>
<BR>
At around 5 am the effects of the drugs had dropped to minimal levels and it was finally time to get some sleep.<BR>
<BR>
I would have to rate this experience as one of the most enjoyable, it seemed like everything matched in perferct harmony and this is an experience that I will definately be trying again.<!-- End Body -->
