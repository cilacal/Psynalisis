<!-- End DoseChart  -->
<!-- Start Body -->
I went to a friend's house with two other friends to smoke pot. We had a few grams of cripp (very good stuff, I might add) to smoke. We decided to smoke it out of a home-made gravity bong. I got about 3 or 4 hits and a small marijuana brownie, when suddenly the host's brother comes home with a bag full of magic mushrooms. I took a good hand-full and then some and hung out for a bit. <br>
<br>
The details from there on are fuzzy, but I headed to the kitchen to satisfy my munchies and proceeded to eat a few more mushrooms and drink a cup of 'shroom tea. I was pretty high from the weed at this time, and being a lightweight on weed and a first-timer with mushrooms, the high was substantial. I asked whose 'Colt-45' drink was in the fridge, and was told that it was now mine, so I drank it. I vaguely remember making some food, and that's where I stopped remembering what happened for a while.<br>
<br>
With all 3 substances consumed, my friends tell me that I was laying down making hilarious noises and such, but then hopped up on a table and kicked something, which spurred a negative response from my friends. I'm not sure if it's the true source, but this seems to have triggered extreme aggression from me, which was only amplified by everything. <br>
<br>
I remember ranting things like my screen name 'ubertalldude,' some of my friend's names who were far away, and the phrase 'I am trippin' so ass.' During all of this, I was attempting to be restrained and calmed down by my friends, because I was flipping out on everything. <br>
<br>
My body was busy yelling things like 'trigger nigger' (sorry to offend, it's probably a reference to a Saul Williams song called 'Tr(n)igger') and just screaming about everything. I kicked my friend's DTV converter box, Wii, and TV antenna off of his entertainment center. I also took the glass out of a table , flipped it upside-down, and laid in the middle of it. I also bit said table, two of my friends' hands, a blanket, and gnashed my teeth in the air. <br>
<br>
Mind you, during all of this, I was not aware of what was happening because of how high I was. While my body was terrorizing my friends and wreaking havoc on the living room, I thought I was having weird terror-dreams like flying through a storm and being a rubiks cube. <br>
<br>
I started coming-to after the whole terror-dream stage, and remember seeing my friend's brother's face and thinking that it was far too distorted. I thought the table and entertainment center were too distorted, and took my pants off because they were soaked from all the water I had tried to drink and failed at. <br>
<br>
I finally fully came-to in my friend's bedroom. There I saw that the floor fan was melting, and so was my guitar. I headed back out to the living room to see what was really up, and remember seeing weed lying everywhere. Then I saw my friend's brother and his friend in the living room smoking a cigarette. The cigarette looked cartoonish and huge, so I took a few drags. I said 'Damn, I can see why people get addicted to these things.' <br>
<br>
I headed to the kitchen, and saw the Colt 45 laying on the floor, so I picked it up, stared at it, and made some noise resembling 'GDaaaaaaughhhhh.' I headed back to the two in the living room, and saw that the room was shrinking like in a movie. The the couch was melting into the walls, and the two people on the couch were melting into it. Everything seemed to be severely distorted, and I vocalized many times that I was tripping balls. I could describe all the distortions I saw, but it'd take too long, and anybody who has taken magic mushrooms or LSD already knows what I'm talking about.<br>
<br>
I went back to my friend's room and hung with my friends for a bit, but they were mostly afraid of me, so they went to go sleep in another room. Except, that is, for one of my friends who was in a chair tripping and enjoying himself. He told me to play some cool music, so I played All Mixed Up by 311 on the game Audiosurf (which, I must say, is one of the trippiest games ever and extremely fun in any mind state) and basically aimlessly roamed around the house for a while. <br>
<br>
After a while of this, I began to come down off everything and started to realise what I had done. The living room was a mess, and I felt my underwear, realising that at some point in the night that I had shat my pants. I went to the restroom, ran out of toilet paper, and decided to take a shower. <br>
<br>
By this time, it was about 6 AM. I ate the brownie at about 10 PM the previous day, smoked the weed soon afterwards, ate the shrooms at about 11 PM, and remembered looking at a clock for the first time after flipping out at about 4:50 AM. I had somehow given myself a scrape on my right shoulder, two scrapes on my chin, and a good cut on my right hand. <br>
<br>
I got about 5 hours of sleep, but was awakened by my dad calling me to come home. For the next few days, I reflected upon the trip and became terribly depressed, thinking I was going to feel like that forever. After a few days, I realized I was fine and that the fear was just that: fear. Now I feel fine, and am willing to try them again, but this time, with a bit more precaution.<!-- End Body -->
