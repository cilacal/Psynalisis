I purchased a fair amout of Dexies for a relatively CHEAP price. I remember asking my dad questions about it and joking with my aunt (who is in the medical field as well as my family) how she should run marathons on it. I had never dreamed of ever finding any in my life.....<BR>
<BR>
Afer an exam (I'm 14 and in the 9th grade) on a friday, I got home to a pill that I was told was Oxycocet (Oxycodone). After checking everywhere in PH Desk R. It was nowhere to be found. So I dug up an old doccument on a drug Forum and the pill was found out to be a Canadian version of Percocet. Well I live in Canada and was sure happy that they matched. <BR>
<BR>
T-0:00 (11:35am)- Down one Oxycocet (Oxycodone 5mg and acetominophen 500mg) Anxious, this is my first time with Oxycodone. I've had much experience will Codeine and used to it's effects.<BR>
<BR>
T-0:05- Start cooking some lunch in case I can't while under the influence.<BR>
<BR>
T-0:30- Typical opiate like symtoms. I start typing slower, and feeling in a good happy mood.<BR>
<BR>
T-1:00 (12:00pm)- I'm getting rolling eyes and feeling slightly euphoric. Better than codeine. Codeine tends to make me heavy and I must lay down. Though walking is fun on codeine. But on Oxy its not as fun, but the mental effects are better.<BR>
<BR>
T-1:15-I notice that functioning is easier with Oxycodone than with Codeine. I'm chatting with a friend. She tells me her mother has plenty of Oxycontin and Morphine. I want to buy, but she cannot access them due to a locked door. No problems... Than the most intense momment happends, a direct quote 'What is Dexedrine?'. I freak I tell her all about it and what it does. Her brother takes it for his ADHD and has quite a bit. I want to buy, she agrees. We set up a deal, and I will bike to her house when her parents leave.<BR>
<BR>
T-1:50- I'm so exited, my Oxy effects seem to disappear. Though I am still feeling sort of loose. I get the call and head over.<BR>
<BR>
T-2:30 (1:30pm)- The deal is made, I'm biking home with a pocket full of Dexdrine, amazing. This was so unbelievable.<BR>
<BR>
T-2:45- I check the pill's ingredients (5mg of Dextro-amphetamine Sulfate) I let excitement take over me. I cut it up with a spoon and knife, make a few lines, get a straw and shoot the orange coloured powder into my nasal passage. Dumb idea.<BR>
<BR>
T-2:50- Not quite feeling anything yet, methylphenidate takes a least 20 mins to kick in, so I figure a Sulfate salt form of amphetamine would work somewhat as easy. Obviously hydrochloride salt is better. I feel like my nose is runnning, and I feel drip. I check in the mirror and I find orange dye running out my nose! Fuck. I forgot about that... excitement is deadly. I am spitting up dye also. I notice my breathing is depressed and I wonder if the non-active ingredients had contained chalk or something. <BR>
<BR>
T-3:15- The dye has stopped running and I'm no longer spitting it up. I don't notice a slight high. I boost with 2 more Dexedrine tablets orally. <BR>
<BR>
T-3:45- I'm jacked, my eyes are wide open and this beats any Methylphenidate high easily. I'm typing to friends very fast and then tell me to slow down. I notice unlike ephedrine and methamphetamine (which I have heard does, but I've never tried it) my hair on my head doesn't seem to be feeling stuck up. I'm quite calm talkative and cetainly euphoric. <BR>
<BR>
T-4:30- This is what my estimated time that I thought the Oxy would wear off. The effects have not been apparent for over 3hrs. Damn. <BR>
<BR>
T-5:00- It like no time has gone by. I don't notice that I've been on my computer for 3hrs. typing. Whew, this is good stuff. I have the feeling I'll be jacked for most of the night. My eyes are forced open, I can't close my eyes, let alone barely blink. I start conversing to a friend that has tried MDMA to not try it again (I have never tried MDMA and I don't beleive I ever will). I tell her of negative effects. She discards what I say and goes off about how 'she doesnt care' and 'would like to die happily'. She is very agressive, and my emotions are increased. I start freaking, she doesn't seem to be real. It seems like a joke, shes fucking with me. But I was real, I just couldn't take it in. Crazyness... Well we made up and stopped fighting. She was also quite jealous of the Dexies. I sort of like her, she's cool. But now I'm scared, seeing her like that under the influence of Dexedrine is insane. I'm sort of freaked and do not have the same opinion of her as before. <BR>
<BR>
T-6:00 to 8:45 (5:00pm-7:45pm)- My father and I decide to go out to dinner. He is an Anesthesiologist and knows a great deal about 'substances', well so I thought. He had no idea I was under the influence. Well maybe since I ate very little, was pissing every 20mins and eyes wide open he might have suspected something. Amazing, we talked about drugs at dinner for a long time. I notice I was quite constipated from the Oxycodone. <BR>
<BR>
T-9:30 (8:30pm)- I'm still very jacked, not freaked anymore, but just jacked. I'm grinding straws in my teeth, my jaw is slightly clenched. We visit his parents, I have nice conversations with them.<BR>
<BR>
T-10:50-13:00 (9:50pm to 12am)- Return home, I'm still jacked and constipated. I decide for more chat. My dad goes off to bed and I chat my head off for another 4 hours till my mother and sister  return from an outing. Time flys by so fast, but I feel this day has been the equivlent of two. <BR>
<BR>
T-13:01-13:30- I'm being agressive and mad at people for their own stupidnesses. I fight with potheads, and I try to understand a good friend with an eating disorder. This is sad. She has been in the hospital for 2 weeks for anorexia and she now back at a normal weight. She tells me how she is still anorexic and is so prideful. I tottaly understand the irony of the situation, I'm so sad for her that I become very agressive and bring back many past things to try and change her. I feel useless not to be able to help her. I must help her. I get off the chat and I want to rest, my body is tired, but my mind isn't. I'm hungry, but I can't eat. This seems normal for an amphetamine. <BR>
<BR>
T-13:31-14:30)- I listen to a full CD in bed. I can't sleep. I decide to force myself to eat wondering if that will have effect. I eat 2 bananas, cheese and some chips.<BR>
<BR>
T-15:00-15:30? or 16:00?)- Sleep is still not easy, but I'm so exhausted I belive I just passed out. Jacked for 12hrs. WOW.<BR>
<BR>
I wake up feeling tired, I didn't get much sleep. I woke up a few times. I wasn't much constipated in the morning from the Oxycodone. <BR>
<BR>
Now normally I usually do a new substance I have never tried before alone, but on this occasion I took a chance. Nothing bad went wrong and I learned valuable things:<BR>
<BR>
1. Be prepared----> What is bad about combining a narcotics and stimulants is that I wouldn't be able to take a depressent to make you pass out. I wouldn't take the chance, people die that way.  <BR>
<BR>
2. Narcotic withdrawl----> Strangely it didnt happen. This may have been avoided with Dexedrine. <BR>
<BR>
3. Addicting----> Both of these drugs have obvious abuse potential. I would probly be more suseptible to amphetamine addiction. I do have an urge to repeat the Oxycodone experience but in higher dose. I will try to avoid possible abuse as best as I can. <BR>
<BR>
I believe this was a positive and moving experience, I will never repeat this combination. I do plan to use these drugs sometime later, but in moderation.<!-- End Body -->
