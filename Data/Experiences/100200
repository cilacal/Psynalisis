I took one blotter of 25I-NBOMe around noon, knowing that it was stronger than usual. I insufflated approximately 30mg of MXE 45 minutes later. As I started coming up, I realized that I have never tripped as intensely on any other substance. As I was showering with my boyfriend, I thought he teleported out of the shower for a split second. <br/>
<br/>
Slowly, it started to become too intense and I started to completely lose touch with reality. It got to a point where I believed that I was unconscious or dead, and I entered a state of 'Excited Delirium'. The only part that I remember distinctly was the very peak of the experience, where I 'died'. The entire room started brightening to near-white and my friends who were all dressed up for the major triannual campus party all sprouted wings and angelic features. After that it was mostly a blur.<br/>
<br/>
However, I do remember that my heart was beating like a machine gun, I was screaming the same phrase over and over again and was running around my college campus. I didn't recognize any of my friends; I thought my brain was tricking me to believe that my RAs and my friends were not who they were, and that these 'random' people that I know and love dearly were out to get me. <br/>
<br/>
I punched my RA when he was trying to assess the situation (sorry man!). Eventually, campus police officers had to tackle me, handcuff me, and hold me down as I attempted to bang my arms, legs, and scraped my face against the concrete tiles in the middle of the courtyard of palms surrounding the three freshman dorms until the ambulance came (oh, and my friend told me that I apparently also punched a campus cop).<br/>
<br/>
I didn't come back from 'The Land' until I was in the ambulance, tied down, and they have given me some kind of sedative or antipsychotic. My body was bruised in multiple places, however, luckily, I didn't break any bones. I was told in the hospital that an enzyme, which normally has a count of approximately 800 per blood test, was at 14000, and that I nearly experienced kidney failure. <br/>
<br/>
My thought process has noticeably shifted ever since that trip. I noticed it after being in the hospital for a couple hours, and it never went away. I also have not had a dream in my sleep ever since that experience.<!-- End Body -->
