So last night I took ~20mg of pure 2c-i. My friend's scale supposedly does 10 mg increments, but the thing was all over the place, didn't really want to register shit, however I think in the end we ended up getting our doses pretty close to 20-25 mg a piece. So around 11pm my friend and I each roll up our powered dose in a bit of toilet paper and swallow it. We then take a few bong rips, with me and my low tolerance getting rather high, and my friend getting just a little buzzed. After that, we go outside and talk to a bunch of people that he knows. Just casual conversation. It was night, and we both started to feel it by 12, although I was feeling it much more strongly. We both stared a bit at the lights and the moon, and generally had a great time talking to these people that we normally wouldn't do more than say 'hi' to.<br/>
<br/>
Around now the times are kinda guesstimated, btw...<br/>
<br/>
After another half hour (so it's around 12.30 now), I decided I had to pee, but I couldn't figure out if the little porta potty was a shed or a porta potty, and everyone kept fucking with me. I ended up getting thrown into a bush (still standing, not hard or anything) after trying to shove my much larger friend into it. For some reason I was in a play-fighting mood all night, shoving and fucking around, but never actually hitting anyone.<br/>
<br/>
So I get to the porta potty (I'm pretty sure it WAS a porta potty), and just completely tripped my face off in it. I distinctly recall watching my piss hit the blue water (hence why I'm almost certain it WAS a porta potty), but the little pin holes at the top of the porta potty were completely fucking with me, and it was all I could do to lean against the door and piss. After this my friend and I walked to a convenience store, the short walk was quite a trip. All of the buildings had lights on them, and each car sort of stuck out to me. In some TV shows, like Pimp My Ride (not that I really watch it), in the intro they make the cars sort of *pop* out of the background, and that's exactly what was happening. It was wayyyy intense. The one rock road was also crazy, I think it was the classic 'persian rug' type visual. I bought a Code Red and some peanut butter cups ( but didn't eat the second one, and just drank a small swig or two). I remember trying to give the cashier my money, and trying to be chill about it, but I was quite certain he knew I was retarded, as I kept looking away from him and just cracking up.<br/>
<br/>
After stumbling back out, my friend and I decided to leave my car, and walk about a mile to these two brothers house. After a rather long walk, with the headlights completely fucking with me, we finally got into the house, and chilled for quite a while. I was gone, and even though it was a chill setting, in my head it wasn't. I get like this often on a lot of drugs, can't really explain it, but every once in a while I realize that everything is peaceful and chill, and even though I'm not being that loud or obnoxious, in my mind it's just a storm of thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
At around two I called my anti-drug gf who was asleep, and tried talking to her. She was PISSED off, but I didn't really let it bother me, as she always gets pissed about these things. The four of us decided to go to a local restaurant at around 2.30 - 3.00, and we walked back the mile to my car, and I slowly drove the mile or two to the place.  <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> <br/>
<br/>
Once there I realized my stomach hurt, but I was so hungry. I ate a bit, and drank half my Coke. I was laughing my ass off, as was my partner in crime. I was coming down a bit, while he said it was still getting more intense.<br/>
<br/>
By 4.30 we went our ways, with me and my friend driving back to his house to get our stashes and weigh out some shit for him. The weighing didn't go so well since we were both fucked, but it kinda worked out. He took some more bong hits, while I decided I had to go home. At this time, I was definately coming down, while he said it was the most intense it had been the whole time. It seems like his trip was delayed an hour or two compared to mine, perhaps his stomach was full or something.<br/>
<br/>
So I walked back to my car (parked a ways away), and was just peaceful and happy as the sun rose. I didn't want to go to sleep once I got home, so I texted my friend a bit, and he said he was still tripping hardcore. Note it's about 6 now, and he has work at 10. I opened my blinds and watched the trees sway in the breeze a bit (okay, so I was still a bit fucked up, but I was controlled and peaceful now). I finally went to sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Around 11 I got a text from my friend at work. He was fine, but had licked the scale clean (er, I think he used a damp finger, he couldn't leave anything on the scale, other people use it etcetc), and he said he was still tripping. I don't know if that means tripping hard or not... But he said 'I didn't think the little bit on the scale would matter - I was wrong', so he must have been pretty messed up.<br/>
<br/>
The one odd thing was that I got a feeling that I almost shit my pants or something, and had a strange feeling/worry all night about having shit all over myself. Don't laugh, it happens to me a lot for some reason (that I pissed myself or something), don't know why... Also, I think I may have been clenching my jaw or something, or smiling too hard, as it felt like the muscles around my head were really tight.<br/>
<br/>
Also, I swear I'm just hypersensitive to drugs, period. A few hits of weed fucks me up, and although I've been smoking quite a bit, a few hits STILL fucks me up. I'll have to ask my friend today overall how intense his trip was, but mine was wayyy intense. Just a little background...<br/>
<br/>
Today, right now, is the 'day after', and I feel alright. I only got 4 hours of sleep due to having to go places, so I'm tired as shit, and generally just feel like chilling out. I'm not really all that hungry, either. Don't feel hungover or anything though.<!-- End Body -->
