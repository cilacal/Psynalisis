<!-- Start Body -->
My age:  36<br>
<br>
Setting:  At home with my husband 'babysitting' me.<br>
<br>
Dosing time:  10:30pm<br>
<br>
Chemicals previously taken:  about 2 martinis earlier in the evening   (6:30pm and 8:30pm).  150mg vicodin @7:00pm.  I had had a normal size meal at about 8:00pm.  <br>
<br>
Antidepressants: I normally take 80mg of prozac.  I was off it for 72 hours previous to dosing.<br>
<br>
My big mistake:  Taking psychedelics while I had an aching wisdom tooth. I had forgotten about that pain because of the vicodon.<br>
<br>
12:30am:  first signs of effects.  Started with colors a bit more glowy.<br>
<br>
Very quickly went to visual 'phasing'ù-slight shifting of superimposed images, resulting in patterns.  Stomach felt a little whirly-not too bad.  None of the feelings of euphoria that I usually experience with other psychedelics at their onset. <br>
<br>
1:30am:  Stomach feeling more whirly.  Visual effects more intense.  Brain and mental focus seem normal.  Very much able to observe and evaluate my mood and effects.  I feel a little cold and take a bath.  Warm water feels great and the marbleized tile is great to watch!<br>
<br>
2:30am:  Tripping very intense.  Visual phasing very intense and forming lots of patterns.  Superimposed translucent pattern in bits of electric blue and green.  This is something I've noticed with LSD, except with LSD the pattern seemed to be more a yellow green color.<br>
<br>
Balance is now off.  Whirly feeling more intense, Anxious and slightly crampy feeling, no nausea.  Mental functions less focused and in control.  In fact, at this point I woke up my husband who had been napping because I was a little concerned about my ability to self-monitor.<br>
<br>
The intensity of tripping is equal to some of the more intense LSD I've done, though much less jaggy.<br>
<br>
3:30am: My wisdom tooth is starting to hurt, but I'm afraid to take vicodon because of the already uncomfortable load on my stomach.  My husband walks me downstairs and I am able to make myself some Ume tea Japanese plum extract that is very soothing on the stomach.  <br>
<br>
At this point visuals are most intense, and I comment to my husband that this would be very interesting if my stomach and tooth didn't hurt.  I do get a great deal of pleasure by snuggling with my silky soft long haired loving kitty.  However, my main purpose in dosing tonight was in hopes of enhanced sex, and I don't feel the slightest bit sexual.<br>
<br>
4:30am: 6 hours from dosing, and I'm definitely finally down a little bit.  I notice that my skin is a bit ichy all over, as well as feeling as if it were dissociated from my body.  If I didn't know not to, it would be very easy at this point to scratch holes in my skin.<br>
<br>
It also occurs to me that this dissociated sensation could be advantageous for sex, and my husband and I enjoy some very delightful sex play.  Finally a purpose for this high!<br>
<br>
5:30am:  Took 150mg of vicodon and more Ume tea.  I turned on the TV to help me ride out the rest of the trip.  I've noticed that I'm less likely to have visual effects when watching tv.  Still itchy.<br>
<br>
7:30am:  Beautiful dawn out the window.  Still itchy.  Still some slight visual effects.  Exhausted and can'ôt sleep.  A shower doesn't help my itchy skin.  Take another 150mg vicodon.<br>
<br>
11:30am:  Finally able to snooze, though skin still feels weird.  <br>
<br>
6:00pm:  Completely down<br>
<br>
In conclusion:  Interesting but not comfortable or fun.  Greatest epiphany I had is that we really need to finish the bathroom remodel!  Nice cuddling with my husband on the way down-really aware of his sweetness and my love for him.  Sex was enhanced, but not as much as with other psychedelics I've done.  Overall a waste of time, except for fulfilling my promise to a friend to try 2ce and report.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<!-- End Body -->
