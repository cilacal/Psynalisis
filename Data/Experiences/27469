<!-- Start Body -->
The very best drug I've ever tried. This stuff is amazing. I took 1 20mg dose at around 1 o clock.  I had been up since 6 that morning and was exhausted.  I really didn't expect to be up for very much longer.  I began feeling the effects in about 30 minutes.  It began with the feeling of mild pain killers.  This changed very quickly though.  Soon it heightened to the point of an intense opiate-like body high.  Very Very strong.  This took about 45 minutes.  I hit a plateau where I just stayed in this intense body sensation.  Stretching felt amazing and just lying on the floor was just about all I could do.  I was at a low +3.<BR>
<BR>
During this period the drug was extremely intense in the body aspect yet I had not gotten many visuals.  Also it wasn't a very pleasant high.  It was slightly uncomfortable.  I was feeling a bit naseous.  I was still able to think pretty clearly though.<BR>
<BR>
I was almost dissappointed at the drug.  Not dissappointed that I had taken it but dissapponted that I wasn't enjoying it.  It was, how do I say, uncomfortably intense.<BR>
<BR>
This feeling went away very suddenly though.  Soon the body high began to come down a little.  I began to think that I had peaked and was coming down.  I was wrong.  My sense of time was gone, it had only been about 2 hours sinse I took it.<BR>
<BR>
Visuals hit me very suddenly.  There was a rush to it, almost like uppers.  The body high changed to an extasy like feeling.  My senses were heightened.  Touch was magnified.  Taste was through the roof.  Water tasted like a 'holy nector', which is how I put it at the time.<BR>
<BR>
The visuals...definitely the best part of the high.  I have never gotten better visuals...ever!  This put acid to shame!  There is no sense of uncomfortableness anymore.  The chance of a fearful or paranoid trip, like on some halucinagins, is not there at all.<BR>
<BR>
-Full perspective visuals!!!<BR>
On halucinagins that I've done before my perspective will be relatively normal accept for maybe one object that I concentrate on.  On the 2C-T-2 my entire field of vision was in a visualistic party.  'the fan is eating me!!' were some of my exact words (I didn't really believe this, but the ceiling fan looked like a blooming flower that was wrapping itself around me).  Every different kind of visual is there.  I had distortions like waves and ripples.  There was patterning where my perspective would look almost like a well woven persian carpet.  Flashing neon lights.  warping, bending, melding, etc.  I had even gone to the bathroom and watched my own face distort and flow.  it didn't stop either.  Then there was the tracers.  I waved my hand in front of my face to find a trail of energy like waves , tailing off of it.  ABSOLUTELY AMAZING!<BR>
<BR>
These visuals lasted about 3 hours I think.. I don't really, know I wasn't watching the clock.  I did however continue to have mild visuals till about 9:00 a clock that morning.<BR>
<BR>
The body high during all of this, which was after I had come down from the intense opiated state, was a very enjoyable yet intense extasy like feeling.<BR>
<BR>
I was enjoying ever part of this high.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't go to sleep that night.  I probably could have fallen asleep around 8:00ish 7 hours after I had taken it, but I didn't.  I worked that day too, and furthermore went to my highschool homecoming that night.  There was a mild afterglow, nothing inhibiting though.  I was able to function normally.<BR>
<BR>
What a drug.  Safer than extasy simply because it isn't cut with other drugs.  Something I'm going to have to experiment just a bit with...definitely something special.  Not like anything I've done before<!-- End Body -->
