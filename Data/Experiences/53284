 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span>  <br>

Recently I acquired 40mg of 2C-E in one bag from a friend.  This is the first time that I had ever taken a phenylthylamine.  I decided to take half the bag.  I busted it out and separated it into two lines.  So it was 20 and 20.  Taking 20mg of 2c-e orally is a hard enough trip in itself.  Not knowing how crazy it was instead of taking the 20mg orally I snorted it. <br>
<br>
All I have to say is that this was the fastest that any drug has ever kicked in.  Approximately 3 minutes after snorting it a very strong feeling started to come over me.  The walls began to flash and I began to fry very very hard.  An extremely strong sense of terrifying fear and paranoia began to come over me.  Basically I began to wig out.  I began to become very sick to my stomach and started vomiting.  Even thought I was freaking out extremely hard, the visuals that ensued were fucking ridiculous.  <br>
<br>
As I was staring at the ground the grass looked liked octagon shaped stained glass in sections swirling in and out of each other.  After the I stopped throwing up and freaking out approximately an hour after I had snorted it I went to sit down inside.  I was still frying very and couldn’t stop shaking.  <br>
<br>
About 4 hours into it I began to feel sane again and started to calm down.  The drug finally wore off totally about 8 hours after taking it. This was my first time taking a phenylthylamine and I obviously made a huge mistake snorting 2C-E.<!-- End Body -->
