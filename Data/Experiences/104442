Background- I’ve been a rather avid drug user doing about anything presented to me. I’ve smoked a lot of weed and a fair amount of opium; I’ve done LSD, 2C-B, Cocaine, Mushrooms, Adderall, Concerta, Xanax and a wide variety of pain pills. One thing that always interested me that I have never had the opportunity to do was Amphetamines, I was mostly interested in MDMA but it isn’t the highest of quality in my area. <br/>
<br/>
One of my friends has a pretty good hook up for ADHD medication and while I had tried different kinds none of them really got me up like it did everyone else since I have ADHD and I require a good sized dose to start speeding. My friend got me two 70 mg Vyvanse’s and I decided to take it at night since I had homework.<br/>
<br/>
Day One<br/>
T + 0:00 -- 8:30 pm. I’ve not slept a whole lot in the past few days so take one of the Vyvanse’s.<br/>
T + 30:00 -- I’m chilling at my buddy’s place smoking some bud and waiting for the Vyvanse to kick in before I head to my dorm. I feel slightly euphoric and like I have a little more energy than normal but this could be from the bud we're smoking.<br/>
<br/>
T + 1:00:00 – I can feel the Vyvanse’s starting to kick in, I can hardly stay still and I am feeling very euphoric, it reminds me of a coke high in a way.<br/>
T + 1:30:00 – I am feeling very good, I’m focused and feel like I can do anything I put my mind to. At this point I have become very friendly and will not stop talking; I feel no effects from the bud we had been smoking.<br/>
<br/>
T + 2:00:00 – I decide it’s about time to head by to the room and start on my essay, on the way back I still won’t stop talking which is odd because I’m really a keep to myself kind of person.<br/>
T + 3:00:00 – I’ve typed about half of the essay, I’ve really only spent about 10 minutes typing and the rest of the time having deep conversation with a girl threw text messages, I was extremely quick at typing and very accurate. I’ve become very open and honest toward this girl, which again is odd for me but it was as if I couldn’t stop myself.<br/>
<br/>
T + 4:00:00 – I’ve typed a little more of my paper while still getting side tracked with my conversation. At this point the conversation is what I am focused on and my paper has taken a back seat.<br/>
T + 4:10:00 – The girl went to sleep so I finally focused on getting my essay done which literally took no time once I started, I decide that since I finished I would reward myself by going back over to my buddy’s house and smoke some more bud.<br/>
<br/>
T + 5:00:00 – I’ve been smoking bud for about 30 or 40 minutes taking some massive bong rips but I feel nothing from the bud at all which is very odd considering how high quality this bud really is. I decide there’s no point in me staying there and wasting any more bud than I have already so I head back to the room.<br/>
<br/>
T + 6:00:00 – Me and my roommate decide that we will smoke the last of what bud we have, still have no effects from it so I tell him to just smoke it since it’s a waste for me to use it. This is the friendliness that has come over me as I would never just let someone smoke my bud without me smoking it too.<br/>
T + 7:00:00 – Its 3:00 am and I can see that there is no chance of me sleeping so I decide to stroll through the internet aimlessly.<br/>
T + 10:00:00 – I’ve exhausted all my options of entertaining myself and feel like there is no other real option other than try and sleep.<br/>
<br/>
T + 13:00:00 I wake up surprised that I managed to actually fall asleep, the weekend had consisted of a lot of weed smoking, cocaine doing and my first experience with Amphetamines so by this point I had had about 10 hours of sleep in three days so I knew that I need to take my other Vyvanse in order to make it threw my classes, which I did.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion: Vyvanse is a nice drug. I would compare the high to a sort of milder cocaine high that lasts for 12 hours. It is an Amphetamine so I would not recommend anyone do this drug on a daily basis nor will I do this on a daily basis. Vyvanse’s made me feel euphoric, friendly, talkative, and extremely focused.<!-- End Body -->
