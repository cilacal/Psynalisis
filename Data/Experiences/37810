This concerns A’s and my second experience with 2C-T-2 and first experience with Mescaline cacti. The setting was a country cottage in Michigan – serene, open, natural, full of beautiful plant life - perfect for a trip. <BR>
<BR>
We obtained a quantity of the crystals, bought a scale and relative equipment, and carefully measured out 20 mg doses, checking and re-checking for accuracy. We finally finished the tedious work, cleaned up, made a toast with our glasses of water and each threw a 20 mg dose down the hatch.<BR>
<BR>
The nausea was much worse than the first time. Discomfort set in quickly, after about 20 minutes, and persisted into the second hour. Existing knowledge of the drug's dimensions seemed to make for an anxious onset.<BR>
<BR>
We fully arrived at the drug’s dimensions at roughly T+140 minutes, a longer onset than the first time (which was approx. 100 minutes). Visuals and euphoria were significant. For at least two hours we stared into a vast field of wild flowers, watching them flow into each other and breath themselves into faces, people, and apparently meaningless but fantastic shapes and colors. The little stone gnome – a yard ornament – was hilarious. As we stared at it, it moved and appeared to be alive, ready to say something.<BR>
<BR>
Unfortunately, the cottage is on the same plot of land as the house owned by A's angry grandfather (it’s family land). We kept talking about what would happen if he showed up, and sure enough, the man tore up the driveway while our trip was in its most powerful phase. He started yelling at A for not being willing to help him shovel dirt. As he yelled and screamed, we just stood there agape. The man looked like a machine; not even human. His face morphed and bubbled, on top of the fact that it was already twisted in anger. After he left, we regressed into the woods and had deep conversation about the problematic confinement inherent in family (“family is your own anti-matter gun”), the meaning of relationships, religion, and so forth. It was a truly amazing conversation, and I remember little of it. In my view, 2C-T-2’s ability to open astonishing avenues of conversation is hands down its greatest attribute. The mind feels completely detached, uncluttered. The built up pressure of subjectivity seems to be released. “Ruthless clarity of communication” indeed.<BR>
<BR>
We began to come down after three or four hours on the plateau, and felt great. It was at this point that we began chopping up the two lengths of San Pedro I had brought with me. We cut up the cactus (we did not skin it; we used all of the plant) and blended it into juice. We boiled the mixture for about three hours, and spent an hour drinking two cups each of the bitter green juice (this is now roughly T+8 hours). Since we didn’t strain it, there were chunks of cactus flesh in the tea. It is indeed difficult to drink, but not unbearable as some say.<BR>
<BR>
Effects from this particular San Pedro were subtle. First we both got nauseous, then went to sleep on the floor. We slept for about forty minutes and then woke up, feeling “weird.” Gradually the mescaline started percolating. There was euphoria, mild shape bending on occasion, and some auditory hallucinations. It was very earthy and, compared to 2C-T-2, felt much like a depressant. Overall it was very pleasant. The effects only lasted a few hours. We should've stopped here. <BR>
<BR>
We then broke open a 20 mg 2C-T-2 capsule and dissolved 5 mg each into two glasses of water, and drank it. We waited a few hours and felt nothing. Erratically, we decided to insufflate a small dose. We carefully weighed out another 5 mg of the powder, split it in half by eye, and each snorted it (2-3 mg each). Absolutely nothing happened. Ten minutes later, we repeated this procedure with the remaining 5 mg of the 20 mg dose we initially broke open. After this second insufflated dose, we were instantly propelled back into the full-blown 2C-T-2 trip. The immediacy of onset was traumatic. Within a few minutes, we were both locked into a harrowing fear of death and dying, a la “my heart is going to stop pumping.” Shapes did not pattern gently as with oral ingestion, but seemed to “boil over” with a gruesome speed and incoherence. Everything was infinitely layered, shifting, and terrifying. There were voices chattering as well. A kept hearing an Austrian voice 'talking excitedly about schizophrenia.' Whether or not the mescaline was amplified here, I have no idea, since I had never taken mescaline nor snorted 2C-T-2 before. My guess is that the mescaline was indeed amplified. <BR>
<BR>
We took charge of the situation, paced, kept moving, and kept our eyes darting to subdue the visual effects. We had a good deal of meaningful conversation during this turmoil. We did the dishes, kept pacing, and did anything to avoid sitting or laying stationary. It was very effective. We finally calmed down about 5 hours later, and effects completely subsided at about 4 am, roughly 21 hours after the first 20 mg capsules were swallowed.<BR>
<BR>
We knew immediately that we had screwed up and approached the psychedelic experience disrespectfully. Yet, overcoming this mistake had its rewards. The most important lesson of this trip is, if you have some 2C-T-2 and you are going to work with it, just don’t mess around with insufflating, in any quantity. We were both well aware of reports from others warning us not to insufflate, and we did it anyway. Now our warning is added to the others. 2C-T-2 and mescaline may also be a bad combo. I will not combine the two again. Each is sufficient on its own.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the trip was remarkable in its intensity and duration, as well as its mixture of feelings, emotions and visions. It was a marathon trip that served to calibrate my own future use of psychedelics. The 20+ hour journey included total euphoria, extreme visual effects, harrowing fear, and, finally, victory over the latter. Since this phenethylamine marathon, my curiosity about psychedelic states is sky high, and my aptitude for misusing psychedelics is much lower. Learning lessons like this is dangerous but rewarding work.<!-- End Body -->
