First I want to excuse for my bad English, hope that I could make myself understood!  Recently so did I send in a Bad trip report with 2C-B, but I didn't write that I still use it and probably will continue until my death. <BR>
<BR>
The first time I took 2C-B was when I where alone at home, for a long time had I felt myself not to belong anywhere.  My mood was very blue, and I must confess that I didn't even know what 2C-B was, just heard that it was good but no one I know have tried it.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway I just swallow the pill and wrote down the time 18.41, just before this have I eaten a big meal food.  At about 19.20 so did I call my friend and tell him what a crap this substance was, then suddenly things started to happen.  I was looking at a Steven Seagal movie, and I saw how his head suddenly looked like the elephantman....didn't understood anything and when I looked around all things started to be morphed.<BR>
<BR>
I quickly ended the communication with my friend, and now things really started to happen, I put on some music, which took me quite a while because everything was morphing and my sights zoomed in and out.  When the music started, I felt like an explosion inside of me and I could see my aura, and everything I looked at was so incredible beautiful.  And even the simplest thing like pouring up a glass of water was incredible to watch.<BR>
<BR>
It's so hard to describe, but let me say like this...it was like being in paradise.<BR>
<BR>
Then my mind started to think ' who am I?’  'What am I?' and believe me when I say that I found out a lot of answers, in this trip.  I don’t believe in god, but after this trip I believe that everyone is their own god.  And I believe that there is a life after death, I been there as far a man can go with the chance to come back (but this is another story..Don’t know if I should write it down).<BR>
<BR>
Don't remember who wrote it but ' 2C-B is a tool’, rightly used it is a wonderful substance.  Used wrongly and it is your worst nightmare, I must say to you how important it is with a good friend that could help you if it went wrong in your trip.<BR>
<BR>
I myself had a real asshole of a friend on one trip, because instead of talking me down he started to fuck up my brain and told me that I gonna die and that he was God and so on (had a real hell to get back to senses)....but believe me one day will he get what he deserved because what comes around goes around.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, even when I closed my eyes beautiful colours passed by and must say that never had music been so good.  A WARNING though, don’t play music that take you down because 2C-B has a naughty side that could make you feel so depressed that its frightening.  And don't take a shower like me, for in some way 2C-B had make my body real sensitive and my hearing had increased so when I started to shower it felt like needles all over my body...now can I laugh about it but I remembered that I ran out naked in the garden.  Just to get away from the pain and the sound of water pouring down.<BR>
<BR>
Everything felt for the first time in my life, WONDERFUL!  I strongly recommend this drug, because it can take you to dimensions that I haven't reach with other drugs.  And please instead for pleasure (because 2C-B is incredible to have sex or masturbate with) use it to discover new dimensions... <BR>
<BR>
Here come some tips to reach beyond with 2C-B:<BR>
<BR>
1. Turn off the telephone, Put on music that you like (on random)<BR>
<BR>
2. Turn off the lights (just light a candle)<BR>
<BR>
3. Sit down and relax, Focus on the candle<BR>
<BR>
4. When the ride starts...focus and feel yourself wander away into the unknown (this may not work the first time, but you soon will have the outside body experience)<BR>
<BR>
'Better to wander into the unknown than to crawl in reality'<BR>
