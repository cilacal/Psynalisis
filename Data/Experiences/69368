<!-- End DoseChart  -->
<!-- Start Body -->
Today I'll be consuming 1.5mg of lorazepam with a method I've never tried. I'm going to crush up the entire 1.5mg, and put it onto a single-ply (small) square of toilet paper. I of course cut out this small square, roughly 1 inch x 1 inch or so. Then I'll put it in my mouth, and swallow with some orange juice.<br>
Around my area, I don't know about others, but this method is often done with ecstasy pills and methadone. It's referred to as “parachuting”. (Northern California)<br>
<br>
(9:51) T+0:00 – Parachuted 1.5mg of lorazepam. I'm just sitting behind my computer, reading and listening to The Brian Jonestown Massacre. At this point (before the drug has taken effect) I'm having a few knots in my stomach, just anxious to do something, but can't. Today was an interesting day, had to comfort a crying friend, etc. So overall my mood/setting is just, slightly anxious, and bored. Nothing major going on in my mind.<br>
<br>
(10:15) T+0:24 – Starting to feel a cool feeling along my body, the small knots in my stomach are gone, my muscles are relaxed and I'm enjoying this music.<br>
<br>
(10:24) T+0:33 – Parachuted .5mg more.<br>
<br>
(10:51) T+1:00 – A really nice chilled feeling on my skin, kind of like euphoria. Really relaxed. My usual psychomotor agitation has gone down dramatically, if its even there. For me its usually chewing my tongue and moving around my leg. This is a very gentle drug.<br>
<br>
(11:06) T+1:15 – Very relaxed, I've heard that nicotine may diminish the effect of lorazepam. I'm going to go find out. I was on my way out but noticed some effects that I should report, in case I forget them. Walking is nice, every step feels soft. It's not that I'm unbalanced, it's just a fluid motion. My eyes are starting to become slightly lazy, and in the mirror I look very satisfied. Effects are good. But, my dog needs walking.<br>
<br>
(11:39) T+1:33 – Whilst walking my dog I felt that I should also experiment with a few other things. I took 6-7 hits from my pipe, no cannabis, I was hitting the resin. I have a moderate tolerance to cannabis (4-5 bowls a day, high quality). From there I felt the cannabis high was enhanced from the lorazepam. Best way to describe it is the feeling you get in your mouth from a mint, I feel that on my arms and legs. When I got back into the house, I figured that if I drink a small glass of wine, that too can enhance the experience. I know alcohol + benzos usually equal death, but those are severe cases. I'll now slowly consume my wine. <br>
<br>
(11:51) T+2:00 – I just noticed a sense of warmth and euphoria going over me. The lorazepam still has effects (they don't seem to be diminished by nicotine, although pharmacologically they are, subjectively they aren't (for me). My body is a lot more loose and music is really nice. My balance isn't in good shape. I think I'll wait a few more minutes to make sure I'm in an okay state, then I'll go drink another glass of wine. <br>
<br>
(12:23) T+2:32 – I measured out 80ml of my wine which is 13.5%. So that means I have 10.8 ml of alcohol in my glass. I finished it in one sip. Currently my cannabis-resin-high has gone down a tad. The psychological effects of lorazepam (relaxtion, no OCD, no anxiety!) are very strong. The minty feeling has gone down a bit. My balance is a little poor, but I can walk a straight line. I'm having very slight vertigo. So far on the Shulgin scale this could be a +2, though I really hate using the Shulgin scale on substances which aren't psychedelic. The effects are definitely here, I can act normal and be fine in front of authority if I needed to, or I could sit here moving my limbs to music and close my eyes to enjoy this euphoria at midnight. My stomach is showing slight disturbance, I have a slight headache that is quickly being killed with the alcohol. My eyes are a tiny bit blood shot and eye lids are droopy.<br>
<br>
(12:34) T+2:43 – I'm going out for another cigarette, more cannabis resin.<br>
<br>
(1:00) T+3:09 – I took 6 cannabis resin hits, I drank 10.8ml more of alcohol, smoked one cigarette, and its been 3 hours since I took the lorazepam. The cannabis high has definitely risen, although my euhproia is a very good mix of lorazepam, alcohol, and cannabis. The lorazepam is by no means overpowered by any of the other substances. Each is providing a very unique high. Music is great, I can feel it. My back and sides have a very warm euphoric feeling, yet the top of my head, arms and legs seem to be liking the lorazepam euphoria more. The alcohol is making my stomach feel nice, and head a tad fuzzy. The alcohol is affecting me more than I thought it should (I have a low tolerance, but one nonetheless). As much as I've drank would usually have me at a low buzz. My body is numb. So currently:<br>
<br>
I think that the interaction of the lorazepam and cannabis provide a very good feel to music, and an extremely pleasant body high. It even feels good to move. My skin has that mint feeling, but slightly. <br>
<br>
The interaction of the lorazepam with alcohol provide an interesting mix, my balance is definitely off, I can walk a straight line though. My movements are very fluid. The only negative thing I feel is that the fuzziness of alcohol is fucking with the mental effects of lorazepam. I still feel care-free, no worry/anxiety/no OCD, but my thinking is definitely as not as clear as it was with lorazepam.<br>
<br>
The interaction of lorazepam and nicotine was nice. I enjoyed sitting under the moon at midnight, feeling a fair breeze. I do not think that the nicotine has detracted from the lorazepam. At least not enough to make sure I don't smoke. If that makes sense.<br>
<br>
All together: I have slight vertigo, no headache, low breathing rate, my pulse is 103/min, my eyes are droopy, bloodshot. My mouth is wet, and everything else on my body is fine.  It's now 1:14, so I'm going to wait a bit and later take more wine, more cannabis.<br>
<br>
(1:38) T3:47 – The peak of the benzo should be ending soon, then the come down. I at this time drank 1 tablespoon of Nyquil, which is 15mg of dextromethorphan, and 6.5mg of doxylamine. This is a low dosage, I know, but considering I've drank more than 20 ml of alcohol, and 2mg of lorazepam, I'm hoping it'll have some synergy effect, and if its at a low enough intensity I'll take another dose.<br>
<br>
Right now my blood pressure is 117/70, pulse 84. So my pulse lowered along with everything else. I think its safe to consume 2 more doses of DXM/Doxylamine. And 5 mL of alcohol. I'll also go smoke a cigarette.<br>
<br>
(2:58) T+5:07 – I did those 2 doses of DXM/Doxylamine. At 1:38, with 5ML of alcohol at the same time. I went out for a walk, I smoked a cigarette while watching the city from a nearby hill. Then I went to the local store to get a pack of cigarettes. I got back just now at 2:58 and took 2 doses of DXM/doxylamine. Now I'm sitting behind my computer again, typing.<br>
<br>
Well... very strong body high. It's kind of like the DXM high, but minty and my balance is completely off thrown. I saw some blue lights flying around, and I'm have moderate vertigo. I smoked like 3 cigarettes before I got back. <br>
<br>
(3:08) T+5:17 – Lorazepam is wearing off, I can barely feel it. The resin cannabis finally overpowered it. The alcohol effects are there minus the euphoria, which currently is a mix of lorazepam, cannabis, and DXM/doxylamine. I'm getting a tad drowsy, my stomach isn't feeling that good, (its fine, but small gurgles in there). I'm starting to feel a tad weak, I'm experiencing ataxia too.<br>
<br>
(3:22) T+5:29 – It hit me fast. I'm really tired right now, I might go to bed or I might lay here for awhile, regardless, farewell reader. I'll finish this tomorrow. Horrible dry mouth.<br>
<br>
The next day I was slightly tired, and my stomach hurt a bit. This experience wasn't one to repeat, it was accidental. I started out wanting to just see if smoking cigarettes lowers the effects of benzos, but ended up doing a lot more than I originally planned. But, in the end, I learned that....they don't lower the subjective effects. <br>
