I took it without really knowing the true possible outcomes... I thought I would just feel like I was rolling and see cool shapes however it began with an extremely intense rolling sensation.  I first realized that I would be really fucked up soon when I was in the bathroom (lights off but door open leaving enough light to see a clear reflection) standing in front of the mirror and I thought I was looking in my purse at stuff.  I realized I wasn't holding my purse and it was on my friends bed.  WTF?  But it didn't freak me out, I just thought it was somewhat comical and typical for someone who at times experiences skitzo feelings when really fucked up.  <br>
<br>
I eventually took a shower but this was the beginning of the worst part of the trip.  The bathroom had a large mirror and a tub with a shower.  I began to hallucinate for real at this point.  I was in the shower and suddenly I began to notice the water on the wall so intensely the drops were so vivid and the ceiling morphed into an unsymmetrical form.  The whole bathroom wasn't a square anymore but shaped more like a fun-house.  For some reason my body felt like it was being forced into a spiral.  I stood up and spun to my right where I was standing as if I couldn't control it.  Even my hands and feet were aimed to the right and until I truly took notice that I could control them I finally just sat down so I wouldn't feel 'the force' anymore.  (Later on my friend said he felt a similar force when he took one that night).  <br>
<br>
Note that the lights were on in the bathroom... while I was sitting I really started to hallucinate.  When I breathed in it looked as if everything turned black or darker around me and while my arms were more white it was like I could see my all my veins in my body and they were dark.  When I breathed out everything turned white, almost blinding.  I breathed in and out like that maybe for a minute or so and I felt like the shower was turning evil on me.  I tried to turn off the faucets and shower but kept fumbling until finally I figured it out but the shower was as if it was telling me to get out and commanded so right as the water stopped. I feared for a while that I was turning evil somehow and was unsure if I could return to my 'normal' mental state.   <br>
<br>
I sat there for a minute but I couldn't analyze anything because each second something new was occurring... some visualization or feeling.  The 'bad trip' was only about 1/5 of the whole experience though.<br>
<br>
I finally got out and after talking to my sober friend who told me to stop 'having a bad trip' I finally began to enjoy the more popularized outcomes of it.  The carpet had an amazing pattern on it and I saw colors in various places all over the rooms.  I was somewhat incoherent to other people but at least my bad trip was over.  <br>
<br>
My friend drove me around and across this really long bridge.  I felt so small in my car and as if I was practically flying over the water.  I pictured my friend as some sort of fun character and we rode around in my car like it was some funmobile or something.  <br>
<br>
My trip lasted almost 8 hours start to finish... It was like rolling in that the effects began to come and go and diminished over time. I enjoyed the experience but probably won't do it again because it was pretty intense.<!-- End Body -->
