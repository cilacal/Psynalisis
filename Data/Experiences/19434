One night I felt like staying up the whole night, so I took 5 Adderall pills that I had and ground them up and snorted them. Well this got me tweaked like hell! An hour later I decided to see what would happen if I drank some Valerian Root Liquid Extract. I drank 1/2 of the bottle, and somewhere on the label it says that it contains 1 fluid ounce, so thats half ounce for me. <BR>
<BR>
After like 20 minutes I began to feel relaxed, not sleepy (the Adderall fixed that), and imaginative. I noticed that when I closed my eyes the most profound thing happened. I would be transported into another dimension! Its not like daydreaming, its like crystal clear colors and pictures and people! I also noticed that I would talk (mentally) to people who would answer back without me being able to control anything that they said! They would talk to me, and I would actually 'hear' their voices. Very interesting thing. <BR>
<BR>
Also when I would close my eyes, the open-eyed world became dim, I would try to recall information about it, but I could only remember the basics: that it was dark, and that I was in my room. Nothing else could be remembered until I opened my eyes. But it is very amazing to note that every 'hallucination' had a mind of its own! I could not control them, they would do what they would normally do, A biker would bike, A book would show pictures that wouldnt change! That was a great experience and I hope to try it again sometime, but not soon because I need to first get rid of my addiction to Adderall.<!-- End Body -->
