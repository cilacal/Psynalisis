I recently came across a fairly new research chemical that I had never heard of before, and not having done a hallucinogen in many years (at least three), I decided to give it a try. Though I am a 24-year-old graduate student in organic chemistry, I still only remember the drug by the name 25-I (though I can draw it). As a man of science should, I took it upon myself to record my experience in an effort to convince myself that I was doing 'research'. Before I transcribe the records from that fateful experience (I took notes), allow me to summarize perhaps the most interesting things that I took from my experience:<br/>
<br/>
Being diagnosed with schizoaffective disorder about five and a half years ago, I was prepared for the worst when I decided to partake in this 'research' (but expecting the best, of course). To my pleasant surprise, rather than aggravating my symptoms (that have pretty much gone away in the years following anyway, thanks to mindful practice), my mind was quiet when I wasn't thinking thoughts or music for the duration of the trip. Thought patterns were fairly normal, but more creative than usual, as one would expect when taking something with this type of reputation. I was still able to do simple arithmetic in my head fairly quickly and the majority of my thoughts were related to science. I did neglect to do my homework, though. <br/>
<br/>
I made an impulse decision to smoke Cannabis at t+420 minutes, on the dot, which I haven't done by myself in at least a year, and, though I thought more, I still was not troubled by 'others' thoughts' as I sometimes am on Cannabis. The trip lasted for about ten hours, but the last half was more mild and relaxing than 'trippy'. Not a whole lot of visuals, but definitely distortions. I was trying to play my guitar for about an hour before I went to bed, but was mostly just mesmerized by the interference patterns of the vibrating strings.<br/>
<br/>
Without further ado, here are the minutes that I recorded with comments in double parentheses:<br/>
<br/>
T-5: ate peanut butter, banana, honey, 2 slices whole grain bread<br/>
T+0: 1 blot (~800 mcg?)  ((There's no way it was 800 mcg))<br/>
T+10: swallow, bitter<br/>
T+15: a bit off-kilter<br/>
T+35: pull, slight nausea<br/>
T+45: pull, slight nausea, slight dilation<br/>
T+50: nicotine, flickering periphery<br/>
T+60: false enhance<br/>
T+90: waves<br/>
T+100: Bluete ((referring to Blutech, I felt like part of the music))<br/>
T+127: Good level, would do again, full dilation<br/>
T+148: Maybe this is real life<br/>
T+205: Ate food, tasted good, riding~~ ((fried tofu, sriracha, one egg))<br/>
T+229: Today my trajectory passed a fair few, but it is now spiraling in solitude, as it is. Tea. TMX ((trimethylxanthine))<br/>
[Wavy sinusoid]--233<br/>
T+238: Bliss<br/>
T+298: First records of a new language<br/>
T+300: Ying, Shua ((two characters for each, pairs of counterforces))<br/>
T+360: In tune ((Had previously drank one craft beer))<br/>
T+420: -.- ((high face))<br/>
T+440: ((music note))<br/>
T+608: Tired ((after playing guitar))<br/>
T~660: sleep, 'normal' dreams<br/>
<br/>
More minutes were recorded as pictures on another sheet of paper, but unfortunately I cannot upload it here.<br/>
<br/>
Overall: go into it with good expectations, don't overdo it, and you will have a great time!<!-- End Body -->
