This was my fourth experience with 4-HO-MiPT, though it's my first time making a trip report about it here. I had used it previously at 20, 25, and 30 mg, and at all of these doses I had found it to be a subtle psychedelic, producing a mixed body load with euphoria but also some muscle tension and nausea without any very significant psychological effects aside from empathy and only mild waving visuals around the borders of objects or textures. My favorite thing about it so far had been the way it enhanced my imagination, making it much more colorful and erotic, so I was wondering if this effect would increase to something more overt at 50 mg. Much to my surprise, it seemed that the drug had something very different in store for me.<br/>
<br/>
My previous experience with psychedelics includes Psilocybe cubensis, Ipomoea tricolor, Argyreia nervosa, bufotenin, DMT, LSD, 2C-B, 2C-I, DOC, 4-AcO-DMT, 4-HO-MET, 4-AcO-MET, 4-HO-DET, 4-AcO-DET, 4-HO-MPT, 4-HO-DPT, 4-HO-MiPT, 4-HO-DiPT, 4-AcO-DALT, MiPT, DiPT, DALT, and at least a couple of unidentified things.<br/>
<br/>
Unfortunately, unlike my previous trip reports, I did not manage to take any notes with timestamps this time around. To be honest, I was nowhere near expecting the intensity of this trip which was several times greater than at 30 mg, not a linear dose response at all. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">I was nowhere near expecting the intensity of this trip which was several times greater than at 30 mg, not a linear dose response at all.</div></div> For that reason I went into it expecting to be able to just take notes casually, but I ended up becoming so immersed in the experience that that just never happened. Consequently, I will have to describe this trip entirely from memory, so please forgive me if anything has escaped me now.<br/>
<br/>
It was early in the morning and I had the apartment to myself, and I had the desire to take something psychedelic. I had 4-HO-DET lined up for my next really heavy trip, but I wasn't really looking for that kind of experience this time around. I figured that since 30 mg of 4-HO-MiPT had still been completely lucid for me, 50 mg shouldn't be that hard to handle alone (haha). I weighed it out, dumped it in a gel capsule, and down the hatch it went.<br/>
<br/>
Most notable to me at first was that the capsule seemed to drastically slow down the onset from how I'm used to eating it just straight; I'd normally feel that kicking in hard within about fifteen to twenty minutes, but this time at about an hour I was honestly starting to wonder if the chemical had somehow degraded despite the fact that it still looked completely white. However, just as I was having these thoughts, I moved my hand and there they were: tracers, tracers, and tracers of tracers. They went from nothing to almost blinding, creating too many copies to see through the spaces of, stacking upon each other, and just floating in front of me wherever I tried to look. I started to become anxious that I had gotten myself into more than I had prepared for, and I stood up to try to gauge my situation. As I did so the floor pulled down into itself as if I was heavily dissociated, and it became clear to me just how hard this was hitting me as I began to feel the clarity about my situation or past memories starting to slip away as well.<br/>
<br/>
So far the intensity of the detachment that it was hitting me with was comparable to the same dose of 4-HO-MPT, but I had been in a better situation to let go at that time then I was now, and my gut told me that I should do something to cut the intensity just a little bit. I ended up taking a few sips of wine as the trip was still reaching its full peak, and it did nothing to hinder the intensity of the sensory overload, but it did help me stay a little more lucid and relaxed than I had been before. About that sensory overload though, things were really starting to go crazy. There was still surprisingly few open eye visuals for me at this point aside from the aforementioned tracers and the now quite heavy waving of all surfaces, but they made for a powerfully disorienting combination, and at the same time my audio perceptions were actually heavily distorted as well and echoed to a point that it was extremely difficult to tell what was or was not happening around me, especially outside where I could hear but not see things. It was also very difficult for me to enjoy any bodily euphoria which was occurring at that point because I was also getting some gastrointestinal distress which was intensified to the point that my I just felt really physically twisted up and uncomfortable. It was a hard peak, but I knew it would pass eventually, so I tried to make the most of it.<br/>
<br/>
I closed my eyes for a bit and noticed that there was light tryptamine hyperspatial imagery unfolding, of a similar to style to what I have also experienced on 4-HO-MET and 4-HO-MPT, but less vivid or developed. It was interesting to see, but not enough to keep me captivated for more than a moment. While staring around the room with eyes open I was eventually able to make some geometric patterning emerge as well, transparent but detailed, which was again similar to but less complex than those other two tryptamines. Notably, those two both also include vivid imagery of faces and things like vines among their geometry when it is this active, but 4-HO-MiPT was lacking for me in this way. Probably the most interesting visual effect it did have for me was that it produced sort of a 'mind's eye visual' I have also gotten from 4-HO-DET and 4-HO-MPT, one which starts with a 'twisted tunnel' geometric effect that is brightly colored in a way that reminds me of meditation-induced out-of-body experiences, and it has led to those types of visionary effects on the others, but did not reach that intensity this time. However, despite the visual simplicity of it, I believe that this combined with the fact that it took me to that point at all is still just another great example of its subtle power.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from the visual effects, there was a very typically psychedelic mindset that had me thinking overly emotionally about many different aspects of life, which would have been fantastic if it were the kind of thing I was looking for. I believe that 4-HO-MiPT, at least the way it works in me, would likely make an excellent ally to anyone who is currently using psychedelics in order to have these kinds of philosophical thoughts and new perspectives, but at the moment I don't really feel that that is what I need out of tripping. Most of the thoughts that I had were just review of things I've thought through before and already started integrating into my life in a more levelheaded fashion. But, I suppose it was a good reminder of some things.<br/>
<br/>
Eventually, once the sensory overload finally started to die down, things started to get easier and nicer. My somatic discomfort went away and was replaced by a general numbness and the occasional feeling of energized euphoria. Strangely, despite one very interesting fantasy I had that did not really seem outside the realm of what any tryptamine could do, I had no particularly erotic effects from 4-HO-MiPT this time around. I did however have some good tactile enhancement, and taking a hot bath turned out to be a wonderfully blissful experience. I stayed in there for a good while just thinking about the trip and how it effected me and what choices I am making in my life right now, and I didn't get out until it finally started to get a little cold on me. I had a similar dissociated feeling to when I first stood up hit me once I got out of the water too, reminding me of just how altered I really still was, even though I seemed to mostly be thinking and perceiving rationally again.<br/>
<br/>
In the mid afternoon my roommate got home from work, and at this point I started happily discussing the trip with him. I was also in the process of taking out the trash when he arrived, and should note that the outside world was beautiful, but very, very bright. Anyway though, after my roommate got settled in he decided to put on one of his favorite show's musical episodes, and as soon as the TV first came on I noticed something suspicious: the startup sounds did not sound like the correct notes. I waited for the episode to start up, and sure enough, the main actress's voice was shifted downward in pitch, and the instrumentals sounded just slightly wrong. Having just experienced this on my previous trip sixteen days ago, I immediately recognized this as the same sort of audio distortion that is produced by DiPT. No wonder sounds were so hard to understand earlier on on top of all the other psychedelic distortions!<br/>
<br/>
We finished watching the show about seven hours after I had initially dosed, and by that time her voice and other sounds had returned to normal. My roommate and I had been smoking cannabis slowly since he arrived and this had pumped up some of the patterning and stimulation from before as well, but we had stopped part of the way into the episode and now I was feeling mostly down, aside from a lingering body high. I considered this to be the effective end to the experience, and stopped trying to find more effects afterward.<br/>
<br/>
In the end, I thought this was a fascinating experience, but I have little to no desire to repeat it. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">I thought this was a fascinating experience, but I have little to no desire to repeat it.</div></div> As I said, the headspace is simply not what I am looking for the most right now, and the intensity of it is something that I can appreciate just after this one go with it, and I can get stronger visuals of a similar nature with other tryptamines that I prefer more. Actually, I was quite surprised that 50 mg of 4-HO-MiPT did not even manage to be as hallucinogenic as the same amount of MiPT for me. But, despite that, I can still appreciate it for being the very powerful psychedelic that it is, and as I mentioned, I do think that it would be a wonderful tool for what it's good for. The whole head trip reminded me very much of both mushrooms and 4-HO-DiPT, very emotional and intellectual in that way.<br/>
<br/>
I only have enough 4-HO-MiPT left for one less than 50 mg dose, and I suspect that this may be my last opportunity to try it unless it just happens to find me again. I have to say though that I find the lower dose effects to be much more enjoyable and positive on my mind, so I am excited to save it for when the time is right and give this chemical the proper send off it deserves. This is a psychedelic that is subtle enough to be nearly as social as MDMA for me at lower doses and ego crushing on a level comparable to LSD and 4-HO-MPT for me at higher doses, and that is something I think is quite an accomplishment. Treat it with respect, and it will respect you back.<!-- End Body -->
