<br/>
I consider myself a psychonaut and have experienced many mind-altering drugs in the past: psilocybin, MDMA, DXM, LSD, Ketamine, Meth, Cocaine, 5-MeO-DMT, Salvia to name just a few. It makes me a better person. It started with curiosity, and now I am bored with the sober life. I have probably done MDMA 200 ~ 400 times, I would do all kinds from street quality (meth / MDA / acid)) to crystal MDMA, I average 2-3 pills per trip, and my frequency various – in 10 years time, I’ve done MDMA as seldom as twice a year to 3 times a week. MDMA makes me a better person. But I become the introvert and pessimist after the effects where off as my peers, or it seems they become the regular dude without ultimate empathy. The trouble is I am getting older and can feel the intense comedown for at least 12 hours. Moreover, it just looses magic and the symptoms are very uncomfortable. I’ve come across pharmaceuticals and these have given up psychedelic experiences for the most part because the benzodiazepines in particular the Tramadol and Valium hinder a once euphoric trip. I often feel there may be conflicts with my neurotransmitter. In fact, a couple times I felt I had “mild” serotonin syndrome, and enough to repel me from rolling because it is uncomfortable. I am addicted to Valium and Tramadol, and somewhat Soma for 2.5 years (daily). The trade off was not a good deal because I have physical / psychological problems versus living dangerously. I have countless combination and my doses have been low enough to taper off and times I binge, I have taken a higher dose (and more substances) in times I take like there’s no tomorrow. I will just take what I feel is a common “conservative” experience. <br/>
<br/>
T : 0:00 - I took the benzos and Tramadol first as they kick in at about the same time. (I believe the benzos help prevent the potential seizures that high doses Tramadol can bring on). I go downstairs to make a meal knowing I will soon take certain substances that will go together nicely. Due to my tolerance, I just feel a slight sense of well being and more excited as I will take soma and Kratom to achieve a comfortable synergetic effect.<br/>
<br/>
T :  0:30 - I take two fat tablespoons of decent Kratom to increase the effects of the opioid. The taste is not overwhelmingly bad, but I feel that Kratom is weak and prefer to chase with a think beverage (e.g. coffee, fruit juice). I quickly take Soma, a music relaxant. While I have taken more that 2500 mg in one shot, I am always careful to not exceed this too often as this is probably the most dangerous drugs of all I ingesting. Now I await the feeling that resembles a mild MDMA without the comedown. <br/>
<br/>
T : 0:45 I go outside and smoke a bowl a decent quality weed. Within five minutes, I feel a nice mild head change. Not too overwhelming but definitely stoned and very wobbly at this point.<br/>
 <br/>
T : 1:00 - I’m drinking a Corona (not my favorite, but that’s all I had. I take my time to drink (about 20 minutes a beer) understanding that alcohol can cause unpredictable effects when mixed with the drugs like benzos and Soma. After finishing the beer, I feel so good that I drink another. At this point, my eyes are in the back of my head. I would describe this as mildly rolling but very much in control unlike even a mild dose of MDMA. If I try not to control, I catch myself feeling cozy and nodding off. The difference is with a liberal dose on Tramadol, I can perform well in a job interview whereas with a moderate dose of good MDMA you may still have trouble no matter what you tolerance is. Tramadol is different than opiates like Vicodin and Oxycontin because it lasts longer, the euphoria is mellow but much longer, I have more “mellow” energy and passion, and my thinking and judgment is not clouded. <br/>
<br/>
T: 1:30 - I am not into alcohol too much despite deliberate efforts to see if I could be. Apparently, at this point, it is not my favorite. I have good discipline when it comes to alcohol, but not for Ultram and Soma combination. The intention I have is to mimic a pseudo-MDMA like high, although MDMA is much more euphoric.  I feel the Soma very nicely, but am not tired. I feel intoxicated in a good way versus someone whom might purge. I rarely ever get sick on Ultram no matter the dosage -- I’m not sure if that’s a good thing. Other opiates that I enjoy 10% of the time without any pattern will make me nauseous, albeit the euphoria is much more intense. However, I can not only function on Ultram, but I am nicer and empathize with people in even professional settings due to the milder buzz. The Soma is something completely opposite unless my dose is light.<br/>
<br/>
T: 3:00 - The effects are good, but I fear the alcohol diminished the experience. I take an extra 0.5 mg Valium (not overdoing it as I eventually want to get off this medicine) followed by 2 more Soma pills. Perhaps I can sleep.<br/>
<br/>
Conclusion : Benzodiazepines, Ultram and Soma are a great combination. Just be careful since benzodiazepines can be more addicted that opiates (including Heroin). I take Valium as a safety precaution, but because I am aware how dangerous the physical addiction is, I usually try not to take too much. The alcohol may not be a stellar idea, and sometimes even cannabis can curtail the mellow euphoria I’m seeking. The advantage of taking trams with soma versus ecstasy is there is not hard come down.<br/>
<br/>
I know in reading this, you’ll probably think that I can be a better person without substances, but I’ve tried with no success. Besides missing them, I just feel that I am more outgoing and productive, ironically. It should be noted that earlier in the day, I took Ultram, Soma and Valium in my modest daily dose not seeking intoxication but normalcy.<!-- End Body -->
