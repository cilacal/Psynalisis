So, 2 years ago I was addicted to Vivarin, real bad.  There was a dollar store near me that sold it 200 for a $1.  It was insane, and there was just so much of it.  <BR>
<BR>
One night, I decide to take 20 at once.  I had to, I had homework and studying to do, but why 20? Who knows?  I finished all my homework way earlier than planned and it was 4 AM and I had nothing to do.  So, I popped in Pulp Fiction in my VCR.  About an hour into it, I started getting these sharp pains in my stomach.  I ran to do the bathroom not knowing if I was gonna shit or vomit.  I sat down and closed my eyes trying to forget everything.  Then it happened.<BR>
<BR>
I heard 2 voices from the other side of my bathroom door.  I started thinking, who the fuck is out there.  It's 5 AM, and everyone as far as I know is sleeping.  I listen more and more intently, and I realize it is Samuel L. Jackson & John Travolta from Pulp Fiction.  Soon, I come to the realization that they must be here to kill me.  They are hitmen, that's what they do.  I started to freak out, I refused to open the door for them, even though they were pounding on it and asking to come in.  I got so scared that I thought they might just shoot through the door and kill me.  So, I got into my shower, being the only thing not in front of the door and curled up with my hands over my head.  <BR>
<BR>
I passed out in there and my mom came to wake me up at 7:30 for school.  She asked me what I was doing in there, and I said, 'I guess I was sleepwalking.'  She left and I just sat there thinking about what had happened.  I really got what it feels like to have your life threatened.  I don't know if it was a good or bad experience, but I do know I never took that many caffei pills again.<!-- End Body -->
