I purchased 200g of Blue lotus from an online vendor. I was quite excited to try this new substance. I had tried many substances that I believed would be similar to it, marijuana, salvia, wild dagga ect but all of these are quite different to lotus in actuality.<br>
<br>
I had just finished my exams and I tried to stay clean while taking them (for obvious reasons) so on the day I finished I was determined to get really high and clear out some of the information that would not be necessary ever again.<br>
<br>
At around 7.50 I took out some of the petals that I had grinded earlier that week, it totaled around 20-30g by my guess. This is considerably more than any report I have read before so I believed this would be good. <br>
<br>
After 40 mins I came back to the percolator which held the 20-30gs of blue lotus and two mugs of water in it. I poured this brown liquid into a big bottle, I tasted the brew, it was sour and tasted reminiscent of what I believe a bark and dirt mixture would be. I added 5gs of sugar to this and it quickly became a pleasant drink, one which I could drink easily within three minutes. <br>
<br>
Fifteen minutes past and although in the back of my mind there was the feeling that there were some effects starting it was incredibly subtle and I wasn´t sure whether the petals were even real or not.<br>
<br>
I sat down on the sofa and watched some television. After another ten minutes I could really feel some effects, I was watching a cartoon and it seemed to be traveling at a strange speed, way too fast, pictures flashing in front of me becoming more vivid and drawing me into the set. This was a hypnotic and pleasant feeling, quite disorientating though.<br>
<br>
I ran up to my room and grabbed a beer, I heard that drinking and lotus synergized well so I gave it a go. After the tea I found the beer easily downable, it tasted quite diluted and I finished within a minute. <br>
<br>
I returned to the TV set and continued watching sitcoms and cartoons. A hypnotic and sedated feeling spread across my body and this lasted another 15 minutes or so. Then the synergy of the alcohol began to be noticeable, there was a lucidity and an amplification of the hypnotic feeling in my body.<br>
<br>
The strange part of the experience was the fact that my mind was sedated yet strangely aware and capable of mental processes. My body however was still working perfectly, I could stand and walk straight though while walking any lights did seem to leave trails as I moved my head. I felt a bit off balance but not really dizzy.<br>
<br>
I went to my room again and since I wanted to keep the feeling going I grabbed my bong, did about 8 hits getting through about four grams of lotus, I had tried smoking lotus on its own before but without drinking some lotus tea it does nothing.<br>
<br>
After smoking the lotus the experience changed again. Now I did feel quite strong euphoric feelings and great feelings of wellbeing. I was sedated and calm, with slight euphoria. It wasn´t like MDMA euphoria, it was less naive and potent than that, it was the inner peaceful kind, a wise kind of fulfilled euphoria. Not a heavy drug that gets me stoned out of my mind inexplicably, a subtle yet complex, enlightening and fun trip.<br>
<br>
It was a very cerebral high and any buzz in my head was definitely radiating from the top of my head. My eyelids felt heavy and I did begin to feel tired, very tired.<br>
<br>
A great and ever changing, metamorphic high that is only held back by the fact that its effects do not last very long, by 11.00 I was baseline again.<br>
<br>
P.S.     I almost vomited when I tried to eat the pulp from the percolator after drinking the beer. It was extremely distasteful and had a nasty texture.<!-- End Body -->
