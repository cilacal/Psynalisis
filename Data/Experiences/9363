On friday, at about 3:30, my girlfriend, lets call her T, put some AMT powder on a cd case.  She made 3 even piles, and Me, T and our friend M all licked our fingers and ate our piles.  I was prepared for this trip, I researched the drug for 5 days, and I was in a fairly good mood, and I was slightly apprehensive.<BR>
<BR>
T hated the taste of the shit, her ex boyfriend got her to snort it a week before, which I find slightly repulsive.  I didnt mind the taste at all, although it wasnt anywhere near a taste i would describe as good.  We were going to Lake George and an amusment park called great escape.  We got to great escape around 4:45, and we were all feeling the effects at that point.  I felt the feeling I get after taking 2 ephedrine's and working out, a general sense of happiness and power.  Great Escape was close due to this home school day, and they wouldnt let us in even though we have season passes.  Bullshit.<BR>
<BR>
We drove to the village of Lake George, where they had this car show thing.  At that point I felt like I had taken ecstacy and 1 hit of acid.  We layed in the grass, I walked in the water and we walked around the village a little while.  we went in a haunted house that we hadnt been in before and people jumped out at us.  I found it entertaining, M was freaking out, which I thought was freaking pathetic.  It was not a scary haunted house.<BR>
My vision was messed up, the walls were wiggling.  It was interesting to me.<BR>
<BR>
At around 9 o clock I was tripping very hard.  I felt as though I had taken maybe 10 hits of acid and still 1 ecstacy.  I was loving it.  T was feeling sick so we went back to my car and sat there.  I turned on music and it made T felt better.  She gave me 'oral pleasure', and it felt amazing.  At about 10 we headed back to our own area, which was about 45 minutes away.  T kept feeling to cold then too hot, and I was OK.<BR>
<BR>
T threw up violently and thought she was gunna die, and kept saying she had flashbacks of when she snorted that shit. I cant remember how M felt, but I drove us to my sisters apartment.  After getting M the retard out of my car, we went inside.  We got situated, and I took a bonghit, and at that point I felt dumber.  I tried to relearn how to play magic the gathering and couldnt grasp it at all.  I was dumb.<BR>
<BR>
M kept going from room to room, unable to get comfortable.  I thought she was freaking out and it basically made the best trip of my life about half as good as it could have been.  T wanted to lay down in my sisters room so I layed with her.  We ended up having sex, and it felt just about as amazing as it can get.  I would never have come, but I didnt care because it felt INCREDIBLE.<BR>
<BR>
At one point as we layed in the dark, T's face looked like the guy who gave us the haunted house tour, but I knew she wasnt so I looked closer and she turned back to normal.  At about 2:30 I took M and T home, and then myself. <BR>
Me and T talked for a few hours, then I went to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
In conclusion, I personally, even with one person having a bad trip, and one feeling like shit, had a good experience with this drug.  I now know I can take as much acid as I want.  Visually, this drug gave nice effects, similar to acid, with things being twisty, brigther, things seemed to breathe, strangers seemed ugly, I had some hallucinations but I could tell what was reality and what wasnt.  I enjoyed music, but I didnt hear anything extra.<BR>
<BR>
I had 2 realizations:<BR>
<BR>
1. Drugs like this are bad, and this was a learning experience not to take drugs that can be harmful, like this.<BR>
<BR>
2.  I love my girlfriend more than anything in the whole world.<BR>
<BR>
And a new one just came to me:  My sister is there for me when I need her.  Tara resolved that she wont do any drugs anymore except drinking and smoking pot.  I got her to put it in writing.  Yesterday she decided she would also do acid, but 2 hits at the most.<!-- End Body -->
