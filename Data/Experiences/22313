After having a promising trip with 20mg:s of 5-MeO-DiPT, I had decided to dose again in a more flexible setting. I knew that a friend of mine had acquired some 5-MeO-DiPT, so I called him and asked if he could spare some. I ended up having two capsules, both of which were supposed to contain ten mgs of the substance. I wanted to know how the quantities were measured. <BR>
<BR>
I believe that the total amount of 5-MeO-DiPT consumed by me was actually a little more that 20mgs, because the intensity of the trip was significantly higher than with my first 20 mgs. This could also have been affected by the fact that I was feeling a bit restless at T-0:30.<BR>
<BR>
I took both of the capsules to an empty stomach with a glass of water at about 8pm. I then took about half an hour for the trip to take hold. Before that, I had experienced the kind of motion sickness I’ve noticed at the onset of a few psychedelics like 5-meo-dipt, LSA and oral DMT. The first significant effect was the general derangement of senses that mostly affected my hearing and seeing. Everything I heard had come through a flanger and was pitched down, just like with normal dipt-trips, but this time the effect seemed to be more violent, which started to scare me after a while.<BR>
<BR>
My vision had quickly turned surprisingly alien. Every straight line, like the corners of walls were waving and breathing.<BR>
<BR>
The familiar apartment now had green and red walls instead of the normal white ones. All loose objects like posters, curtains and houseplants seemed to be blown back and forth by a strong wind, as if there was a storm in the room. The aliens from a giger-style drawing on the wall began to turn their heads in different directions, and the head of a sheep from a poster was extruded from the painting, and after that it began to hover in the kitchen.<BR>
The visuals seemed to be refreshed very quickly compared to normal visuals caused my 5-meo-dipt, which are usually shown at a few frames per second.<BR>
<BR>
After about two hours I was peaking. I had spent the hour before the peak just sitting still on a sofa and wishing the effects wouldn't grow any stronger, but they never stopped increasing.<BR>
<BR>
The peak was the most interesting part of the trip. I began to have visions that were comparable with those caused by salvia divinorum.<BR>
<BR>
This means that the location of perception can't anymore be placed, for example, on a single sense. I had glimpses of huge buildings with hundreds of lit windows and blue ascending towers that reached the skies. This all happened during an indeterminable amount of time, but my trip sitter later told me that at about this time I was turning around rapidly and breathing more heavily than usual.<BR>
<BR>
Another unique quality I noticed was that I seemed to disappear from reality whenever certain frequencies of breathing or positions of my body were met. When I lied on the sofa I noticed that it felt so comfortable it somehow 'wasn't right' anymore. I couldn't feel my body parts separately, I just that felt that there was a body down there and that I was something else, somewhere else. This, however, was not as intense as it may sound now - at that time it just felt very reasonable. After the peak my tripsitter/dj played a live version of 'pushit' by Tool. The table drumming by Aloke Dutta and the subsequent guitar part sent me into a kind of void - the sound seemed to fill my perception with bright visualization.<BR>
<BR>
I continued to have weird ideas of frequencies and resonance long into the evening. I also has looping voices in my head, but they're not worth mentioning here because they were in my native language.<BR>
<BR>
The trip was definitely psychedelic and very hallucinogenic. My experience, I’m glad to say, was in the latter category.<!-- End Body -->
