I recently got a hold of some 2C-E from a chemical distributor and I decided to try it out.  I am a very experienced tryptamine user, but this is the first time I've experimented with a phenethylamine.  I've read tons of stories and experience reports on 2C-B, 2C-T-7, 2C-I, etc. and I decided to give it a go in the 20mg - 30mg range. <BR>
<BR>
I measured out exactly 25mg of the luminous powder with my digital scale, put it in a capsule, and swallowed it.  I then drank a 24 oz. can of pineapple juice (no joke).  I smoked a bowl of weed and I started to clean my room.  I guess this is when I'll start the T+ list...<BR>
<BR>
T+0:30 - While cleaning the room, I start feeling a little chilly.  It soon turns into chills that come and go in ten minute intervals.  I walk around the house and make sure the house isn't just cold, realize that it isn't, and decide to take a shower.  Not feeling too much in terms of a psychedelic so far, but I definately feel a 'cold feet' situation going on.  My palms are also slightly perspirating.<BR>
<BR>
T+1:00 - I'm in the shower and I have the lights turned off.  It is around 9:30 at night, so it's completely dark in the shower.  I always trip at night and I always get in the dark shower at around the T+0:45 point.  While in the shower, I stare at my surroundings and I can usually tell if the chemical I've taken is affecting me at this point or not.  My eyes never became adjusted to the darkness, so I could never see any objects.  I stayed in the shower for about thirty minutes, then got out.<BR>
<BR>
T+1:30 - Upon turning the lights on, I notice some strange fractal sensations and some 'tracers' for about five seconds.  I turn the light off again for about ten seconds, and turn it back on and notice the same effect.  Not too much going on, especially mentally, but my pupils are extremely dilated so I know that something's going on in the ol' noggin.<BR>
<BR>
T+1:45 - I go back to my room and listen to some music.  I've still got chills, so bad that I get goosebumps.  It's not really too annoying, I just feel like putting on a jacket.  I do so and realize that I'm also feeling really tired.  Not exhausted-like tired, just..  Mellow and lazy.  I smoke a bowl of weed again and then half of a cigarette, then lay on my bed with music playing.  I close my eyes for long periods of time, then open them and notice that I'm starting to get visuals of some nature.  Not too intense yet, but it's there.<BR>
<BR>
T+2:15 - I'm laying in my bed with my eyes close and I feel like I almost fell alseep, but then the left side of my head got really tingly and I heard a weird noise..  The best way I can describe it is like an electrical current being cut off.  I hear this twice, one lower in pitch than the other.  I start getting a bit anxious so I turn the lights off in my room but leave the monitor of my computer on.  When I stood up, I got an intense headrush and I almost fell down.  My head felt really tingly and I was getting intense tracers as well as swirling if I closed my eyes.  It looked like a collage of thumbprints swirling around as phosphenes in my eyes.  It gets so intense that it's hard to keep my eyes closed.<BR>
<BR>
T+2:45 - I definately know that I'm feeling this chemical.  The curtains are swaying back and forth, my posters are becoming really colorful and if I stare at them, they seem to almost come alive.  This substance seemed to take quite a while to show it's face, but I like what it's showing so far.  I'm not feeling stimulating at all.  As a matter of fact, I'm not feeling too many other physical sensations than being happy and 'content' with what's going on.  <BR>
<BR>
T+3:00 - Out of slight boredom with my room, I decide to walk around the block.  The trees are greeting me, branches are swirling around and coming towards me.  A weeping willow tree with no leaves looks like a bunch of snakes crawling up and down vertically in the air.  As I stare at the sky and move my head, I get intense tracers from the starts.  I'm starting to feel a 'buzzing' all over my body, yet still not stimulating.  I get a coke at the store (intense enhancement of colors inside the store) at then walk home.<BR>
<BR>
T+3:30 - I'm back to listening to music and smoking weed.  I have all of the lights turned out and my room is total darkness.  I can make out some of the outlining of my posters as well as objects in my room, but not very well at all.  IN the dark as I stare around the room, objects seem to get really close to me, and then really far away, very DXM-esque.  I don't feel dissociated at all, but I do feel a little isolated from my surroundings, especially in the darkness.  I laid on my bed and stare at my bedroom door.  The whole image in my vision of the room when up and disappeared, then came from the bottom of my vision and lined up again.  This almost freaked me out, but I was still feeling fairly calm.<BR>
<BR>
T+4:00 - I'm sure I've reached the peak and I'm having a good time.  Music sounds wonderful, 3D, and special.  I listen to some songs over and over again.  Time's going by really fast, yet it feels like it isn't.  Sounds kinda backwards, eh?  I make a greeting card for my girlfriend, a few Fruity Loop files, then relax some more.  The visuals are very intense, but I have almost no body feeling besides the buzz I mentioned earlier.  I am very happy about the subtleness of this compound.  Definately a different trip than tryptamines.  I can't even compare this to anything that I've tried in the tryptamine family, and I've experimented with everything from DPT freebase to 5-MeO-DET, not to mention 4-HO-DET, 4-Acetoxy-DiPT, and, of course, DMT and 5-MeO-DMT.  Nothing in the tryptamine family is as subtle as this.  Nothing that I've seen yet.<BR>
<BR>
T+5:00 - 12:00 - I listen to music, smoke weed, and look around my room at the beautiful colors and patterns.  Time went by incredibly fast and I'm at the 12-hour point in no time.  I'm sure I reached a +++ experience on the Shulgin scale, but the mental distortions were not there..  at all.  This isn't a bad thing.  I thought I was going to feel the prolonged stimulating effect such as AMT, 5-MeO-DiPT, etc. but I don't.  The trip subsides very nice and I easily fall asleep to some very lucid dreams.  A very good chemical to work with.  <BR>
<BR>
From what I've learned after this experience, there's a very steep dosage/respose curve.  25mg produces very interesting visual effects, yet 30mg causes some pretty intense mental distortion, paranoia, etc.  The most I have done is 40mg and I feel no desire to go higher.  I could now compare 30mg of 2C-E to about two hits of LSD-25.  The effects are not identical or even very similar, but in terms of the Shulgin scale, each can cause some pretty rich +++ and possibly even ++++ experiences, depending on tolerance and vulnerability to these chemicals.  <BR>
<BR>
Being the first phenethylamine I've tried, I am very impressed.  I have absolutely nothing bad to say about this substance.  I soon hope to try other 2C-B analogues.  These chemicals are widely available FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES.  If in the wrong hands, I could see these substances becoming abused.  Let's try not to let that happen.  Take care of yourself, and as always, happy tripping.<!-- End Body -->
