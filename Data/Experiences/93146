So after gaining a bit of confidence in extractions and hearing about galangal I decided to give it a shot and try an extraction this is how I went about the process.<br>
<br>
Using the following;<br>
25g x3 Galangal<br>
25g x3 Lye<br>
250ml x3 water<br>
100ml x3 N-Heptane <br>
<br>
So I did an STB extraction with no knowledge on what the PH should be and put in far too little water as I didnt have adequate vessels to use, I had 3 separate jars with the intention of using different methods to see what I got as a final product. The results are as follows;<br>
<br>
'powder' so I agitated the three every few hours at the least, for about two days, then I siphoned the top layer of one jar to try a freeze precipitation.... Which failed, probably a given but lesson learned and we move on, the next step was to get all of the top layers and split them into two equal amounts in separate jars and add an equal portion of water with enough citric acid to take the PH to around 2. Agitated every couple of hours for two days then separated the two yet again to have one jar of N-heptane mix and one of Water/citric acid and the galangal. <br>
<br>
From this point I first evaporated the water mixture by placing it into a shallow glass tray and heating it at around 50 degrees Celsius, unfortunately not for long enough and when I harvested it, it was kinda gooey... But it worked! A friend volunteered to try it and I took notes which are as follows;<br>
<br>
<span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
One should not attempt to perform alkaloid extractions or other home chemistry without first having an understanding of safe handling, risks associated with different solvents, procedures, and equipment. Risks include burns, cancer, lung damage, flammability, and explosion.]</span><br>
<br>
10pm 1.25g<br>
Reported an onset around 45mins later.<br>
<br>
12AM<br>
Reports of, mental alertness, clarity of thought, feelings of ease and well being and quiet 'grounding' in reality.<br>
<br>
12:30AM 0.80g<br>
Time for another dose, this was to check if its ok to 'bump' up on and if so how much of a tolerance would have built, Slight increase of effect from previous state, enough to make it apparent that a double up of dose would put you at about the same level as before.<br>
<br>
2AM unknown quantity of JWH XXX<br>
Reports of a very calming feeling and definitively noticeable amalgamation of both the JWH and Galangal which were described as 'working together quiet well' with a grin and all :D <br>
<br>
At this point it was 4 hours from initial point of test, shortly after subject went to bed and the following day reported a relaxing sleep and some nice dreams.<br>
<br>
Smoke; the next test was to evaporate the N-Heptane mixture and get a freebase to test, which I did myself and my findings were as follows, I rolled up a tobacco cigarette with approximately 1ml of freebased Galangal on it, the effects were super subtle so I had the same amount again to minimal effect, I could feel something but barely noticeable.<br>
<br>
I have some more tests to try with what I have left and also looking at getting some more to try more assaying on, will update when I get the opportunity, in my opinion a good dose of 'powdered' Galangal would be upward of 4-6grams.<!-- End Body -->
