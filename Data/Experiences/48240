Before I begin I'd like to recommend that readers don't take the same path I did. First of all insufflating this chemical can have dire effects, second of all I took the chemical within hours of finding out it existed in the first place.  <span class='erowid-warning'>[Erowid Note: 
The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]</span> <br>
<br>
At my previous place of employment, a fellow worker asked if I enjoyed hallucinogens. Not one to lie about such a subject dear to my heart and lifestyle I said yes. He then handed me what I estimate to be 80mg of a white powder he called 2ct7 along with a brief 'man... it will turn you on'.<br>
<br>
I went home and called over an eager friend (who also had never heard of 2ct7). we sat on my couch and asked our selfs a series of questions to make sure our mind sets were correct before jumped into this unknown land. After about an hour and 1gm of grass had passed we decided to go for it.<br>
<br>
I split us up two lines (one each) as evenly as I could and chopped a straw. we decided to snort at the same time. After the imediate horrific nose and throat pain within 30 seconds both of us were truly 'high'.<br>
<br>
With this drug (at least insuffalated) there is no gradual peak and plateu it is just a slap in the face with visuals and an apperciation for music and atmosphere like no other. as soon as I lifted my head from the mirror the floral pattern on my love seat began to twist and turn and melt off the cool black fabric of the chair. But, I was temporarily brought back for a moment when the burning in my throat over took me and I was forced to jog outside the door and vomit in the yard.<br>
<br>
I walked back into my apartment to find my friend layed out on my couch looking quite content yet a little lost(we didn't actually speak to each other until after we had both surfaced again, with the exception of 'change the music to some dub or some floyd'). I drank some water to wash out the vomit taste and walked into the living room and collapsed on my couch. and pretty much thats were I stayed for the next 6 hours. During that six hours and I was in a constant state of contentment and euphoria, I felt like the metaphysical mother was wrapping me in a cool comfortable blanket my body felt so nice at times almost orgasmic, and actually had a few moments were I had to check myself to make sure I hadn't in fact climaxed.<br>
<br>
The visuals were very similar to a medium dose of LSD. Things breathing, glowing, growing, one painting on my wall in particular kept turnings his head toward me and smiling, somtimes he would move his wing(the painting is of an archangel cradling a naked women)as if to bring me into the picture with him, one of my house plants danced and grew ludcriously large through out the entire trip. it would grow more limbs and branches and sway and dance perfectly in beat with the music, at one point I think I heard it laughing(it was probably my companion lost in his own blissful little world).<br>
<br>
Eventually after about 7 hours we both began to surface and rustle about the apartment still not saying much of anything to each other.  after about 9 hours we were our normal boistrous selves again but both were still seeing colors and tracers (tracers actually didn't show them until the 'come down').<br>
<br>
We both agreed it was a very fun and at times awestrikingly euphoric experince, as far as personal revelations, and introspective discovery goes there wasn't much to speak of, 2ct7 felt like more of a recreation chemical than a spirtiual chemical (typical of most synthetics) also we had stuffy noses and nasal voices for the next day or so. The best aspect of my experince was the complete lack of 'uh oh moments' and paranoia, although I didn't enjoy that fact this drug pinned to my couch, most of the time I had no desire to move but when I did want to I felt like it was physically impossible.<br>
<br>
overall it was fun, aside from the painful experince of snorting (even the drips burned my thoart all the way down my neck) usually I take psychoactives for meditative purposes but this was purley an experiment, and all in all a pleasant one. 2CT7 is someting I've not done since and perhaps I wont ever try it again, which won't be that big of a loss.<br>
<br>
