Note: Time became a figment of my imagination on this night, I will do my best to accurately put times on the events, but can't promise it's fully correct.<br>
<br>
(11:30 P.M.) The night started out quite normal. A friend of mine (who I will call N for safety purposes) and I were being lazy at his house and getting high. Due to probation, I cannot smoke herb and have switched to herbal potpourri blends for a temporary replacement. As we are taking rips outside, we begin to talk about how it's been a while since the two of us had an experience with something. After a few minutes of thought, I decided to call my friend Z and see if we could get some 25i-nbome blotters. He says yes and we begin a half hour drive to retrieve them. By the time we get there, we are about to leave my friend Z's house to acquire the 25i when his drunk friend shows up and refuses to let us ride in my car, he insists on driving. Reluctantly, we hop in the car and take a sketchy ride to a nearby house. We sit in the car as my friend Z calls his dude only to find out he 'doesn't have anymore'. So we drove a half hour and risked our lives with this drunken moron driving for nothing. We head back to Z's house, he apologizes for the inconvenience, and we leave. As we are leaving N and I are very disappointed, and he decides to give a buddy of his a call. We are in luck, he has just six blotters left with our names on them.<br>
<br>
(12:50 A.M.) We reach his house after about fifteen more minutes of driving and retrieve six 25i-nbome blotters. In my excitement I immediately put mine under my tongue and hold it there. N waits until he is about half way through the drive home to put his under his tongue. On the way back, we stop for cigarettes and glow sticks at Walmart, only to find out they stopped selling our favorite glow sticks. Sad but not down and out, we head back to his place from Walmart.<br>
<br>
(1:15 A.M.) Right when we left Walmart I started noticing the drug taking effect. My body temperature fluctuating, things appearing brighter, definitely not sober. We get to his house and get out of the car, to which N says 'Holy shit, I'm already starting to feel this really hard'. I agreed. We go in his room and set up some tunes for the night. His walls are beginning to breathe and wave, his ceiling completely engulfed in kaleidoscopic patterns and swirling around. A few minutes pass by of us just taking in what is happening before we both decided to go outside to smoke. He packs his bong full of some great smelling cannabis, while I sadly pack my herbal potpourri in my own bong. He takes his rip and instantly has a smile on his face. 'My brain is having an orgasm' he told me. I laughed and ripped my bowl. Cleared it, exhaled, and HOLY SHIT. <br>
<br>
The kaleidoscopic patterns I was seeing in the ground and on his walls started moving at hyper-speed. Small spots of blue, purple, red, and orange all appear in my field of vision, just floating in mid-air. 'Dude...this shit improves the fuck out of it, I can't believe what I'm seeing.' A few minutes pass I sit there getting higher and higher every minute that passes, and eventually N asks if I'm okay. I look up at him, and start to panic a little. The way the sky was lit up green outside, the way he was positioned against the lighting coming through the trees behind him, it made my mind bend and warp into thinking he was the commander of some demon army who were going to take over that night. I shake it off and realize I'm just frying my mind out and say 'yeah, yeah dude I'm fine'.<br>
<br>
We decide to go out front and smoke cigarettes while we look at the world around us. The instant he opened that gate the experience felt like it shot off to a whole new level. The cars in his driveway looked very cartoon-like, and the grills of them looked like smiling faces. The road swirled with endless patterns of kaleidoscopes all up and down it. The street lamp was bending, morphing, getting brighter and then dimmer. It was insane. We look up at this giant tree he has in his yard and are completely engulfed in the leaves and branches. They look as if they are almost dancing, then waving to us. At one point, we were watching the leaves and I swear I was seeing the insides of the branches and leaves intertwine out of them over and over again.<br>
<br>
After what was probably a good hour of taking in our surroundings, we decide to go on a walk around his neighborhood. It was getting close to the holidays, so some people had Christmas decorations up. The lights seemed to glow so bright with such clarity. We passed one house that had an inflatable Frosty the Snowman up, and we both instantly just stopped and said 'Whoa, shit.' He had an arm that slightly sway back and forth to make it appear as if he were waving, and it tripped me out for some reason. His face was distorting and his carrot nose was growing when I told N we should go back to his house for some more smoking. We begin to head back and N keeps looking back at the inflatable Frosty. 'Is he tripping you out bro?' I ask my companion, to which he replies 'Yo, I swear his head is following me. It's freaking me the fuck out.' <br>
<br>
(4:00 A.M.) Getting away from the bad vibes we return to his house and begin to smoke more. I wasn't really feeling the potpourri effects anymore, so I decided to smoke another bowl. As soon as I did, blast off. Everything seemed to be distorting, morphing, changing colors, patternizing/kaleidoscoping like crazy. We go back into his room and it has completely transformed. Now instead of just the walls and his ceiling moving and distorting with patterns, his floor, couch, bed, and dresser are joining in on the fun. Sitting there like toddlers with our mouths wide open and eyes perked, I exclaim 'Dude, I've tripped hard before, but this is just bat shit insanity.' N agrees and we both laugh. We continue to fry and occasionally go outside to smoke herb and cigarettes until about 7 A.M.<br>
<br>
At around 7 A.M., I am still feeling the effects of the drug but no where near what I was. Looking out at the little bit of sunlight coming in through the cracks of my friend's blinds, I watch the light intertwine together and make new colors for about an hour until N is finally tired enough to pass out. I head out to my car and start it up realizing just how much I'm still feeling it. (DON'T DRIVE WHILE TRIPPING - NOT SMART.) I decide I'm okay, spark a cigarette and start driving home. After about 5 minutes, I get home safe and sound, smoke another few bowls of potpourri, trip out for about another half hour, and finally manage to fall asleep.<br>
<br>
 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span>   <br>
<br>
It has been about two and a half weeks since this experience, and occasionally I will get a muscle spasm which I've read is actually quite common with 25i-nbome. It's not too bad, occasionally it can become annoying. Would I do 25i-nbome again? Fuck yeah. Just be wary of side effects.<!-- End Body -->
