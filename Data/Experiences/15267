I'd like to put this experience with heavy drinking on the site so that other regulars that visit erowid to research drugs can see how heavy drinking can really effect you.<BR>
<BR>
I am a heavyweight when it comes to drinking and im only 17. I smoke weed, and occasionaly I do lsd, shrooms, and opium. Every once and a while i pop a few painkillers. Anyway, me and my friends were going to a kids trailer for a night of partying. We had a bottle of vodka and jim beam. We were supposed to have weed but the dealer never came through.<BR>
<BR>
So i drank. Between the time of 7pm and 9pm i had about 3 drinks and i was somewhat buzzed. by this time the lightweights were already puking and passing out. I was still going. we stayed up and partied for a while longer. Around 3am everyone was asleep except for me. i noticed the jim beam was still pretty much full so i started doing shots. i lost count by the 8th shot. I dont remember anything, i was so drunk i couldnt tell if i was sleeping or still really drunk.<BR>
<BR>
I dont know if i slept, all i know is that i had been drinking from 3am to about 6 or 7am cuz when one of my friends woke up with a hangover i got up and was drunk out of my mind. I made a couple more drinks and passed out on the kitchen floor. I still dont remember much but i do remember getting into my friends trunk for a ride home (im claustrophobic) but it was the only way home. I was in the trunk for about 45 minutes. cuz my friends are assholes. <BR>
<BR>
When i got home i thought i was dying, i couldnt breathe. i puked in the toilet for a while and took a shower and slept. my hangover didnt start till 5pm that night. i felt horrible, that whole next day was completely irrelevent. Nothing mattered except get better and sober up. Turns out i had finished off almost the whole bottle of jim beam. <BR>
<BR>
If this gets on the site, please read this and reconsider heavy drinking, if ur gonna drink the hard stuff, moderate. 5 drinks is enuf to get u drunk. <BR>
<BR>
This was the worst experience of my life, dont let it happen to you. take care and be responsible.<!-- End Body -->
