 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span>  <br>
<br>
I thought I had come off my trip enough to drive, but as I hit the road I realized my trip was still in full swing as everything took on almost comic book like visuals and the sound from the window made it seem like the car might take flight. It was about 1pm and I had to pull over twice to recuperate, and at one point even called a friend who lived right up the street from where I made a stop. She said she was writing a paper due tomorrow and could not drive me home, even though I told her repeatedly I was tripping face and could not drive (btw I am no longer friends with this girl because a true friend would have realized how dangerous the situation was). Even though it took me what seemed an eternity to get home, along with missing a few streets and driving well below speed limit, I finally made it. <br>
<br>
Anxiety started to return as I was alone and still filled with all this energy. I decided to take music onto my patio and do some fluid yoga and stretching. As the music played I felt compelled to dance. It was if something took over my body as I swirled and danced so expressively with the effortless grace of a ballerina. I danced on the patio for hours until around 5 pm when friends started to come over to keep me company while my trip subsided. One of them suggested I play the piano while in this state, and as I played the same keys I played for years, I found that my hands just flowed over the keys and the music had much more dynamics and soul than ever before. This filled me with immense joy. <br>
<br>
I started to realized the beauty of the trip in those hours back home, and was saddened that I couldn’t be with R and that I couldn’t go back and make the trip as beautiful as it should have been for my friends, since previously in my circle I was known as “trip queen,” and somewhat of a psychonaut, not the type to experience a “bad trip.” It was probably this ego, and a number of other factors that influenced this. But on the comedown and reflection of this trip I realize how much value I gained from this, and how much I learned about myself, my goals, religion, my sexuality, and more than all ENERGIES.  <br>
<br>
I now have a goal for my future as well as a plan to better my self in every aspect. I was overwhelmed by the immense energy I was feeling during the trip, which caused me to resist the drug instead of flowing with it. I did not want to drop my ego completely and let go. Spiritually, I realized that constant meditation is useful in quieting all this mind chatter, and after the unexplainable experiences I had on this trip I am extremely interested in harvesting these energies for healing.  What I have gained from this “bad trip” far outweighs all of the hell I went through and I looking at it comprehensively I can learn and appreciate this.<!-- End Body -->
