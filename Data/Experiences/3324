<!-- Start Body -->

I took about 10mg of 'foxy' at about 8:40pm, thinking it might be lessened by tolerance since I took 6mg just 2 days ago.  At 8:52 i could already start to feel a body buzz.  By 9:00 I was going pretty good, about as good as the 6mg 2 days ago.<BR>
<BR>
Around 9:15-9:25 (I'm not sure exactly) we got out a joint, and I took a few hits off that.  Whoa!!!!  It kicked in FAST, I was seeing patterns and colors everywhere, and the person I was with was talking about something, but I was almost 'gone'.  I went to sit on the porch outside, and everything I looked at was a mess!  Trails were so strong that they would just mush into tons of little circles and wierd shapes and stay there.  No words can describe it.<BR>
<BR>
I went back inside, still not at the peak, but while I was sitting inside, I felt like I was slipping 'out of it', where I didnt know what was real and what was not.  I was seeing sound, hearing light, smelling light, feeling sound!  Everything was a jumbled mess, yet fun!<BR>
<BR>
I could somehow still hold a conversation with the other person, who didnt know how much I was tripping.   I was thinking i better tell this person that if I just stop talking and go nuts to just leave me alone, cause I felt like I was going to just lay on the bed and leave the world!  I was right on that 'edge', of going away, then coming back, all my senses would tear apart, vision was all messed up, then come back barely so I knew where I was again.<BR>
<BR>
I was extremely sensitive to every little thing that people that came in the room would do.  If they looked at me wierd I would get a big fear sensation, but then it would go away. After about an hour or two (I am not exactly sure), I came down a tiny bit, to where I had a better grip on reality, so I had the guts to go outside, and go for a walk.  Everywhere I looked there was very strong patterns on everything.  The sidewalk had these designs carved into it, making wierd shapes.  It reminded me of the last shroom experience I had, only way stronger.<BR>
<BR>
I had less of a 'body high' now, my mind was mostly clear, I still had the little bits of 'lost reality' stuff going on for split seconds then I would come back.  I came back, and sat around the house playing with a laser pointer, talking to people, etc.  I was still tripping HARD til about 3AM!  Hard as i mean MASSIVE visuals, everyone's face was made up of some kind of textured shapes, all connected together.  Everything I looked at, random dots on a wall, all were connected together in some way.  I finally tried to sleep at about 3:30, I was yawning, even though I still had these massive patterns on everything.  I couldn't get to sleep for at least an hour, but I finally did.<BR>
<BR>
5-MEO-DIPT can be a full blown psychedelic!  I never expected this with the dosage I took.  I wouldn't want to take any higher dose than this!  I'm not sure what it would be like to be 'stuck' over that edge into total loss of reality, it was scary, yet fun, being right on that edge and coming back.  This blew any past LSD/shroom trip i've ever had away.<!-- End Body -->
