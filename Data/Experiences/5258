I've never experienced anything like this.<BR>
<BR>
I managed to sleep. 11hours later I feel fine.<BR>
<BR>
This is my second 2ct7 experience, I first took a small dose 20mg--saw nice mild acid mushroom like neon light hallucinations--- to make sure I have no medical complications...4 days later I try this....<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
I was completely crazy.  I took about 40mg of 2ct7.  I watched tv for less than 2 hours.<BR>
<BR>
Went to my room, turned out the lights, looked up at a piece of wire that is stuck in my ceiling with a ball of cobwebs on it, and saw a insect pushing itself out of a coocoon.<BR>
<BR>
Got compleltely scared, seeing that the insect is 5inches tall.  Left, went back to the tv for 10minutes<BR>
<BR>
Went back to my room, turned out the lights, looked at the discoloring in my carpet and started to see black grey snakes along the floor.<BR>
<BR>
Left, went to get some water.  Came back to my room, left the lights on.  Looked at the floor<BR>
<BR>
The floor would move as if something was under it, shadows along the floor would converge into a 2x2foot circle.  If I touched the concave area were something was trying to break out, it was hot.  Every hallucination had a heat, and a mass, and felt too real to ignore.<BR>
<BR>
Then used my computer to try and find loon. Didnt<BR>
<BR>
When I looked back at the floor, the floor was covered in maggots, and if I looked longer, the maggots turned into worms, worms into snakes.<BR>
<BR>
I was afraid to look at the floor, I never stared at it.  As I started to I would create terrible things that I would have to walk on.<BR>
<BR>
I decided to go to the bathroom, walking on maggots, worms, snakes.  It felt squishy and uncomfortable  I went into the bathroom.  I started to fill up the bathtub.  I took a piss.<BR>
<BR>
The toilet water level decreased untill the top plane of water were it met with porcelin resembled a human head.<BR>
<BR>
The water started to bubble in the northern hemisphere of the bowl.  My brain was outlined perfectly with bubbles, completely scared me  Then my brain of bubbles swirled around.  I tried everything I could to make myself see what was really there,<BR>
<BR>
I could do nothing to bring myself out of it.  Then I touched the water in the tub.  The water was blue.  The water dyed my hand blue.  The side of the toiled started to flow red water out of it<BR>
<BR>
When I flushed the toilet it would not refill.  I tried to turn off the bathtub but it kept dripping.  then decided I was not ready to live with snakes and gaged myself for a few minutes<BR>
<BR>
I finally got the water to stop and I left the bathroom.  My zerbra like rug began to lift up, I heard growling sounds, and a tongue on my arm  I left walking on squishy stuff to the couch. The couch was a mean cat.  I sat on it, heard it growl, feel its tongue<BR>
<BR>
I looked back and the cushins were opening up and producing some heat...so I left to the kitchen  I would changed the form of the couch, rounding the edges, creating paw like ripples into the cusins, and raising the center...then add some eyes, and a tongue that hisses at you when you get near it.<BR>
<BR>
In the kitchen I looked at the tile thinking I would be safe from the awfull stuff on the carpet, but the shapes on the tile began to move, looking like rats, felling them move under my feet.  bad.  so i sat on a rug in my kitchen.  looked at the blue rug, more maggots, this time more terrifying.  the maggots turned upwards and something began protruding from them, stingers, like wasps.<BR>
<BR>
left the rug alone, hoping the wasps would not hatch.  then I gave my green chair another mean personality, and I left the living room<BR>
<BR>
...too much crazy shit happened.  the bugs are bad.  I felt bugs underneath my skin, bugs and worms underneet my skin.  every few minutes I would hear this hipitched cry of millions of bugs.  then the would start comming in the walls.  then in my body, hands stomache, I could feel them moving<BR>
<BR>
even saw then moving on my nose.  saw them in my hands.  felt them in my lips, in my eyelids, moving in and out everone of my teeth<BR>
<BR>
...snakes on the walls, snakes on table tops..ect ect<BR>
<BR>
I never let myself stay in a dark room, I was fuxored up.<BR>
<BR>
I fell asleep 8 hours after I ingested it<!-- End Body -->
