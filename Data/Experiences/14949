My husband and I recently met someone who was selling 2C-B.  We read alot about it and decided it might be fun to do on an upcoming trip to Reno.  Before going to Reno I tested some of the yellowish powder (out of a gelcap) with Marquis reagent.  The substance appeared to turn black immediately and since I didnt notice any bubbling or fizzing (indication of DXM) I assumed it must be ecstasy.  While we were a little dissapointed (we were really looking forward to the sensual trip 2C-B is supposed to bring on) my husband had never tried ecstasy before and it sounded like fun so we decided to take it anyway.  <BR>
<BR>
That night I made sure we had lots of lotion and glow things to play with, then we dropped around 7PM.  We decided it might be cool to go sit in the spa for a little bit while we were waiting for it to hit us.  Once we got down to the spa, the smell of the chlorine seemed overwhelming and extremely nausiating.  After about 10 minutes in the spa the smell was making me so sick I had to get out.  I decided to take a quick jaunt to the steam room but only after a couple minutes I had this terrible feeling that I needed to get back to the room immediately.  We both headed back to our room hoping that it was just the chlorine that was making our stomachs so upset.  After we got back my husband started noticing trails and mild visuals.  I told him that there was a chance that what we got was DXM and not MDMA and that if he wanted to bail now he would have to gag himself..  while the thought is pretty disgusting it beats ingesting something as dangerous as DXM.  He said he would wait a little longer to be sure about the visuals.  I was feeling extremely nausiated and sat in the shower thinking it was just that damn chlorine smell.  <BR>
<BR>
At this point I was noticing the shower seemed to get lighter, then darker if my field of vision changed.  I got out of the shower and my husband was beginning to panick.  He knew the onset might be intense but nothing like this.  I sat there and held him and promised him it was going to be okay.  I hadnt got any visuals that seemed signifigant at this point and thought maybe there was still a chance we did take MDMA.  I was sitting next to him on the couch staring at the carpet when... KAZAMM!!  The shit hit me like a ton of bricks.  The carpet was doing some serious multidimesional/melting stuff similar to a high dose of LSD only my body felt HORRIBLE.  I didnt want to move at all. To even stand up made me horribly dizzy and nausiated.  My husband slowly moved his arm in front of him and his arm melted into a 'wing' made of skin flapping in the wind. He had the urge to tear all of the wallpaper off the walls and felt like he was going crazy.  The visuals were totally different - like nothing I've ever seen on LSD.  <BR>
<BR>
I knew we had taken DXM or DXM combined with god knows what else.  I did everything I could to stay out of this peak mentally.  I avoided going into any of the visuals I was getting and tried to stay as mentally sober as I possibly could.  My main concern was keeping us safe and determining weather or not we needed to go to the hospital, how long this would last, and exactly what the hell we took.  Then I threw up harder than I have ever thrown up in my entire life.  The wierd thing was that the whole time my body felt horrible and I was having some insane visuals I mentally felt in control - even sober (Despite the fact that when I closed my eyes I would see straight into another dimension as if a movie was playing before my closed eyes and I was watching - some of it was extremely dark (aliens beings ect.), some of it was extremely beautiful but it was more intense, overpowering and realistic than any of the hallucinations I have ever experienced off other recreational drugs - like the door to my imagination was completely unlocked).  <BR>
<BR>
I called the guy who sold us the '2C-B' and asked him exactly what the hell we just took.  He absolutely denied the possibility of it being DXM and said it was MDA (not MDMA) but there was nothing speedy or euphoric or even pleasant about this.  He also told me it would last at least 10 hours.  I felt in control enough at this point that I decided just to wait and keep an eye on the situation before making any other phone calls.  Within four hours I drank 4 1.5 liter bottles of water and still felt thirsty.  I had severe cotton mouth and despite the fact that I drank over a gallon of water I couldnt pee at all and my stomach felt so full.  It seemed like 5 hours literally flew by and the whole time we were just trying to stay still and not feel sick. We finally decided to get up and walk around the casino but just the jaunt downstairs left me extremely dizzy and I just wanted to get back to the room so I could lay down.  We played with our glowsticks some and held them over our closed eyes which intensified some of the visuals and while it was intense it was nothing I would ever care to experience again.. EVER.  <BR>
<BR>
At about the 5 to 6 hour point I began getting severe chills along with this wierd tingly sensation all over my whole body.  I remember thinking I felt like a mint.  Eventually my chills would quickly sway into feeling too hot then a few minutes later I would feel freezing again.  We finally passed out around 1AM and slept on and off until 10:30 AM the next moring.  We checked out of the Hotel (still feeling awful physically) and came home.  It is 11:00 PM the next day and I still dont feel right mentally or physically (more physically).  I have been doing a lot of research and nowhere have I found a drugtest that will test specifically for DXM which makes it nearly impossible to test for in the future.  I wanted to submit a remaining gelcap to DanceSafe but unfortunately they will only accept pressed pills so I cant confirm that what we took was DXM or not.  I seriously hope that a new test will come out soon that will help people avoid this awful drug.<!-- End Body -->
