I had just finished a hard day's work when I decided to go home and drink some of the ayahuasca that I had cooked-up about a week earlier.  Disappointed with the weak intensity of my last experience with the brew, I decided to double my dose.  I gulped down about two ounces of the foul-tasting elixir and sat back and waited.   <br/>
<br/>
About a half hour later, mild visuals began to take effect and I became nauseous as hell.  I went into my backyard and puked, after which the visuals became especially intense.  Everything looked as though it was alive in some way, even the cement of my patio.  I then went into my bedroom and relaxed on my easy chair, still feeling extremely nauseous.  <br/>
<br/>
About five minutes later I began to sense as though I was experiencing a different dimension of reality.  Although the ayahuasca-induced perception was very insightful and enlightening, the nausea was way too intense.  I soon started gagging and puking about every five minutes, which in combination with my altered state of mind, led me to believe that I had overdosed and might die.  At first I told myself that the experience was only a temporary drug induced state that would eventually pass over; however, the nausea got so intense that I began to seriously worry about my health.  I became so worried, in fact, that I called 911 emergency for help.  The paramedics came and took me to the hospital where I spent about three hours coming-down from the scariest hallucinogenic experience of my life.  I don’t regret the trip, though, because the seemingly near-death experience was very enlightening  It’s weird how the normal everyday worries of life become so trivial when you think you’re going to die.  <br/>
<br/>
When I was released from the hospital I felt silly about thinking that I was dying and calling 911.  But during the trip I was certain that I was going to kick the bucket.<!-- End Body -->
