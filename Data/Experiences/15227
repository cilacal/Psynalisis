It was my birthday.  I was excited to be going out to one of my favorite dance clubs.  I was very much in a great frame of mind; very happy and content.<BR>
<BR>
I consider myself an experienced (about 7 years) user of MDMA.  I have used GHB, Crystal Meth, and Ketamine for about 1 year.  It was my third experience with 2C-T-7.  The previous 2 experiences were very good, but they involved using 2CT7 without any other substances.<BR>
 <BR>
The night was going very well using MDMA and GHB.  I was dancing alot and enjoying myself immensely.  After the club closed, my friends and I went to an after party.  There, I decided to do 2CT7.  I had tried 2CT7 twice before by itself and had glowing experiences.  I was curious to see how 2CT7 would be in combination with other drugs.  <BR>
<BR>
About 1 hour after I took the 2CT7 orally, I began to 'ramp up' and feel excited.  At this point I began to see some visual effects and definite color enhancement.  I had taken a dose of GHB approximately 30 minutes prior to taking the 2CT7.  After about 2 hours of taking the 2CT7, I began to get slightly disoriented and extremely nauseated.  I should note that I almost never vomit when taking drugs: until that moment.  I proceeded to vomit and dry-heave for approximately 1 hour after that point.<BR>
<BR>
I think my friends were getting bit concerned with me at that point and took me home.  We then sat around my place for a few hours.  I was well into the trip at that point.  I was seeing visual effects such as tracers, closed-eye visuals, and color enhancement.  I was still unable to keep anything in my stomach during this period.<BR>
<BR>
I was feeling very agitated during this period also.  I was getting a bit frightened because my pulse was getting a bit rapid and I was getting very dehydrated.  I was also seeing images and hearing sounds that were not actually present.  I was getting very tired at this point as it had been a long night of partying.  I basically wanted the trip be over at this point, but I knew I was only about half-way though at this point.  I just kept telling myself that I had taken a lot of drugs and eventually it would end.<BR>
<BR>
My friends were snorting ketamine during this time, so I thought some K might help to relax me.  I snorted about 5 bumps of K in about 30 minutes.  The K changed the trip.  It was hard to explain, but I was now hallucinating in pools.  This was cool, but failed to relax me.<BR>
<BR>
I decided at that point just to ride out the trip without any other drugs.  Gradually, I was able to drink some water and my pulse became normal.  About 8 hours after I took the 2CT7, I started to come down.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the experience wasn't all that bad; except for the nausea.  I think the GHB in combination with the 2CT7 caused the vomiting.  I definitely won't do those 2 in combination again.  The ketamine mixed with 2CT7 was pretty cool, though.<BR>
<BR>
I wouldn't recommend doing all of these drugs in combination.  I think 2CT7 is a drug best enjoyed by itself (or maybe with some K) during a time when you can devote 12 hours to the experience.<!-- End Body -->
