I was going to a Rave, I hadn't consumed anything except liquids all day.  I took AMT an old friend had given me, a couple hours before another friend was to pick me up.  He claimed it was like DMT, with an Amphetamine ring around the molecule.<BR>
<BR>
7:30 p.m. I dipped my pinky into the little aluminum fold I had, and put it in my mouth, it tasted really funny (but oddly familiar), I wanted to start conservative with a strange drug.  About an hour later, I started feeling it come up.  It made my eyes flutter like MDMA is supposed to. Then about 15 minutes later I started feeling sick.  Real sick.  Different than throwing up on E, more like being sickly drunk.  I couldn't stop dry heaving.  Finally that subsided, so I sat and drank water.  And noticed the watery psychedelic effects of my red curtains.<BR>
<BR>
One thing that distinguises AMT from LSD is the ease of communication.  So that when my friend picked me up to go, he didn't even know that I was seriously and increasingly getting intoxicated.  We where driving in his huge station wagon, that floated like a boat.  He had just gotten off work and wanted to get a Sub Sandwich.  So we drove uptown, and I was trying hard to not throw up, but I did anyway into my backpack.  Finally, I decided there is no way in hell that I can go to the party, I told him to drive me home.<BR>
<BR>
10:30p.m - When I got home I just sat and listened to music.  Which sounded very tight.  The effect kept getting stronger.  I started hearing this humming sound.  There seemed to be a light shining above me.  And I kept turning to look at it.  I did get a jaw clenching effect.  At the peak of it I was hearing this popping sound and crackling.  Immediatly I knew it was the sound I had read about from Terrence McKenna describing DMT.  It felt as if my conciousness was splitting.  And it was if the popping was more REAL than anything I was seeing or feeling, as if it all where shattering from the sound. This lasted for about 5 minutes.  It was a bit overwhelming.  I was'nt grounded enough for that strong of an experience.  The comedown lasted for another five hours, I just laid in bed.  <BR>
It made me scared honestly, that this strong of a drug isn't illegal, made me wonder if it's an MK-Ultra type drug.  It probably would have helped having someone there to comfort me.  <BR>
<BR>
I havn't done it in three months.  And don't plan on it anytime soon.  But I wouldn't rule it out forever.  It should be done with proper set and setting which I might not have had at the time.  But parts of it were incredibly interesting.  It probably would be real nice to have a tiny bit WITH Ecstacy, to kick it in the butt.  It had a similar trance as Crystal, Acid, and MDMA all ROLLED into one!!<!-- End Body -->
