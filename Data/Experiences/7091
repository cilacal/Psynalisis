    The Saturday started out like any other, a few joints and the occassional beer.  My friend returned the vial of 2C-T-7 I had left in his car, at 6 pm.  After drinking the rest (10mg) I cleaned my room and waited. I began to feel the fluttery floating feeling inside, immediately.  There was a large party happening downstairs, and I was interested to see how I would react to the overstimulation.  As the rainbow fanning patterns grew, the lights began their strobing, everything manifesting triumphantly,  my friend leans over and says, ' Do you wanna split a cap of E?'.... 'Of course,' I agreed, and did what I was given @ 9 pm, a nice phat cap of happy face.  It was orange, my favorite colour.<BR>
<BR>
    As a loyal user of psychedelics, I find MDMA too easy; you have to earn your life enhancing trip with LSD, or 2C-T-7.  I had just swallowed the pill, and another friend of mine placed a few chocolates with 1.7 grams of mushrooms (each) within. I ate 2 @9:15pm.  I knew I was alll alone on this trip.  <BR>
<BR>
    2C-T-7 makes me go inside myself, which makes talking casually  impossible, everything seems to have  divine symbolism packed into it. As my facination with every thing in the world became almost too much to bear, I decided to go smoke a cigarette. 11:30pm.<BR>
<BR>
The psychedelic fear was begining to creep up on me (perhaps it was the mushrooms) the fear of nothing, and everything, all at once. I very rarely experience this. The fractal structure of the universe was unravelling, and the molecular rainbow prisms were flying everywhere.<BR>
<BR>
And then I heard a voice come from not a place in this world: <BR>
<BR>
'the Universe loves you alice.'<BR>
<BR>
As I heard the voice a cloud of mist dissolved into my vision.  It was both close up and far away, large and small, undulating and recycling within itself.  Everyplace I looked, it was there, up and to the left.  Like a new addition to my field of vision. A great rush of relief, warmth, and a glowing amber aura spread over every part of my body, it was time to go dancing ...........alone. 12am.<BR>
<BR>
    At the club I do not remember talking. I danced with the misty vision, I call god. Until this point, I danced like a flailing lunatic, emotional and spontaeneous.  This night I actually felt the love of rythyms vibrating into my flesh.  Like a lightening rod, co-ordinated and fixated with honouring the sounds, my body naturally found the fluidity, and a great fussion occured. I felt present in Now. Magnetized to the music. <BR>
<BR>
   That night morning, to sleep, I masturbated in a way that taught me so much about my inner pleasure systems, it's was as if I was my own new lover.  A VIOLENT orgasm sent me to dream land, where I went of on the pirate ship, up in the crows nest. <BR>
<BR>
  I believe this could be a combination for divine revelation<BR>
<BR>
Definately preload with 5-HTP, my brain felt vacant the next day, even though I see every prismatic movement of the water vapour in clouds.......... still.<!-- End Body -->
