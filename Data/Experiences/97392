MINDSET: Ready, willing, happy, but with a little touch of anxiety<br>
<br>
SETTING: Camping with friends on a beach on a warm summer evening<br>
<br>
DOSE: 20mg weighed on 0.001g scales<br>
<br>
PAST EXPERIENCE: 2CB, 2CI, 4-HO-MIPT, 4-HO-MET, MDMA, MDA, Shrooms, LSD<br>
<br>
Let me start by saying that tripping for me is often a social experience, rather than a spiritual journey. I feel already feel happy, sane, and like I really understand myself, so I use psychedelics mainly for fun. <br>
<br>
However, sometimes they take me by surprise, and give me a deeper insight into life when I'm not expecting it. This night would be one such experience. We set up camp in a secluded beach on a warm summer evening. Waves gently lapped, the air was warm yet fresh, the sky was clear, and a meteor shower meant we knew we were in for some shooting stars. It felt like a perfect evening.<br>
<br>
20:00 - I swallowed the 4-HO-MET. <br>
<br>
20:15 - We moved our air beds underneath an overhang on the cliffside, a little way back from the water (we didn't know how high the tide would get, so played safe). We had a great view of the bay and night sky.<br>
<br>
21:00 - First effects. I felt a gentle wave of euphoria rush over me and feel the familiar energy that says 'you're about to have an interesting time'. <br>
<br>
21:30 - It's very dark, so We light a small fire. The orange glow gently lights our surroundings. I look up at the cliff ledge above our heads. The rocks appear to twist and contort into bodies and faces, almost aztec in nature, the entire thing looks sculpted and is ever changing. I am astonished by the intricacy. I lay open mouthed and laugh at the beauty of it.<br>
<br>
22:00 - I start to see gentle, detailed, small wireframe fractals, of many colours, they cling to the edges of objects, dancing around them playfully. They are incredibly pretty, and although subtle are easy to see and a joy to watch. The sound of the waves becomes somehow more digital and sparkling, rushing through me in a most pleasurable way.<br>
<br>
22:15 - I can converse easily, although it's harder to vocalise my thoughts than usual. It's very easy to laugh, and see the funny side of things. <br>
<br>
22:30 - A hint of paranoia. A small rock falls from the cliff. I think about the weight above us and consider moving out into the beach away from the cliff edge. This preoccupies me for perhaps 5-10 minutes, before I decide that the chances of a landslide are very small. I'll take my chances. It's very easy to push negative/paranoid thoughts out of my head, even though I'm a solid +++ by now. <br>
<br>
23:00- I decide I need a piss. I get up and move away from our campfire. As I move further into the darkness I am careful where I tread, and urinate around the corner out of sight of the fire. It's almost pitch black. At this point, I look up. And when I do, I am astonished - my jaw drops and I say out loud: 'oh my GOD' - the night sky looks incredible. I am blown away.<br>
<br>
I live in the city, so seeing a clear night sky in a dark location is always a treat. But this was something else. I was speechless. It was almost painfully beautiful. I stared up at the stars for a long time, as they shimmered and glowed. The stars were joined up by these kind of 'energy lines', it seemed like a huge cosmic grid. Astonishing and awe inspiring. I was knocked back by the beauty of the universe. Waves of euphoria rushed through me. I felt utterly connected with the cosmos, in my own small way. It was one of the most profound experiences of my life.<br>
<br>
00:00 - I rejoin my friends. I can feel it's wearing off now, but I still enjoy the aztec patterns in the rocks. Conversation is easy and fun.<br>
<br>
01:00 - Almost back to baseline. I have a few beers.<br>
<br>
02:00 - Sleep<br>
<br>
09:00 - Wake up in the morning feeling great.<br>
<br>
Summary: 4-HO-MET is sometimes knocked for being an 'easy' or 'light' psychedelic. <br>
<br>
This is unfair. It's true that it's easy on the body and mind, but it can produce the most stunningly beautiful visuals, incredible euphoria, immense laughter, but also offer real insight and incredible appreciation of the world. <br>
<br>
It's also reasonably easy to socialise with on low to moderate doses, and the short duration of action is a bonus if you don't want to be up all night. I have used 4-HO-MET upward of 20 times, and every time has been wonderful.<!-- End Body -->
