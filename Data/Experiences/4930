I know a person who nearly killed himself last year after using 2c-t-7. This is a write up of that. Since this person doesn't use the net that much, speak English much, and care much, I decided to write this. I will call him A.<BR>
<BR>
A is a young man, light weight. He was ditching his highschool, at B's place. I was at work. After work I came over and A was on the living room floor having a good time and talking crazy shit about his cool hallucinations. I heard from B, that they had both  snorted 30 mg of 2c-t-7.<BR>
<BR>
I sat down, smoked some weed and tried to watch tv as A and B tripped their asses off. Then I too took 30 mg, orally however.<BR>
<BR>
An hour passed. A began to spin and spin around untill he vommited all around B's place. I was the only one sane enough to clean it up, so I did. I felt somewhat embarrassed as B's sister was there too, and obviously didn't like what was happening. A was also constantly saying the same rude things to people and B thought he was just being an asshole on purpose and they almost began to fight.<BR>
<BR>
The next couple hours, A got caught in this wierd circle. He would sit down on the sofa, ask if he can wash his face. People would answer various things. No matter what answer he got he would get up and go splash some water on his face, then sit down and ask for a cigarette. This same thing would happen over and over again, untill nobody wanted to answer his questions anymore. This was about 5 hours from snorting the substance.<BR>
<BR>
When it finally stoped and he came down, he told us about places <BR>
underground where he lived and was a horrible centipede. HE was complainig about animals living in walls and the floor, that they will eat him. He had snorted the substance because this way it would be shorter acting. BUT even as 16 hours had gone, he was still tripping. He tripped all night, and I went to sleep, got up and went to work. After work I went to my own place. As I was there thinking that what ever the fuck happened, A probaly shoudn't do psychedelics ever, I got a call from B telling me that A (still at A's place) had cut his wrists open from three different places on both arms. Very very deep. He was taken to hospital. And after ER treatment was over to an mental asylum. There they kept him for 4 days.<BR>
<BR>
Now A is ok physically. But still occasionally remembers the nightmare.<BR>
<BR>
Note that insufflated 2c-t-7 dosage is around 5 mg. Also note that one should always start with low and sane dosage, when using a new psychedelic. And accurately measure the dosage. Small kids shouldn't mess around with serious entheogens, espescially if they're not wise enough to realize what can follow, or know their own limmits.<BR>
<BR>
Also dosage can differ from person to person. I got no effects at all from the 30 mg orally. B did the same amount insufflated as did A, but only tripped lightly.<BR>
<BR>
The police oddly enough were not involved in the matter at all. Doctors are not allowed to discuss patient matters.<!-- End Body -->
