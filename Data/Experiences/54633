I was presented with the opportunity to try 4-Fluoro-Amphetamine (aka RDJ, 4-FA) for a second time recently.  I was at a weekend outdoor party with a group of friends and wanted something not too confusing.  The first time I'd tried it, I got euphoria and stimulation, with the stimulation lasting many hours after the euphoria had tapered off.  <BR>
<BR>
I took 180mg of 4-FA (weighed by someone else) around 10:30pm (??) and within about 30 minutes, I began to feel stimulation.  Around an hour after ingestion, I began feeling like I was on MDMA.  At first, it seemed like a light empathogenic effect, but then it became obvious that the effects were going well past what I'd expected for the empathic effects and felt very, very much like MDMA.  I started to wonder if the material was actually 4-Fluoro-Amphetamine, but the source was very reliable.  <BR>
<BR>
I had tingling in my extremities and found myself touching my friends on the hands and shoulders and arms with regularity that is quite uncommon in my daily life.  I chatted and felt like helping people, which I'd been doing all day working during the event.  I felt some jaw tension and noticed that others in the group had pretty strong jaw tension as well, although not everyone.  I /thought/ that the jaw tension was less than what MDMA would cause to get an equivalently pleasant effects level, but in retrospect that is not clear.  Two different members of the group that took the material commented that it seemed less physically tight (jaw tension, etc) than MDMA, but the next day I had very sore and tight face and jaw muscles and the back of my inside cheeks had been chewed pretty badly.  The soreness in the facial muscles and jaw lasted for more than 36 hours after taking the material.<BR>
<BR>
I did not take notes on the timing, but around 3 hours after I took the material, I felt a slight drop in the euphoric/empathic effects.  That too seemed consistent with MDMA, but also was consistent with my first experience with 4-FA.  It had the same slight sense of loss associated with the first signs of coming down on MDMA.<BR>
<BR>
Visuals were minimal, probably a loss in ability to focus similar to MDMA, I did not know if there was nystagmus because we were largely in a dark, outdoor camping context.  The moon was half full and there was some minimal lighting.<BR>
<BR>
Around T+4 hours, the group decided to take some 2C-B.  I took 11mg that I had weighed and it was verified known to be 2C-B.  The effects of the 2C-B came on within 30 minutes, visuals started and included starring patterns, wide ones like straight ribbons or streaks in a burst around each light that extended perhaps 5-6 times the width of the light and then circular rainbow halos further out than the ribbons.  The rainbows were mostly red and fading to blue, light, and thin and mostly translucent.<BR>
<BR>
The combination was overly stimulating for me, my heart rate felt too high and I wished I'd taken none or much less of the 2C-B.  This wish, having taken less or no 2C-B increased over time and, as the sun came up and I was still wired, I really wished I'd just stuck with the 4-FA and left it at that.  The other thing I could have done would have been a .25-.5 gram of psilocybin mushrooms if I wanted a little visual interest to go with the experience.  2C-B is physically stimulating and the 4-FA seemed to combine with that.  Body temperature up, heart rate up, blood pressure up.<BR>
<BR>
One friend took 27mg of 2C-B on top of the 4-FA and was put into a state of very strong confusion and visual stimulation that left her unable to really understand where she was or find her friends.<BR>
<BR>
As the sun came up, I saw my reflection in some glass and realized that I looked pretty crazed.  With the facial muscle tension and jaw tension, my face tightens up in a strange way.  Add to that the slight bulging of veins from the blood pressure increase and the pupil dilation and I'm sure the picture was quite something.<BR>
<BR>
There was no way I could sleep without a heavy dose of benzodiazepines and I had a lot of cleaning and packing to do.  I spent the morning hours cleaning and packing up and having a long pleasant chat with a friend who was in a similarly insomniacal space about highschool and college.  Adding the 2C-B onto the 4-FA seemed like it actually took some of the luster out of the 4-FA by complicating the memory of the experience.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the general impression I was left with was that 4-FA has strongly euphoric and empathetic effects similar to MDMA, it is quite physically stimulating, causes jaw and facial muscle tension like MDMA.  If I had it to do over again, I would stick with just 4-FA, add in some alcohol on coming down, and get some sleep.<!-- End Body -->
