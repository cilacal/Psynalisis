<!-- Start Body -->
Home from college on spring break, I had aquired one 10mg pill of methadone, many percocets, a 15mg temazepam capsule, and of course some pot to smoke.  For most of the break I had been working intensly on a research project on Ken Kesey.  For most of the week I had been taking some percs and adderall and doing quite well with my work, but being the last day where I would be sitting at home working I decided to dig into my stash and go a little crazy, hopefully with good results.  Note that at this point I had a bit of a tolerance to the percocet since I had been taking it steadily for the past five days because of wisdom teeth.  And of course I had been taking a little more than the prescibed dose during that time.<br/>
<br/>
I woke up in the morning, and after showering and eating cereal for breakfast, I ate the 20mg adderoll xr that I knew would be keeping me focused throughout my mental journey.  <br/>
<br/>
T = 0 I Ingest the speed and read the newspaper.<br/>
<br/>
T = 0:10 Ingest the 10mg methadone pill, speed not kicking in yet.<br/>
<br/>
T = 1:00 Adderol definetly kicking in, common feeling of euphoria from the first rush of speed.  I eat a snack just to make sure I have enough food in my stomach.  The methadone too has started to make itself known.  Very smooth and relaxed, but FOCUSED and ready to beginning some work.  <br/>
<br/>
T = 1:10 Wip out the books and start doing some reading, feeling excellent.<br/>
<br/>
T = 2:00 Take a break from work to break up some pills.  I have a 15mg capsule of temezepam that I open up, but I decide to save it for later.  I chop up a percocet 5mg oxycodone and snort a few lines.  About five minutes later the percocet kicks in.  Very powerful rush of relaxation.  More euphoria than before, all of my thoughts are about Kesey, the hippies, and parralell philosophies.  I am consumed by my thoughts.<br/>
<br/>
T = 3:00 Decide to take a full 5mg oxycodone percocet.  Continue reading.<br/>
<br/>
T = 3:20 It's about 1:30pm and I am feeling very doped up.  I decide to take a break from work and smoke a bowl of pot from my bong.  Some potent KB of course.  This gets my appetite going so I go into my kitchen and make some sandwiches.  Feeling very fucked up at this point, but the adderoll is still keeping me focused.  <br/>
<br/>
T = 3:40 I go upstairs and do a couple lines of the temezapam and then decide to go for a walk outside.  My vision is clear, and so are my thoughts, which is very surprising.  I am thinking intensly still, with thoughts racing through my head at incredible speeds.  At times I feel almost trapped by my thoughts.  I almost don't notice the sites outside.  It is rather gray out and cold, but I can't feel any of the cold.  Inside my body feels warm and comfortable.  <br/>
<br/>
T = 4:20 return inside to get back to reading.<br/>
<br/>
T = 5:15 becoming slightly dizzy from reading, a little squirmy in the stomach.  Thoughts are becoming a little less clear and concise.  I take a break and as soon as I put the book and my notebook down I immeadiatly feel better.  Dizzyness fading away.  I say fuck it and go upstairs I insullfate the last of the temazepam and percocet.  I wanted to get rid of the stuff before anyone got home anyways.  <br/>
<br/>
T = 5:30 Feeling much better.  Decide to move from reading to a little writing.  I need to make a proposal for a thesis on my paper.  I begin formulating ideas and they are flowing from me beautifully.  Pen in hand I feel euphoric again and very inspired.  I am still a long ways from completing or even writing my paper but I am already trying to form the outline in my head.  <br/>
<br/>
For the next few hours this great euphoric inspiration was abound in my head and I felt great.  Then around dinner time I began to feel far less euphoric.  The percocet had begun to wan and in another hour I felt that it left my head completely.  I was still quite doped up from the methadone, and the adderoll was still keeping me energetic.  Eventually I began to feel a little dizzy and sick again, probably from the adderoll and methdone waning off.  Regardless, I got a lot of work done and felt very good about the state of my research.<br/>
<br/>
I guess you could say that I use the work as an excuse to justify my drug use, but it is not.  I have never been a heavy opiate user and with the exception of the couple weeks after I had my surgery I never really binged on them.  I prefer psychedelic drugs for the most part and as drug experiences in themselves I think they are more enlightening than any opiate could ever be.  I have just always had a habit of doing school work while high.  I did it consistantly throughout high school, aand did very well.  <br/>
<br/>
In conclusion:  Everyone reacts differently to drugs in the short term and and long term.  I have been fortunate enough to create a positive relationship with drugs for the most part.  I try to use them for good in my life some of the time rather than just getting high and sitting around.  As a prosepctive writer I try to combine periods of sober writing/editing with intoxicated ones.  The change in perspective has always helped me with writing, even if it is an acedemic essay.  Regardless, be careful with combining uppers and opiates.  I have never had bad experiences with the combination, but there are always times during the experience where I feel dizzy and sick.  Other friends of mine have vomited before from the combination.  Both drugs make my stomach turn to some degree.<!-- End Body -->
