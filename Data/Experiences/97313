My,o my…this was certainly an interesting set of eyes inside to say the least.  The first compound I’ve experienced that concentrated solely on self, or rather, “self” both physically and eternally. Very introspective.<br/>
<br/>
That day, we woke and began preparing for take-off by avoiding coffee (a challenge for me), drinking herbal tea, some meditation, some fresh fruit and then a little cannabis.  With a stimulant such as AMT, we knew it was important to avoid any inorganic and organic stimulus-enabling situations and tailored our inner and outer environments to be as chill as possible.  An ideal way to start any day!<br/>
<br/>
Around 2:34pm, we began.  I received that excitement feeling after about 15 minutes (which happens right before and right after I dose anything) also referred to as the placebo effect.<br/>
<br/>
It is difficult to verbalize the onset of AMT as it began to really set in…I’ll do my best:<br/>
<br/>
Coming on extremely slow, I began feeling the AMT wiggle behind the eyes, it seemed.  An unfamiliar,  yet friendly tickle.  About 1 hour later, I found myself looking in awe at my hands and how grateful  to them I was,  my lungs felt HUGE, a yawn every now and then was the most satisfying sensation.  I felt that my peripheral  vocabulary widening; I could “see” in 360 degrees in once sense or another.  <br/>
<br/>
Maybe 3-4 hours later, my appetite was a million light years away, but, of course I couldn’t drink enough water.  Cotton mouth was extraordinarily prevalent.  No visuals other than heightened clarity and more detail to objects than usual yet colors were more opaque/pastel.   Oddly enough, my heart rate stayed seemingly normal.   I felt confusion, a little disorienting but motivated and eager to paint, write, make soothing-type noises with my vocal chords (which felt really good).  Physical sensations were comparable to MDMA.  Much laughter.  My body insisted on lots of slow, deep breaths, which again, felt so so good.  The main characteristic AMT delivered was the mind being very into the body.  A beautiful partnership;  very primitive and basic. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">The main characteristic AMT delivered was the mind being very into the body.  A beautiful partnership;  very primitive and basic.</div></div>  Simplistic.  Peaceful.<br/>
<br/>
As far as my mental goings on, I could not focus on one thought.  It was very meta-thought.  I could only think of the entity of thought instead of the body of the thought.  A very Taoist embodiment of experience.   Set and setting, like with all compounds, are very important.   This compound is great for solo-tripping considering all the introspection in the happenings of it.  Although, I also enjoyed my close group of friends and in deep nature.<br/>
<br/>
In closing, these entheogens are so sacred and require the utmost respect and exist as the cord to our ancestors, our roots, what we really are, and how we can heal and attain full awakening. I mean that in the finest of details to the widest sense of the word; heal.  Much love and in the words of Hopi elders,<br/>
“Banish the word struggle from your attitude and your vocabulary.  All that we do now must be done in a sacred manner and in celebration.  We are the ones we've been waiting for.”<!-- End Body -->
