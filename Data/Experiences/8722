9:34pm<BR>
(T-0:00h)<BR>

Just dosed, the smell reminds me of 2ct7, not something easily forgotten. Powder taking orally, 40mg in a shotglass. Nothing happening too much now, smoked 2 bowls of weed about 3 hours ago, but pretty much down now from the effects. The normal pre-trip jitters are occuring: beating heart, a bit anxious, etc.<BR>
<BR>
9:52pm<BR>
(T-0:18h)<BR>
<BR>
It's really hot out here, and i'm not sure if im just noticing it now or if it has been going on this whole time, but im definitely starting to sweat and noticing it getting more humid in my room.<BR>
<BR>
10:07pm<BR>
(T-0:33h)<BR>
<BR>
Water and relaxing with the fan on helped out, just making sure i remember to keep myself hydrated.<BR>
<BR>
10:16pm<BR>
(T-0:42h)<BR>
<BR>
A bit of jaw shaking is occuring, not sure if this is from being anxious or if its actually starting.<BR>
<BR>
10:26pm<BR>
(T-0:52h)<BR>
<BR>
Jaw shaking even more noticable now, somethings definitely starting.<BR>
<BR>
10:45pm<BR>
(T-1:11h)<BR>
<BR>
Somewhere around this time i puked, i noticing nausea getting worse and worse and while my friend was over i ended up letting it all loose into the toilet. after this however i felt much better and was ready to start enjoying the trip.<BR>
<BR>
1:42am<BR>
(T-4:08h)<BR>
<BR>
A friend showed up and we played some GranTurismo3 for a bit, the game was more fun than i could have imagined. We rode around for a bit just cruising. when he would get up to 100+mph the road dissolved into a thin line, everything one big blur. Jaw hasn't really stopped since it started a few hours ago. the visuals aren't that intense, but they seem like it keeps growing in intensity as the time passes.<BR>
<BR>
2:04am<BR>
(T-4:30h)<BR>
<BR>
Weed helped.. alot. I love how pot has a special synergy between other drugs, damn near most of em. ....   hm, Yup.. definitely helped : )<BR>
<BR>
2:07am<BR>
(T-4:33h)<BR>
<BR>
Closed eye visuals are amazing, rolling hills and valleys of checkerboard black and white.. going to ed rush & opitcal in the background playing. I'm also starting to get alot of eye wiggles.<BR>
<BR>
2:25am<BR>
(T-4:51h)<BR>
<BR>
Yes, yes i still love weed. I drew for a bit, (which i haven't done since senior year over a year ago.) its a really interesting picture right now, who knows what it will look like tommorow but that doesn't matter.<BR>
<BR>
2:43am<BR>
(T-5:09h)<BR>
<BR>
Took a hot shower, it felt great. i could see canyons made by the streams off the shower head. it was awesome. a then danced for a bit and i was so more tuned into the music i couldn't imagine. out of nowhere i could magically start dancing to drum and bass. cool shit<BR>
<BR>
5:20am<BR>
(T-7:26h)<BR>
<BR>
After my last post i was basically on a comedown.. not too much of a traditional mind fuck like other pyschedlics, but my inner monolugue was much more pronounced. i decided to take 10mg percocet to ease the ride down so i could sleep tommorow and get to work. After the perc's kicked in, i was much more content with just laying down and watching Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Also, when i opened this new drawer i was using for my 'stuff', it sent like a bolt of energy through me, but i immediatly looked down at the bible that was also in the drawer. (out of practice for a while, never even thought about it). <BR>
<BR>
6:30am<BR>
(T-8:36h)<BR>
<BR>
Somewhere around this time i finally passed out, i slept great until about 11:30am when i woke up out of nowhere, slight visuals still occuring (mostly just tracers). i tossed and turned for the next hour trying to sleep but my mind wouldn't shutup. i got up and put some food in my stomache and tried sleeping once again. i dozed off and on until 3:00pm when i had to get up to get ready for work.<BR>
<BR>
Afterthoughts: <BR>
<BR>
Well, in the end, was it a positive experience? Definitely. i should have smoked weed a lot sooner but my parents weren't home yet and i didnt' want to be right in the middle of it while they came home. i'm a bit disappointed in that i didn't really feel any of the rolling effects that i read about. the first few hours i had mostly tracers and some breathing of the walls and color shifting, as well as decent body sensations but nothing really close to rolling. it wasn't until i smoked weed that i was really tripping face, to the point where communication was getting difficult. up until this point i was pretty much on the ball. I liked the experience a lot but next time i'll have to look into something that will knock me out when i want to end the trip, the perc's worked well to calm me down and allow me to relax, and i think they also allowed me to to get a decent 5 hours of sleep.<!-- End Body -->
