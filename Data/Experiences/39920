IT all started when my mom and aunt decided to go to cedar point for a few days.  my cousin told me about this drug he could get for cheep that would trip me the fuck out. So he got a 34 mg hit and bought me a 26 mg hit. <br>
<br>
So we waited till the second day were at cedar point, the parents were at the park and bars drinking so we didn't think they'd be back for a while and we had the hotel to our selfs. it was 5:15 pm and we ate our 2-CI and went to ride some rides. At about 6:10 i felt it kick in and i didn't feel much at all. <br>
<br>
We waited in line for a ride and by the time we got to the front i started seeing every thing that i've never seen at the park before. it seemed like every one was looking at me and they were all like aliens, just different i don't know how to put it,and it bothered the shit out of me. <br>
<br>
We finally got on the ride and i started freeking out. we were on the menilium force and i had no idea what the hell i was doing strapped in a chair going really, really high into the air. i looked down and it seemed like the roller coaster was falling and bending to the ground and i freeked out and started yelling that the ride was braking and we were going to die.  <br>
<br>
After the ride i made my cuzin take me back to the hotel room because i hated being around people. we got to our room went on the balcony and smoked 3 grams of opium and im not sure how many joints. after we went back to our room and i layed on the bed and there were swirls that were on the ceiling of the room. it was awesome. after that i sat in front of the curtains in front of the window and it was the coolest thing in the world.<br>
<br>
15 min later my parents walked into the hotel room and i was able to act perfectly normal even though i was still on my peak. we went on some more rides and let our trip die. That was the best experience i have ever had no hang overs, not mood swing.<!-- End Body -->
