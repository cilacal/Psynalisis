I've always been a fan of acid and shrooms, so when I saw the video 'Flashback' it really got me wanting to try 5-MeO-DMT.  None of my friends have ever tried it, so I found a website and ordered 100mgs using my mom's credit card.  Less than a week later it came in the mail.  I had enough for 10 10mg trips   so i promised a few of my friends I'd let em try it out.  <br>
<br>
The day after it came me and my best friends Andrew and Mitch were getting stoned before going to mall as we do all the time.  Only this time would be a little bit different on the count of I had the 5-MeO-DMT with me.  Since Mitch was the one driving he didn't want to do any, so me and Andrew tried smoking it out of my chillium with not much success on the count of the big crystal we had in the bowl melted,  needless to say however we did get a hit.  <br>
<br>
Not fealing much we just said fuck it and went in to a burger king bathroom, crushed the rest of the crystals to a powder, and cut it up into 2 lines.  I sniffed one line and Andrew's stupid ass laughed and blew his everywhere, thus leaving me the only one to be fucked up.  The drip was horrible.  I use cocaine from time to time and absolutly love a coke drip   but this drip tasted disgusting and burned the back of my throat. <br>
<br>
It soon kicked in and I was describing the drip to Andrew and Mitch as 'It fealt like little creatures drilling holes in the back of my throat.'  I fealt good but that didn't last long.  Soon my face started turning bright red then the fact that I bumped 50 mgs on top of taking a hit of that when all you're supposed to take is 10 so I became very paranoid I was going to die.  Time slowed down times ten. I was sooo out of it that it took all the concentration I had to get my phone out of my pockit to hand it to Andrew.  <br>
<br>
Talking yet still making sence was also very hard too.  I was terrified i was going to die, and since time seemed like it was slowing down I was sure that was it.  I was going to overdose on 5-MeO-DMT in a Burger King.  But after what seemed like 5 minutes (but in actuality was 40) I started to mellow out, thus when the actual tripping part kicked in.  It fealt like my eye started to melt  and drip down my face like tears   and I could see the color of my eyes running down my face but nothing was there when I went to wipe it off which I found funny. And when I talked, I'd see the right part of my bottom lip stretch out really far in front of me.  Also my ear fealt like it was slowly sliding down my head and onto my shoulder.  <br>
<br>
Around the time the tripping started to kick in, I had fealt like I was at my peak of 10 e pills.  (E is my FAVORITE drug by the way)  It was amazing how I fealt, to this day I can't even describe it.  Everything seemeed so perfect and my mind was overflowing with the most amazing sentences I thought could ever be spoken.  And when i came down off the trip, I didn't feal like shit like when you come down off most drugs.  I didn't have any out of body expieriences or travel to a different world, but then again I was too concerned I was going to overdose, not to mention in a resteraunt full of ppl who were staring at me like I was on drugs.  <br>
<br>
So next time I'll start out small, then do more if I'm not as fucked up as I'd like to be.  Also, I'll do it with ppl I trust and will calm me down if I start to panic, not people who will just make fun of me making things worse.  And I won't go to a public place because I in no way can act at all sober on this drug.  Since then I havn't used any, but I'm ordering 200 mgs soon and sticking with 25-30mg doses.<!-- End Body -->
