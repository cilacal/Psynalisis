I used Xanax recreationally to help me get through the stress of daily life and it worked quite well, allthough even off of two in the morning I got a feeling as if I have had maybe 2-3 beers.<BR>
<BR>
So I came home from a hard day at work stressed out and looking to relieve some tension because I was so stressed out.  I was low on cash and my boss and me had got in a fight and I didn't know if I would have a job to come back to come Tuesday so I needed a break.<BR>
<BR>
I thought of what I could do and headed towards the medicine cabinet and saw 3 bottles: Percocet, Vicodin, and Xanax.  Allthough the oxycodone sure did sound mighty tempting I thought of a high dosage of Xanax:<BR>
<BR>
T+00:00- 20 pink .5mg pills, I took four swallows of 5 each and then.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 20 min- I noticed that my body was starting to groan, my stomach was a little burny but it was nothing unmanageable.  I drank some water as my throat was getting a little dry.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 40 min- I was getting quite drowsy now, but it wasn't as if I wanted to sleep, my eyelids felt very heavy and when my limbs moved they felt extremly heavy, I had trouble walking in a straight line and lost balance and fell over a few times<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1 hour- My whole body felt like liquid, I couldn't hold a straight thought for more than a few seconds, I would walk somewhere to do something and forget where I was.  It is somewhat comparable to being drunk, but I dont get quite the Euphoria I do with alchohol, which is what I enjoy most.<BR>
<BR>
I was almost motionless as any movement would result in me falling over so I just tried to sit and watch T.V. I sat down for about 5 minutes, then before I knew it, it was 19 hours later, I woke up with the TV still on and I felt very groggy, it was dark out but I was confused about the time until I realised it was the next day, I don't remember falling asleep or anything and I was somewhat dissapointed that all I got out of it was a nice 20 hour sleep.<BR>
<BR>
Next time I want to 'try' to be constantly on the move and with a trip-sitter to make sure I don't fall asleep and miss my trip.  This is quite an interesting drug, It gives you a relaxation different from all other benzos *I think* but even on low dosages I get very unmotiviated so I dont find it I can do it daily like meth.<!-- End Body -->
