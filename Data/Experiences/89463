<!-- Start Body -->
Tripping with my close friend tonight. She will be taking 15mg of Adderall XR and a total 3.3g of Psilocybin mushrooms (which she has experience with) over the course of a few hours.<br/>
<br/>
21:30: 15mg of Adderall XR ingested.<br/>
23:50-00:20: 30g (30 gel caps) of powdered Peruvian Torch consumed over the course of half an hour to avoid stress on the stomach from expansion of all the gel caps.<br/>
<br/>
Time is now started from 00:00 (last gel cap consumed).<br/>
<br/>
T+00:30. I feel very loopy and spacey. Kind of like I'm on a boat on the waves; the way the boat rocks back and forth and affects my balance and level perception. Starting to feel strong surges of energy in and all over my body. Partly convinced that it's the Adderall and placebo effect. Noticing some peripheral tracers and blurred trails from quick movement. Need to shit is imminent but is slightly difficult. Odors are overwhelming and much more noticeable than usual. I feel disgusted and get out of the bathroom quickly.<br/>
<br/>
T+00:50. Writing is becoming difficult. Everything I look at is starting to get a 'breathing' look to it. Shrinking and expanding, growing. Colors are off, dull and almost black and white one moment; only to become bright, vibrant and pronounced the next. Also having to take heavy breaths to help relax with the come up (and the hyperactivity of the Adderall). Heavy breathing is shaky, but not labored. Heart rate is high and strong. Easily felt by touching my chest. Music in the background (Ozric Tentacles - The Yumyum Tree) is becoming much more pronounced and heightened. The two small speakers are now sounding like a surround sound system, ambient. Slight onset of nausea.<br/>
<br/>
T+01:10. Urge to purge, 30 second window. I walk briskly to the bathroom. Try to breathe it out, no point. Vomit once, vomit twice. I feel immediately better and flush the toilet. Rinse mouth with some water, and then some mouthwash. I still feel slight nausea but I feel comfortable. A freckle leaps off my hand and back onto it. Visuals are now much more pronounced and in my line of sight. Colors are now more prominently losing color then 're-colorizing.'<br/>
<br/>
T+01:45. Have to get some fresh air. Desire to go outside. Walking and traversing terrain is confusing and difficult. Outside almost feels too open and expansive. High rise buildings seem monolithic, looming and obstructive. People (the public) feel like they're 'pressing in'. Unpredictable. Not terrified by any means, just unnerved. We go back to her apartment and the air once again feels stagnant. Slight nausea returns. Having the windows open helps tremendously.<br/>
<br/>
T+02:15. Raw, animalistic sexual tendencies. Suddenly aware that I have a penis. I go to the bathroom to caress myself. Cannot get an erection, though I feel very sexual. Too distracted to care. I go back to other things.<br/>
<br/>
T+02:30. Anything mechanical (lights, fixtures, appliances) makes a lot of sound. Very loud and noticeable. The whole place feels alive with clicks, ticks and humming. Music is formed by the collaboration of these sounds. Bubbles rising in my glass of Ginger Ale can be heard loud and clear from a good distance. Nausea is nonexistent.<br/>
<br/>
T+03:00. I am now writing from memory and not from log. I was unable to write anything down from here on as I was in full swing of my trip and unable to focus on writing things down, though I could explain what was happening to me in speech at the time. I went to the balcony and looked up at the stars. The glimmering stars were shooting lines back and forth to one another to form constellations, right in front of my very eyes. It was visually arresting. Things are crawling out from under things only to retreat back to hiding again. I keep thinking there's a scurrying animal but there is none.<br/>
<br/>
T+04:00. I sit in a chair and lose myself in the ceiling and in the carpet. Complex visual patterns are created from sectional pieces of foreground and background. Closed eye visuals are incredible and completely illogical. Full color spectrum is seen with eyes closed. Psychedelic patterns and waves. Random things are copied tenfold and spun around or flowing, tunneled, flashing.Impossible to describe.<br/>
<br/>
T+06:00. I lay down and feel incredibly comfortable and cuddly. I feel a body high very similar to MDMA. Very stimulating and relaxing. My friend turns on a glitter lava lamp in the dark. It casts the most incredible reflections on the ceiling. Flowing shapes and patterns that seem to make perfect sense. I can only describe it as pure beauty.<br/>
<br/>
T+08:00. I am still watching the lamp cast visuals upon the ceiling. Looking at the lamp itself is pure bliss. The lamp is crystal clear and everything is defined, detailed and swirling one fleeting moment, then blurred and expansive the next. The crystals flake outside of the the glass then roll back into the lamp. Glowing orbs of light are vibrant and warm, swirling and rolling. The lamp looks as though it harbors life itself. <br/>
<br/>
T+09:00. I can feel myself coming down very slowly, body high wise. The visuals are still the same. I have been having deep emotional and philosophical conversations with my friend and it is very bonding and very enjoyable. Her otherwise dark brown eyes are a bright, reflective crystal blue. I am astounded at the color of her eyes, for the closer I look directly at them, they remain blue and bright. It is a complete visual lie, for that is not the color of her eyes at all. She looks like a different person in many ways. Her ponytail hair looks dread-lock like and blurred. Her solid black wristband is glowing blue and red. Every time she makes a facial expression I see the face of another woman. It is visually profound.<br/>
<br/>
T+12:00. I've had a few times now where I thought I had reached sobriety, only to have my visuals explode back into full swing just by the thought of what I had remembered seeing. Incredible.<br/>
<br/>
My body high had come down so gradually over the course of hours that it was actually very relaxing and welcoming. I had spent hours talking to my friend about our lives and it was very bonding for the two of us. The only words I could use to describe to her what I felt and saw in the last few hours were 'beauty' and 'bliss.' The sun had now risen. I stuck my head out the window and the fresh morning air had made me feel reborn. The smell and taste of the air was so clean and crisp, it was incredibly nostalgic and uplifting.<br/>
<br/>
T+13:00+ I lapsed in and out of sleep and had reached a fairly level state of sobriety.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, this experience was more profound than any substance I have experienced. It was life changing. The experience lasts a very long time. It is said to be 8-10 hours, but for me I was still experiencing dramatic effects after 12 hours. The experience seemed to be a myriad of other substances with some visuals comparable to mushrooms, a body high comparable to MDMA, and a dissociative effect like Salvia. However it was a profound experience all in it's own. It is the first time I've ever used the word 'Spiritual.'<!-- End Body -->
