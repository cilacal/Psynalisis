Well once again we had a chem crew party at my house.. That was the spot No adults No bullshit just a bunch of friends and a shit load of drugs. We had 3 grams of Amt,Ketamine and some bud-between 5 people- I make everyone a dose of amt..Now I was used to eating 65mgs and I wasnt impressed with the affects so I said we are all taking 90!<br>
<br>
No one objected to it. We all downed our pills and waited. I was so excited I wanted to watch their faces as it hit them. We waited for almost 2hrs had went by when I felt that firmiliar tingle that always surges up and down my spine when the amt is about to take hole.. I was so happy it was starting to kick in..Everyone else had started their journeys. This sensation lasted for about 20 more minutes before..The cops came and kicked in the fucking door...RAID<br>
<br>
I'm not going to get into extreme detail as to what else happened. I just know we were all arrested and taken to jail until they figured out what we were on and where the drugs were. No one said shit to the cops which pissed them off. Even if a friend of mine had known where the chems were they wouldnt tell. They didnt find anything in my house. After Realizing we were all minors they started calling parents..Since it was apparent we were all fucked up we were taken to the hospital. Last thing I remember was punching a nurse for coming near me with a needle...I like amt-its pretty cool the smell is awful but.. Some affects are rockin`!!<!-- End Body -->
