In all began June 30, of 2003 and I began the day off right as usual and I was excited because tonight was going to be a night I would soon never forget. Tonight was the Detroit Electronic Festival. I met up with some of my friends and I had a vial with 65mg of 2ct-7 in it. My buddy and I picked up 2 of his friends and 2 of them were trippin on a bag of about 12 grams of shrooms and my other friend was eating 2 blue omega 'E' pills. I usually mess with the intense stuff and boy was I in for a treat. My buddies did their thing and consumed their products, but me you could say I was intimidated and that is unusual. Usually I'm fearless but responsible.<br>
<br>
(7:00pm) Anyways I pulled in a Store to get h2o and while my buddy was rollin up a 'L' I laid out about 50mg of 2ct-7 on a cd case. I laid it and licked it up. On the way to Detroit which is about 35 minute drive I began feeling the effects. We pulled into the parking garage and then it hit me square in the face. I took one last hit off my friend's pipe and we made our journey to the excitement. We were fucked up already and got lost in the parking garage. We finally reached the ground level and made our way to Hart plaza in downtown Detroit. The music was very intense. If you've never been there let me describe it a little bit. It's a park and there's almost a 1,000,000 people there during the weekend and there's about 100 booths with a DJ at each one playing something different. Then there is 7 main stages with popular and famous DJs spinning.<br>
<br>
(8:00) Back to the night we enter and my heart is already pounding and I'm having trouble focusing. We began to wander and watch all the wackos that Detroit has to offer. We found a nice little spot and sat down to prevent heat exhaustion and nausea. I began to look around and soon realize that everything is in a deep swirl and the trails are delayed about 5 to 7 seconds and this in the first 2 hours.<br>
<br>
(10:00) I began watching a police officer dance around and actually make an ass out of himself. I'm wondering if I'm tripping or this is real. This is in a period of about 20 minutes of complete isolation between my friends and I soon snap out of my little trance and I'm like am I trippin or is there a cop freaking hoes. Anyways we move on and I'm starting to get sick a little bit because my brain feels like its gunna explode. People's heads are waving around because of my trails and my hearing is so bad I can't make out what anyone is saying. Well the night goes on and I'm in utter believe that I'm trippin this hard. I can't really explain my feelings and effects because anyone that's experienced knows that, so let me just briefly describe a few things that happened. Some girls try to hit on me and my friends and I can't even think I'm so wacked. I just try to get by without making a fool of my self because I can barely speak. <br>
<br>
I began to look around and just see wacked the fuck out people everywhere and just when I thought I saw it all and there was nothing else a black bum with no legs approaches me with no teeth and ripped clothes in a wheelchair and sticks his hands out and says 'Can you spare some change'....I laugh in his face and yell I'm wacked the fuck out. I look around and began feeling the feeling in my stomach whenever I'm tripping real hard. I start to walk and my friends follow. I look around and all I see is people. I glance over and this kid is dancing and his head is waving around almost touching his shoulders and he says something and is sounds like bluuuuuuuu....bluuuuuuu... bluuuuuuuuu and then I get real sick and I feel like I'm gunna vomit. <br>
<br>
I begin to run threw a crowd of probaly 100,000 trying not to puke in front of all these people. I finally find a wall of about 5 feet and climb it. There's grass and I run about 50 ft with vomit in my mouth and finally find the right spot and let it go. I then puke over this wall. I sit there and try to recuperate. <br>
<br>
(11:00) I finally regain myself enough to walk away. I then look around and I can't see. Everything is so blurry that I can't see 5 ft in front of me. I start freaking out because I think I'm lost in all these people. I get my cell phone out but no luck because I can't see the screen. I try calling people but none of them were my friends. I couldnt make out who I was calling. Finally I try to look around for them but I can't see them anywhere. It's been about 20 minutes and I'm like fuck it I'll just go find something to do 'I'm wacked out of my mind'. Then I get one of those moments when everything besides one thing becomes blurry and I see my friends and they were right in front of me the whole time. I walk up to them and there like is that the first time you saw us and I'm like yea I cant see. They're like you were looking at us the whole time. Anyways we meet up with all my other friends and there all drunk and I'm just not feeling the vibe. I wanted to be alone so I could just wonder into space. Soon my trails are seriously delayed like 10 to 12 seconds it seemed.<br>
<br>
(2:00) I soon say to my friends I can't take this shit anymore take me home. I get into the car and we smoke a fat blunt on the way home. I get to my house and my mom's sleeping. I sat down on my couch and the TV was on. I soon watch it and all the letters on the music choice channel began to melt along with a man's face. Everything is in rainbow colors. I make my way through my crib to my room in the basement. I sit there and roll up a joint and I begin to smoke it. I reach in my pocket and there's about 15mg left of this stuff. I think to myself I'm already fucking krunked, I might as well eat it.<br>
<br>
(3:00) So I did. Then I just sat in my room stairing at things having some intense visualizations. I look at my cat sitting on a chair and everything but her face gets blurry and it feels like she moved back 50 ft and her face looks like a clown. She began laughing at me and I'm fucking freaking out. I lay in my bed and close my eyes. I soon began getting closed eye hallucinations. It was like a Kalidoscope of all different shapes and colors. And then finally at about 6:30 I passed out.<!-- End Body -->
