I have recently been experimenting with research chemicals and am pleased to say that I have found an online vendor who supplies pure chemicals in discreet packaging. Recently I have tried MPA, ethylphenidate and isopropylphenidate, which are all stimulants similar in effects to amphetamine. I also take prescription medication including sertraline which is a selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitor.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span><br/>
<br/>
THE EXPERIENCE<br/>
I started my IPPD experiment by carding out a thin line and then dividing that in two. Sorry, I cannot tell you the exact quantity, but it was what most regular stimulant-users would describe as a 'bump'. I used a roll of paper to snort it then started a stopwatch. There was some burning/itchiness and a faint odour but not as much as with ethylphenidate. <br/>
<br/>
15 minutes later there was no noticeable effect. My nose felt fine, no more itchiness and just a little drip at the back of my nose/throat. It didn't taste bad unlike other RCs I have tried (eg nitracaine).<br/>
<br/>
30 minutes after dosing, still no noticeable effect.<br/>
<br/>
45 minutes - I felt something. A slight amphetamine-type buzz and the urge to re-dose. So, I snorted the other half of the line.<br/>
<br/>
1 hour - I felt more lively and chatty and in a sociable mood. I visited my housemate, taking a bottle of Bolivian coca-leaf liqueur with me. I shared the IPPD with my friend.<br/>
<br/>
Over the next 8 hours, we shared the gram of IPPD, dosing approximately every 45 minutes, single lines. The lines were fairly thin lines approximately 3 or 4 inches in length.<br/>
<br/>
2 hours - I felt a very noticeable rush, elevation in mood, and increased sociability. I did not feel on edge. In fact, my restless leg syndrome had stopped completely (probably due to an increase in dopamine) and i felt energetic but relaxed and confident. So, at this point I was very much enjoying the experience. My friend remarked that it was like taking amphetamine and I agreed. By this point my friend was clearly 'high' and 'chewing' but there was no pupil dilation nor any other physical signs other than tension in the jaw. Personally, I have learned to resist the urge to chew, so apart from my enthusiasm you probably would not suspect I had taken a stimulant.<br/>
<br/>
Over the next few hours, I drank the entire bottle of Bolivian Agwa de Coca with tonic water and lime. My friend preferred to drink Belgian beer (aren't we decadent?!).<br/>
<br/>
The rest of the night is unclear in my memory except to say that we were both surprised at 3 in the morning that time had passed so quickly. Our conversation had been interesting and ranged over many topics. We were able to discuss contentious topics intelligently and amicably without once becoming irritated or defensive. There was no paranoia. In fact, by the end of the evening we both agreed that we felt closer as friends and hugged each other. This was not really due to any noticeable entactogenic effects of the IPPD but rather a consequence of the sparkling conversation and happy mood.<br/>
<br/>
I would say this is probably going to become a popular substance in universities, both as a social/club drug and as a nootropic study aid. I should mention that my friend was able to work throughout the evening on an illustrator project. So, in summary, I would describe isopropylphenidate as an amphetamine-type substance with all of the mood-enhancing and concentration benefits. A social drug and a nootropic. <br/>
<br/>
THE COMEDOWN<br/>
Neither my friend nor I slept a wink that night. My friend went to work as usual and had a productive day despite feeling 'tired and wired'.<br/>
<br/>
I had a terrible hangover (probably due to drinking a bottle of liqueur rather than the IPPD). I felt restless and tense. I had a slight stomach ache and didn't want to eat. I felt dehydrated so sipped water throughout the day. In the evening, my housemate brought some fast food and I was able to enjoy the meal, although I didn't feel like finishing it and immediately afterwards rushed to the loo.<br/>
<br/>
That night I went to bed early, feeling exhausted. I slept fitfully, waking every few hours drenched in perspiration, my quilt and pillows soaked through. My friend had the same symptoms.<br/>
<br/>
More disturbingly, today I have had difficulty urinating and, when I do squeeze some out, it is painful and contains blood. This has never happened to me before, even during my years of ketamine addiction. It is slightly better after a relaxing bath but still painful.<br/>
<br/>
So, if you had asked me when I was taking the IPPD whether I would recommend it, I would have certainly recommended it enthusiastically. However, after the comedown, I would not. I preferred the IPPD high to other research chemicals but taking the physical comedown into account, I would have to recommend caution. <br/>
MPA is probably my favourite of the current crop of 'legal' research chemicals.<!-- End Body -->
