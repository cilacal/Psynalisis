<br>
Okay so me an two friends decided to trip balls one night on some 10 mg 2c-e capsules, i've done mescaline, mushrooms, lsa, lsd, and 2c-b  but nothing prepared me for this night.<br>
<br>
We started off taking 50 mg a piece 6 capsules an hour later one of my friends started tripping but me and my buddy had nothing not even a body buzz, so we ate 5 more apiece. Waited about 30 more minutes and I started to have light visual hallucinations and was like are you fucking kidding me this is all, so we snorted one... wrong move.<br>
 <br>
Well me at this point my one buddy who had started tripping before us was hiding balled up in the corner of the room under his blanket scared for his life, I found it kinda funny but little did i know three hours later i'd be in the same place.<br>
 <br>
Okay so lets get to it I'm tripping real hard watching pink floyds the wall next thing i know i feel like im about three feet tall my bodys completely numb i mean i took a lit cigarette an placed it on my arm and counted to ten before i even started to feel it burn an in my head im like wow so now i know what my buddy over theres freaking out.  <br>
<br>
Next thing i know i stand up to walk out side and it just feels like i got hit by a train and i hit the ground, while my one buddys just sittin in front of me like what the fuck laughin his ass off and i just preceded to go to a different world   everything turned white i couldnt hear nothing but i could still see peoples mouths moving, i was like what the fucks going on is this normal, which freaked me the fuck out so i just balled up and  closed my eyes.<br>
 <br>
Well while my eyes were closed for about a total of 3 hours my life flashed before my eyes i saw all my experiences from childhood until now. At this point i didn't know what to think, i guess i thought i was dying. <br>
 <br>
At this point i open my eyes again to see myself sitting in the kitchen barstool like how the hell did i get up here and i looked over the bartop and down on the floor my body was still lying balled up, and i glanced around the room to see that i wasnt the only one balled up freaked out all three of us were. <br>
 <br>
At this point i guess my brain shut my body down cause i dont remember nothing after this point.<br>
 <br>
Next thing I know im waking up to the cold water of my shower hitting my body an i didn't know what was going on i opened my eyes and everything had this white flare coming off of it and its ust morphing and i look up to see my roommates face just looking down at me like are you okay i walked inside and saw you laying on the floor shaking unconscious an this was the only way i could wake you up.<br>
 <br>
By now it was around 2 a.m and i was still tripping balls watching comedy central presents dane cook, but it was a completely different trip nice no out of body experieces nothing hard just peaceful and funny i laughed my ass off with my roommate for the rest of the night and finally around 4 a.m my friend arises from his corner his trip was over he slept it off not mine though i was still going thinking damn is this ever gonna stop at this point i didn't care it was nice i had forgot all about earlier.  <br>
 <br>
Anyways not much more happened that morning i just watched movies and bugged out.  I finally stopped tripping around 10 a.m and i went to sleep.<br>
 <br>
That night scared the shit out of me in a way and i haven't tripped since because i still think about what the fuck happened to me that night an i dont want it to happen again.   I still don't know why i had that experience or what caused me to have it but i know one thing for sure no more 2c-e for me.<!-- End Body -->
