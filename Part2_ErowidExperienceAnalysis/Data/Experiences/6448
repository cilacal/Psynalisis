It has been a dark few weeks for me. Independent of any known motivation, I have felt a weight upon me for some time. Only recently I had a rather dark experience during my meditation. It was many events that lead me to take one more dose of 2ct7. I have attempted the substance thrice before, each time seemed inappropriate and hastily organised. However, this one time the experience was well set, and even though way down in my subconscious I had some doubt, the adventure took place.<BR>
<BR>
It is always difficult to add something special to a report, to make it stand out. The experience itself seemed to stand out little, yet at the same time the experience has left its own mark on me. Perhaps it is a sign that I have over done my exploration.<BR>
<BR>
I had set out during this experience to take a look at the things that had been bothering me. With an nervous and tense mindset I ingested the substance. It was 9:00 PM, in a nice warm comfortable home, with various other friends and aquaintances. Only one close friend was diving into the experience, others were left to watch us swim. R, my friend had ingested 20mg, she too has had other experiences.<BR>
<BR>
The experience started off uninterestingly. On other previous doses I had a nice relaxed lift off, this time however, I remained aware of a subtle anxiety. We decided to put on Alice in Wonderland, that seemed to do little to stimulate me, the film felt superficial, with little content that inspired any passionate feelings. <BR>
<BR>
As the substance began to take effect, I senses an extremely hot flushing sensation on my face. My perception of time was warped. As the experience continued, little of any unique value presented itself. <BR>
<BR>
I took myself to a room away from the others, turning inwards I found I could relax and enjoy the area around me. Then after I turned on one of my favourite CD's, I lay on the floor writhing in pleasure. From the point onwards many insights came to mind, many thoughts of realisation and significance presented themselves. The bliss was extraordinary, flowing through me like the ocean over a sandy beach. I felt the bliss begin, overwhelm and recede for many cycles.<BR>
<BR>
I looked at my darker sides, and that act also brought realizations and insight about me into mind.<BR>
<BR>
Walking outside during the night brought many wonderful sights and sounds into my awareness. The feelings slowly crept away, until I was left with nothing.<BR>
<BR>
I sit here now, looking over my experience, thinking of the feelings once present. Those visions seem faded, those thoughts unmotivating. What has changed? Where did it all go? <BR>
<BR>
It is this period of time that is the hardest in attempting to understand the experience. So far little has been learned, little integrated. It is this inability to make sense of the expressions felt in blissful states that has brought me to write this. I hope for my own, and others sake, that these feelings are relevant. <BR>
<BR>
Have I resolved the issues I sought to? It does not seem like it, will I ever, I don't know.<BR>
<BR>
My condolences go out to the people related to those who have died in regards to this substance. I cannot begin to make sense of my experiences, let alone such profoundly consequential events.<BR>
<BR>
Peace...<!-- End Body -->
