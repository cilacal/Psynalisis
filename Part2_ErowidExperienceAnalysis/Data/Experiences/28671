Experiment #1	>>	November 7, 2003, 8:30pm<BR>
<BR>

Appearance >> 		Light & dark beige crystals<BR>
Amount >>		10mg<BR>
Method >> 		Smoked<BR>
<BR>
				<BR>
Sitting with four friends during the Harmonic Concordance and the Lunar eclipse, I free-based 10mg of ‘5-MeO-DMT’ for the first time. Cross-legged on the grass, I exhaled every last bit of air from my lungs, put the tube to my lips and took a long, slow inhalation. Head moved upright and hands in my lap to meditate, I held my breath for about 30 seconds and the first effects came with light-headedness and a jelly-like sensation in my body, somewhat similar to mushrooms or LSD. Not a moment later, a huge wave of unmistakable transition swept upwards from my legs and throughout my entire being/existence, leaving me in void: another dimension one cannot see but is omnipresent.<BR>
<BR>
Senses were mutated: it sounded like all the air around me was being sucked by a vacuum, ending with something like the familiar sound of a seashell, but as if I was inside of it; vision was a bit blurred, objects lost their edges and some of my view space was now nothing but shadow. It seemed as if I were looking into the 4th dimension, I recognized things but also saw beyond them or inside of them; I don’t remember feeling the ground, still sitting cross-legged. I recognized my breathing and it was okay. I felt oneness with everything, and love emanating everywhere. I smiled wide.<BR>
<BR>
I had to take a glimpse of the lunar eclipse while under this amazing force, so I tried to stand up (not recommended). I was successful but very wobbly in the process; I stayed close to the ground with arms out for two steps then had to seek help from a nearby patio chair. If there were no chair, I probably would have toppled over. I managed to see the eclipse, though it didn’t hold my interest too long, I just kept looking around at everything. I noticed that my hands and face were vibrating very rapidly, at a faster rate than when shivering from the cold. It felt pretty weird, but soon forgotten with my mind everywhere at once.<BR>
<BR>
My first words were a conscious effort. “The sound,” came to be very slow and gentle, directed at my sitter. “Now I must lay down,” were the next. I returned to my sitting spot and layed back on the grass, noticing the stars, able to see more of them now. It took a good minute to get comfortable enough to remain still. I meditated quietly and without movement, for another few minutes, until my other friend reestablished reality from his DMT-induced unconscious state. We spoke, but I forget what of. I asked him to join me in an Om chant, so we sat facing each other. I sent love and happiness throughout the universe, to everyone and everything. We chanted then breathed in silence; I was in such a calm state of existence. At that point, I noticed that most of the effects had left my body and mind. The peak lasted [what felt like] 10-15 minutes. Our hug lasted forever.<BR>
<BR>
I did not, at any point during my trip, become unconscious or leave this physical world, but was given insights into the next level of awareness, a previously unknown but vital addition to the entity I call self. I later described my experience as a preview for what the 4th dimension is capable of. It was definitely a beautiful and mind-blowing trip into the subconscious! Is it worth repeating? Absolutely!!<BR>
<BR>
NOTE: Fasted for the day, prior to tripping in the evening. Drank papaya with white grape and pineapple juice. Ate a few dried papaya chunks.<BR>
