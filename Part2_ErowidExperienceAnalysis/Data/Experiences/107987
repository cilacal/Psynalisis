I've never used any psychedelic before and only previously smoked cannibis, dropped MDMA and tried some painkillers. It was an extremely exciting night and I was really looking forward to trying 2C-B after we tested its purity. I was meeting up with some really amazing people that I love being with. An old buddy of mine from middle school and an amazing girl that I instantly connected with. We were all dropping 2C-B for the first time. We decided to attend EPIC 4.0 on a whim and all were super excited.<br/>
<br/>
T0:00 - Got inside the venue and found a nice spot where we could lean against the rail and have a great view. Everyone dropped around the same time. Everyone also took some tums because other users have reported hard come up. Also would like to add that my last meal was around 6 hours ago and I had drank a medium coffee 1.5 hours ago. <br/>
<br/>
T0:15 - Starting to get hit with something. Definitely starting to feel the nausea. Got some water and beers to try and help with the come up.<br/>
<br/>
T0:30 - Starting to feel my body loading from my feet up. Feels very familiar as if someone is hugging my feet. The hugging feels like caressing and it was slowly moving up my entire body. Feels very nice and relaxing. Nausea also hitting stronger and coming in waves. Sinuses are getting runny.<br/>
<br/>
T0:45 - Full body load. My entire body feels as if its being hugged by someone I love dearly. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">My entire body feels as if its being hugged by someone I love dearly.</div></div> Feels amazing and I feel completely happy with myself. Breathing feels amazing. Feels very roll like as if I just dropped MDMA but it's so different that I can't explain. No visuals yet.<br/>
<br/>
T1:00 - I think I'm fully up at this point and everything just feels amazing. Its different from MDMA as the love I felt was mostly self love. I felt completely content with myself and felt as if I was in heaven.  I had some visuals appear color changing and lights were leaving a trail but that only lasted for about 5 minutes.<br/>
<br/>
T2:00 - Main event starts and I feel even better and everything intensified. The music and visuals for the concert was absolutely amazing. Lights felt amazing on my eyes similarly to MDMA and my body was still tingling and felt a gentle presence wrapping around my body. It was absolutely beautiful.<br/>
<br/>
T2:30 - 4:00 - Hypnotized by the show, music, and visuals. Everything was amazing and I felt as if I was in heaven. Sweating non stop even though we weren't moving. I didn't have a care in the world and I was just focusing on loving and enjoying myself. I could feel my soul every time I took a breath. Words can't even describe how I was feeling. No visuals at all. Full body high. Everything was below the neck.<br/>
<br/>
T4:00 - 5:00 - Got back to the car and talked about our amazing experience together. Was coming down but still felt amazing and content with myself. Listened to more music and vaped some cannabis. Synergies were really good. Everyone had a different experience and we talked, shared, and enjoyed each others company.<br/>
<br/>
T5:00 and on - Started to feel relaxed and sleepy. Feel really really happy with myself. Had a chocolate and didn't taste like dirt as it would've on MDMA. <br/>
<br/>
Next morning: Slept like 9 hours and slept really really good. Still felt amazing and remembering the night before made me extremely content. A bit sad that it was over but that's how I usually get after events. Felt very sleepy but that could he because I only had 2 hours of sleep the night before.<br/>
<br/>
Overall I had an absolutely unforgettable experience.  The entire night was perfect for me. Amazing company, amazing music and amazing experience.  The experience was very MDMA like but completely different feeling. The experience was all about self love and feeling content with yourself rather than sharing it on M. Euphoria was so much more intense and the ride was extremely smooth. Didn't have any hangover but only felt exhausted. Definitely will try this again but increased dosage for visuals. Probably won't drink coffee before as it probably made me sweat harder. Never felt anything like this before. Makes me realize that <br/>
<br/>
Life<br/>
is <br/>
so <br/>
amazing.<!-- End Body -->
