<!-- Start Body -->
I tried this two nights in a row and it was a repeated and varied experience every time.<br>
<br>
First night, the time was about 6:30 PM, I loaded a bong and ripped it all in one hit, I held it in for roughly 45 seconds and then blew it out. It hit instantly, I was pretty high before I even exhaled. I laid down in bed and put on Wonderland Dubstep Mix by mad Alice. I laid down and thought, 'wow I am really high' and closed my eyes. I started seeing visuals, mainly pulses and waves in tune with the music, I had a super body high. I listened to all the ambient noise and remarked how often we pass it off as white noise in daily life. That's roughly where things got trippy and bad.<br>
<br>
The only way I can describe what I felt is as follows. My mind and body sank into my bed and I lost the feeling of my body. I could not bring words to the thoughts in my head so they became a basis of pure emotional reaction. Basically my mind became a torrent of emotion and it was not a pleasant feeling. Every emotion was amplified 100x and it was all reactions like in a computer where, I experienced every mix of every emotion all at the same time, and the reaction to the different emotional mixes became their own entities, and then my emotions mixed with those reactions and made more and more entities of emotional reactions and they were blurring together and thousands of thoughts(feelings) flew through my head at 1000 times a second. Being dissociated from my body my basis for a 'self' was being thrown and hurtled through these reactions and calculations and I was being flung through consciousness in a very disorienting and unpleasant way.<br>
<br>
Eventually after what felt like hours this subsided and I was able to form concsious thoughts and immediately I thought, 'I am way to fucked up.' so I put in eye drops and stashed the rest of the JWH I had. I sat down next to my phone which was still playing music and I was barely capable of physical movement and I picked up my phone realizing the music was far too loud and it was making me feel nauseous. The same song was on and it was almost over, so I turned it off and laid down and shut my eyes. I woke up sober about 25 minutes later.<br>
<br>
Trial 2:<br>
<br>
Later that night before I took a shower I loaded up a bong and smoked it, I held it in for about 30 seconds and then exhaled. This time I turned on some music I thought was a bit calmer hoping for better results. I listened to Crystalize by lindsey stirling and then stood in the shower rapidly becoming very high again. Initially I was afraid I was going to become too high again and have a bad trip but I simply became entranced with the music and the beauty of it. I got lost in thought focusing on the music and I felt myself become one entity fused with the music and I was reminded of the cold setting of the music video and pondered why I was so warm before remembering I was in the shower. <br>
<br>
I started having auditory hallucinations thinking people were beating on the door and yelling at me. I felt like everyone in my house knew I was high and were very angry. Eventually I got over this and I sat down for the remainder of the high which lasted about another 20 minutes. When I got out of the shower still slightly buzzed for the JWH I looked in the mirror to see how obvious it was that I was high and I remarked that I looked like a really chill pirate, but not at all stoned and was satisfied before I went to my room.<br>
<br>
Trial 3:<br>
<br>
I wanted to watch a movie or cartoons on the JWH to see how it would affect me and the movies. I loaded some into a cigar tip and smoked it all in about 2 hits, holding in each for about 30 seconds. It became difficult to walk and I stumbled to my bed and collapsed. I stared at my computer and I began fighting with my subconscious which had become an external entity and I was mentally yelling at it to pick a movie because I was far to stoned to move my hand and hit the mouse button to pick one. I remember hitting my laptop attempting to select a movie but one never came. Eventually I just laid my head down and stared at the lank computer screen before again succumbing to my emotional torrents and mindlessness. After some time I was still locked into this phase but I retained my internal verbal abilities so I started arguing with my self conscious and telling it I was an idiot. Later I remarked to myself that I was on SSRIs and Buproprion and that a mix of any chemical that releases serotonin such as JWH is a terrible idea and that I could very well die there tonight. I didn't, sadly.<br>
<br>
Trial 4:<br>
<br>
The next morning I was alone and I decided that fuck my self conscious I'm gonna lose my mind today. So I loaded a bunch into a blunt. It was about 5 hits and I held them all in as long as I could. I don't remember much of the last two hits as I was already incredibly high. I remember attempting to make it back to my bed from the window and then I blacked out. When I came to I was still very much under the influence and someone was standing next to me screaming at me. I looked into their face and thought that I should recognize this person and realized they were yelling things at me but they looked totally foreign and were making no noise. My brain had locked out external noise and was instead producing its own noise and it sounded like an incredibly loud roar. I didn't know what was going on and I couldn't see straight. I sank into my emotional torrent and blacked out again. <br>
<br>
When I came to someone was holding my eyelids open screaming at me to stay with them and keep my eyes open. I looked down and noticed that about 6 people I didnt know were stretching me out and I felt like I was a mile long. Then immediately I realized I was curled into a ball very tight and was shaking radically and frantically. So I tried to relax and felt myself become stretched out again and blacked out again. I came to as someone picked me up and stuck me in a wheel chair, and then blacked out become again waking up on a stretcher in an ambulance. Someone yelled that I was still with them and then I realized that the people around me were paramedics. They started shouting questions at me and I had no clue what the words they were saying meant. I had lost the ability to understand language. I looked down and relized I had IVs in me and was hooked up to a bunch of monitors. Someone stuck a needle in me and I blacked out again. I woke up in the ambulance still and herd the words 'need more Valium' before blacking out again. I woke up 6 hours later in a hospital and had had a seizure that lasted almost 30 minutes and the paramedics had to take me to the hospital, I almost had to be air flighted.<br>
<br>
All in all, honestly I would totally recommend JWH, I like getting fucked up and I simply went too far. JWH is very fucking strong. Be careful have fun.<!-- End Body -->
