I made a cold water extraction of syrian rue by grinding up the seeds in a coffee grinder and then placing all the powder and seed shells in a coffee filter.  I then took the coffee filter and twisted and tied it shut.  I placed the filter in a small glass mason jar and put in 1 cup of distilled water and 1.5 teaspoons of white vinegar.  I shook it for  a few moments and placed it in the fridge over night.   Then I took the mimosa hostilis root bark and shredded it in my coffee grinder and placed it in a large steel pot with 2 liters of distilled water, and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.  I brewed this on a very light simmer (very few bubbles, but agitated water) until the water was reduced to about 2 cups. I poured this out into a steel bowl and through a t-shirt filter. I recollected the root bark form the t-shirt and put it back in the pot and repeated with another run of 2 liters of water and 1 tablespoon of white vinegar.  Brewed it down, poured it into my collecting pot through the t-shirt and did the process one more time.  Finally, after three brewings, I took the collecting pot and put its contents back into the brewing pot, but first I removed the rootbark and put it into a separate container.  I added about 3 liters of water to the pot and turned the burner on high.  I boiled the three brewings all the way down to about 2 cups of liquid and added another liter of water and boiled it down again.  This boiling process is to remove the vinegar.  After I had 1.5 cups of liquid I poured this contents into a small jar and placed in my fridge overnight. <br/>
<br/>
The next morning I took both jars out and heated them up slightly.  I drank the syrian rue down first in a slow method that took about 15mins.  I waited until I was slightly high and feeling the rue (about 20mins) and then I began to drink the mimosa brew.  I sipped the mimosa brew slowly for about 30 mins, and also sipped some fresh ginger tea that I had made by chopping up ginger and boiling it.  <br/>
<br/>
Approx. an hour after finishing my brew I was treated to a wonderful and dazzling light show much akin to a strong mushroom/acid trip, however this was much more powerful.  In fact it was so physical that I began to get really hot so I decided to leave the little meditation mat that I had made for this dream.   I went outside and it was a gorgeous San Francisco bay area evening.  Not too cold, but invigorating with a quiet breeze, and a slight misting rain.  I sat underneath an eve so that my head and upper body remained dry and my legs were being misted on.  The setting was pretty phenomenal.     <br/>
<br/>
The visuals picked up to a very high degree acid trip, but instead of being just visual it was also very physical.  I could feel the colors as they twisted and rotated and created new patterns.  It was a very intense feeling.  This went on for about 20 mins or so.  The patterns got very powerful so I decided to test out the closed eye visuals.  How remarkable! The light was brilliant to say the least.  It was like my own personal Pink Floyd Laser light show! and I had front row seats............the intensity in my head picked up and then out of no where came the purge.  <br/>
<br/>
There are many things to say of the purge, but to keep it brief It was sudden and very strong.  I was sitting there enjoying a nice closed eye visual journey and decided to lay down.  I guess this twisting envoked the purge because not too seconds after I moved I had my bowl in hand and was releasing.  It was quite the feeling to be purging and to have the intense closed eye visual and physical stimulation that I was having.  There were all sorts of brilliant colors and many buddha/buddhist symbols.  If I were more religious, I would relate the pruging to a very religious experience.  But for now I will say that it was enjoyable in many different levels.  After the purging my light shows, and dreams were incredibly reduced.  I would say I had some slight dreams for the next half hour or so and then it was back to a very moderate mushroom trip.  That remained for another thirty or so minutes and then I was pretty much back to a normal state.<br/>
<br/>
All in all, this was a pretty awesome experience and I do plan on doing it again.   <br/>
<br/>
Some things I will alter in my recipe:<br/>
I will reduce the quantities of my mimosa down considerably.  I had about 1.5 cups of tea to drink.  And while this was not the most difficult thing to palette, I believe it made for a longer absorption rate for my body.  SO by the time I had purged about an hour after consumption there was still a considerable amount of brew in my belly.   Also, I think I am going to get the mimosa from a more reputable source that is known to be stronger.  and finally I think I am going to do a cold water brewing on it. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks all for following, and enjoy.<!-- End Body -->
