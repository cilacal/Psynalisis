First of all M-CAT should not be taken lightly. In these next few paragraphs I'm going to tell you my first, while I'm still feeling the effects so spelling may be a lil screwed up or grammar, but who really gives a F****? NOT mwaaah! But secondly, make sure if your taking it your first time make sure you have a scale so you don't start out with the wrong amount or it will be overwhelming. Third, remember to breath in and out or you will lose track & catch yourself holding your breath. Fourthly idk if that's a real word (Fourthly) try keeping your body temperature down or you will feel like you have a fever & this can also be overwhelming! BUT here's my first MCAT/mephedrone experience while I'm lightweight coming down from it. <br>
<br>
Alright, I came into contact with Mephedrone/MCAT from a reliable source over the internet, my parents don't know I've been into this kind of stuff, but all is well because I'm just testing the waters ;). And yes I do live with my parents, so I had to be very discreet with it. So I ordered approximately 7 grams off this dude & it arrived this morning. I was so happy to have it but my parents were home & I had to hide it. I have a very few sorted amounts of hiding spots around the house but I decided to go & act like I was going to the bathroom to take a nice hot shower. I opened the bag and it had no smell to it at all, but I decided to put my finger in it and taste a few crystals, it had a salty weird taste but I guess that means its good quality stuff. I pulled my ID out of my pocket and started crushing up a pinch I had taken out, this was not a good idea, like I said you should take the right amount for your first time NEVER OVER-DO it, but me being me, crushed up what looked to be 600mg aproximately. (Was too exited. P.S. don't do what I do.) I have no tolerance at all to mephedrone or mdma, cocaine, etc. So I had the large line of Mcat & spread it into two even lines, 100mg would be decent for a first timer, but like I said I was anxious and thought it wasn't as bad as ppl have been talking about but I decided to break a pen in pieces to create a straw to snort a line before & a line after I got out of the shower to not make it look obvious ya know? Sooo<br>
<br>
 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span>  <br>
<br>
I've gotten a lot of info on Mephedrone and how it burns like hell so I thought to myself 'how bad can it be'. So I snorted the first line and it burned like Hell!!! My eyes got immediately blood-shot red and couldn't open my eye for like 1 min until the burn wore off. I sat there for a couple minutes and thought to myself what a load of bullshit I'm not high/don't feel anything at all! *got undressed hopped in shower* but halfway through my shower I felt all hot & slightly different, not mdma, but a different type euphoria coming on maybe even stronger...sike idk...but maybe sooooo<br>
<br>
T:0:10<br>
I got all dressed but kept the shower running because my dad was in the other room cooking breakfast. I snorted the second line and my other nostril and the other side of my face went numb. Waited a few minutes and it wore off & BAMM!! I was f****! It all hit me at once and I was trippin balls. Not only did I take to much, it was my first time & didn't know what the feeling was like at all. I sorta blacked out for a min but began to gain control & snap out of this trance I was in!<br>
<br>
T:0:20<br>
I began to 'roll' so hard I thought I was gonna die for a minute. I kept holding my breath & forgetting to breath but when the side effects wore off it was the best feeling I've had in a long time. My heart started pounding so hard & I started to sweat really bad. I mean not only was it a body high, I started have minor hallucinations and I had the sudden urge to brush my teeth because the taste was awful. Not only was this the biggest fail of my life but I was laughing hysterically when I noticed I was putting tooth-paste on the hair-brush I use VERY OFTEN. After throwing the brush away & making a huge mess with the toothpaste I finally managed to actually grab the toothbrush & stroke away. I began to clean up. I noticed I was shaking uncontrollably but EVERYTHING felt good & I couldn't just focus on one thing. Sorta like you get the jittery feeling?<br>
<br>
T:0:30<br>
Now I have been in the bathroom for 30 min but it felt longer. But I began to get paranoid because I knew my dad was in the other room. I opened the door and managed to get to my room which is just around the corner of the bathroom. I sat on my bed and it was getting stronger and stronger by the minute. I just had a feeling I haven't reached the peak! I turned around and noticed my reflection in the mirror in my room was moving while I was just sitting down, I tried not to look but began to realize it was asking me to come here, so I got up and wobbled to the mirror (it felt like my legs were warm and wobbly). That's the closest I can put it. As I got closer to the mirror I began to ask myself this was amazing & for this cheap!? Holy shit - outloud. That's when I noticed my dad standing right outside the door. He asks 'What are you up to? Breakfast is ready.' It's so much harder to think on a high dosage of meph. So I responded 'nothing just talking to myself as usual.' He's a pretty cool guy but he's not dumb but surprisingly bought it & closed my door. I began to sweat even more but I was able to gain control of my mind/body. Everything seemed to be going smoothly...I WISH.<br>
<br>
T:0:50 <br>
I'm still tripping but not as bad as before. When I was walked out of my room I noticed 4 10-mg Valium that must have fell out of a pocket, so I grabbed them, walked out of the room, grabbed a shot-glass filled it with a little bit of water and took all 4. Not hesitating with the Valiums, my mind went straight back to the Mcat. I thought it would last longer depending on what I read about it but the body high was intensively amazing. I really liked this stuff & didn't want it to end but snorting it destroyed my nasal passages before so I recalled reading about some people put it in water & drinking it or mixing it with anything and by doing this the high is less intense but lasts longer, so I gave it a try.<br>
<br>
T:1:00<br>
I pulled the capsule I had concealed in my pocket out and I eyeballed it, looked sorta like my first 600mg dose so far but I didn't want to take a risk and end up in the hospital, so I took half back and put the MCAT into the shot glass, along with a little water and down it went! Wasn't that bad just tasted like saltwater with a little mysterious flavor in it. I began to feel way different then I did at first, a more intense body high. At this moment I remembered my dad saying breakfast was ready, turned around and there was a full plate of delicious food sitting right in front of me! But...NO APPETITE so I put the plate of amazing food in the microwave so I could save it for later.<br>
<br>
T:1:10 <br>
I get a jolly rancher to out of the candy jar we have and it immediately took the nasty salt taste out of my mouth. I walked around a little and begin to feel light as a feather! As if I could fly! Also I started dancing to some Rock & Roll my dad was BUMPIN (listening too) in the other room. This dancing felt so uncontrollable and it suddenly felt like my body was going numb. But a good numb.<br>
<br>
Valium kicks in.<br>
<br>
T:1:25<br>
Everything began to go slow motion the music was still going in and out of my ears and I felt really NICE! My mom walked into the room and asked me why my eyes looked like that, I said,'like what'? She said 'your pupils are completely dilated & your eyes are wide open, are you high?' I responded, 'D0ooo0• ThEeeeY•Reaaally?' Talking in uncontrollable complete slomo, I knew my mom was onto something so thinking extremely fast I said 'let me go see for myself', controlling my speech this time. Quickly I walked into my room, grabbed some Visine to help my eyes out a lil bit. I noticed it really helped but I just looked exhausted. I went back to my mom & asked 'what are you talking about, my eyes are normal & I did just get out of the shower.' It seemed to help but I thought too soon, she looked at me and asked, 'why you sweating so bad?' Quick as possible I responded, 'did you not notice its hot as balls in here?' This must have worked perfect because she finally got me off her mind and said, 'YEAH WHO TURNED UP THE HEAT.' I responded, 'dad probably, you know I don't touch that sh**!'<br>
<br>
----RELIEF<br>
<br>
T:2:00<br>
I sat down and decided with the mixture of the Valium with the meph wasn't such a bad idea, I did feel relaxed & just good, like all my problems were lifted for awhile. If only the world right now knew what I felt like then it would be incredible & a considerably good amount still, but smaller amounts next time, keep it cool...<br>
<br>
All Opinions<br>
<br>
Positives:<br>
Cheap Alternative to Other Drugs<br>
Euphoria is Nice & Intense<br>
Makes You Relax<br>
Talkative<br>
Social<br>
Happy<br>
<br>
Negatives:<br>
Overwhelming At First!<br>
Illegal In Most Places<br>
Underestimated<br>
(Sometimes) Lost<br>
Chemical (Bad For Health) but maybe not<br>
Lasts short Periods<br>
Addiction is Very Possible<br>
Burn like Hell When you snort **WARNING**<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
<br>
Please please please read read read into this product before doing it. DON'T UNDERESTIMATE IT & depending on body weight I REALLY consider finding out or asking around or at least don't be dumb & jump into it like I did! Get a scale or something to measure out a desired amount every time. Today was my first time taking it. I don't feel like I could ever be addicted but I could see someone loving this stuff. Stick to Mary Jane if you have too. I think everyone should have & experience 'rolling' around their parents trying not to get caught...NOT.<br>
<br>
Thank You for Reading :)<br>
<br>
PS: I still feel amazing & relaxed....<!-- End Body -->
