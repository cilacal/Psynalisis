Well it has taken me a while to get around to writing this report, mainly because of the large amount of academic work required to complete my OAC year in High School. (That's grade 13 to you non-canadians). I meant to submit my piece as I am among the priveleged few who have had the luxury of experiencing IT-290, or AMT.<BR>
<BR>
I was informed of our aquisition of IT-290 by a very excitied phone call from my buddy S. That night we set about weighing the chemical into 25mg doses. However our scale was inaccurate and could only give us .05 g increments. So we were forced to make the doses 50mg each.<BR>
<BR>
My first thought upon seeing 1 g of AMT on the table was, roughly.<BR>
<BR>
'This stuff smells like cow shit!!'<BR>
<BR>
Well after a few weeks of experiencing low doses we found a party to experience the chemical at full strength. We ingested the chemical by cracking the gelcaps into a shot of orange juice and shooting the juice. (the gelcaps we had were much to big to swallow without risking choking ourselves, they only acted as storage)<BR>
<BR>
The owner of the cottage we were at expressed interest so we kindly cracked a third cap at no charge. He took a little over half of the contents. Since it was his first time, S and I ingested the rest.<BR>
<BR>
I estimate my dose at roughly 60mg.<BR>
<BR>
There were about 8 people at the cottage, all very close friends. There was no hostility between anyone, which made a very pleasant tripping environment for myself, S, and L (the owner).<BR>
<BR>
(T = 1 hr) Same as before, I notice an increase in energy and the edges of objects lose their sharpness (for tech heads like myself I call it hardware anti-aliasing) S and I are left alone while the rest of the party goes to get Pizza. L's girlfriend calls, and we have a friendly chat for 45 minutes while L is gone. Upon the return of the group, everyone cracks a beer (except S, L, and myself who have a 5 gallon jug of water instead) At this point we are all trippping heavily, and everyone is having a good time.<BR>
<BR>
AMT gives me good closed eye visuals, no auditory distortion whatsoever, all flat surfaces seem like a liquid, rippling and waving. Also open eye hallucinations are present, they manifest themselves as classicly pyschedelic in color and are essentially just random shapes melting and forming together.<BR>
<BR>
At this point (T = 4 hrs <peak>) two unexpected arrivals show up at the party. Both are good friends of our group, they both have large amounts of marijuana, and decide to roll a 'big bat'.<BR>
<BR>
They roll up a roughly 1/2 oz. joint (this was verified after the party it wasn't a change in perception caused by AMT), and we enter the bathroom to smoke it in a hotbox. 4 people in our group to not smoke marijuana, S being one of them.<BR>
<BR>
After the hotbox my night becomes unrememberable, it was an awesome experience to be sure. L and I discuss in detail what exactly makes a glowstick glow and a few more philisophical points in his kitchen. Needless to say about 2 hrs after we smoked the joint all but S retired to bed, he was still too strung to sleep. L and I slept quite soundly. AMT makes interesting dreams as well, and the experience of waking up in a full trip is an exciting one.<BR>
<BR>
A would rate my experience with AMT as one of the best I've had, I'd say its like MDMA and LSD at the same time, assuming MDMA and LSD had no synergy whatsoever.<BR>
<BR>
Coming up was comfortable, the drug eases you into the trip instead of the forceful acceleration of Mushrooms.<BR>
<BR>
I wouldn't recommend this Chemical to just anyone. You must educate yourself or at least have someone who knows much about the drug with you when you trip. DO NOT take this drug if you have frequent bad trips with other chemicals. Although this chemical gives you a significant E like experience, i've seen it work in exactly the opposite direction if you are not first emotionally stable.<BR>
<BR>
Overall I'd rate it A+ as an experience. A as a drug, but would recommend you school yourself with other physchedelics like Mushrooms and LSD, also try MDMA first as you will then be comfortable withwhat i feel are the full range of effects attributed to the drug.<BR>
<BR>
So have fun doing whatever you do, but be safe about it eh?<!-- End Body -->
