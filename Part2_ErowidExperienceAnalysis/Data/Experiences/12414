Me and my friend mike are walking around this celtic festival bored and looking to get fucked up after having no luck finding weed someone tells us that this guy has some 2ct-7 we never heard of it before but desided to get some. He said we could buy some if we could find a measuring cup because it was in water and the dose needed to be exact we got some spoons and took 10mg a little extra spilled in maybe a few mg it tasted wierd.<BR>
<BR>
Forty minutes later everything got all funny this dude was telling jokes and me and mike couldn't stop laughing this must be the drug taking effect.<BR>
Within the next twenty minutes the buzz started really kicking in <BR>
me and mike thought that we could push this pool table with our minds it seemed to sink into the floor.After about an hour of steady fairly mild buzz the visuals started patterns formed 'this is like chemical mushrooms' I thought but the buzz was still really mild and clear headed. Im now starting to trip everything is interesting and buetiful me and my friend find this bush which seemed to be made of jelly we sit in the middle of the bush and feel the lifeforce of the plant the leaves are covered in rainbows <BR>
<BR>
when we leave the bush we describe the same expirience. We leave the festival to go back to the camp site by the time we get there I am getting more and more fucked up while my friend say he dosn't really feel it.At this piont almost nine hours from the dose I peak<BR>
<BR>
I wander in to the woods and sit down I am overcome with a feel of bliss and joy I can sense the lifeforce of everything around me I try to talk but im dumbfounded by the incredible presence above me I look up to see the treetops melt together I look down to see waves rolling toward me across the ground.Me and mike sit there for an unkown amount of time then we look at eachother and say 'holy shit did you feel that!'  we went to the car to listen to music<BR>
<BR>
then i started getting a bit agitated because my friend kept turning into a skeleton it was scary but beutiful. Mike went to sleep but I couldn't becuase when I closed my eyes I would see mad pictures which i couldn't turn off I stared at them for hours and when i opened my eyes it was dawn and the clouds where celtic knots <BR>
<BR>
the visuals didn't stop till well into the next day. the next four days i felt somehow affected by my experience and could still see patterns out of the corners of my eyes I think I am ultra sensitive to this drug and will probably not take it again even though its one of the most amazing psychedelics I have ever tried and I had no nausea or body load at all.I just wish i could remember all the pictures I saw at the time I thought they where a gift from the bushes and the stars.<!-- End Body -->
