We received the 5-meo-dmt in the mail just a few days before moving out of the apartment. As soon as our gram came to the door, we headed out to collect supplies. We picked up a little glass tube from a gas station, the kind that those little wire-and-ribbon roses come in. We also picked up a package of coarse steel wool. After wadding up a pinkie-nail sized ball of steel wool and sliding it into one end of the glass pipe, and on the steel wool was placed a tiny knifetip of crystals. Holding the pipe horizontally, I lit the end and began inhaling slowly. As my lungs filled, I glanced at my friend sitting across the room from me. I then noticed that my senses were beginning to fade, and by the time I had set down the pipe and exhaled the hit, I had absolutely no reference to the reality I had just vanished from. It wasn't that I saw blackness- I simply didn't see. I didn't hear silence- instead, my brain seemed to simply ignore any information coming from the outside world. The trip surged in intensity over the next few minutes until I was entirely incapable of any form of linear thought. Any concept that entered my mind was tossed around for a moment without recognition and then discarded. I was simply NOT THERE. After a few more experiences I realized that the best method to handle the intense fear and panic I initially encountered (and the feeling like you're going to forget to breathe) is to simply concentrate on relaxing. Let yourself 'die' in your mind- and don't worry because your body will instinctively take over breathing after you 'forget'. Also, it's important to read LOTS of other experiences to be better prepared for the trip and to understand that long-term after effects are very rare- it will all be over in a few minutes. Relaxation and education are key to making this substance work for you.<BR>
