I tried Cocaine for the first time, and how the hell did I come to it?  <br/>
 <br/>
Most of my friends (or anyone who sees my perma-grin) know(s) that I thoroughly enjoy the sticky-icky; I could never turn down a nice smoke.  Weed is about the only drug that I've been 'consistent' with in terms of usage.  My interest in chemistry, especially that of psychoactives, has been so too, however I seem to go through 'phases' with other substances- these usually lasting about 2-3 months.    <br/>
  <br/>
I've had experiences with many substances: Good ol' Marijuana, mescaline, 'shrooms, DXM (plus other OTC meds), LSD, 2C's, Ether, Benzo's, Salvia, Opiates (Hydro -morphone -codone, Oxy -codone -contin), AMT, and many legal herbs.  <br/>
 <br/>
Cocaine has such a negative stigma attached to it.  That is such a generalized and naive statement, I understand, but allow me to elaborate:  Coke's given reputation really puts the substance on a high pedestal, making it infamous and an 'addiction waiting to happen'.  <br/>
  <br/>
Most people know that the sugar we use in our Tea, etc. was derived originally from a cane.  It goes through an industrial process that begins with the organic cane material and ends up with the granulated sugar.  Any similarities?  Believe me, I am not trying to minimize Cocaine or make a connection that I might have made when I was 10- but this is the part that bothers me.<br/>
  <br/>
I live in the type of city where one can't get away with much without it being the talk of the town, so most people are oblivious to what kind of things I 'dabble' in.  I'm no small town fella though, just the victim of social scene with nothing better to talk about.<br/>
 <br/>
Now to my first Coke experience:<br/>
<br/>
Friday night, a nearby storm creates an electricity in the air and beautiful flashes of lightning that made the sky purple and showcased the clouds in an ethereal way.<br/>
<br/>
The temperature was perfect (~65) with a nice breeze.  'A great night for tripping', I decided. So, at about 7:50 PM I took ~17 mg of 2C-I orally in a glass of cold water.  Unfortunately, at this point in my drug 'career' I consider that to be a small amount of 2C-I because oddly enough it was the first psychedelic that I tried.  My extreme use of this substance- (dosing around 30-50 mg in my 2c days) 700 mg in about 3 weeks resulted in a better understanding of my psychical self and a new respect for psychoactives.  For the following 8-9 weeks I had a depressing time in my life, perhaps due to the chemical itself or the radical perspective shifts that I had experienced. <br/>
<br/>
I received half of a gram of Cocaine from a friend,(T), as a gift.  It had no rocks and was completely a fine powder, with some sparkle to it.  It had a stronger scent than I had expected and to my surprise did not have a bad taste.  I was told that it was of good quality.<br/>
<br/>
I never saw myself doing Coke.  I had always been 'sketched' out by it or didn't even want to be near it.  In all honesty, I intended to give it to a friend,(C), who does it occasionally.  I gave (C) a call and we decided to meet up (~8:30). He said he had some coke of his own and was curious to see how mine was.  <br/>
<br/>
~9:30 PM<br/>
At this point, I'm doing pretty well on the 2C-I.  Nothing distracting or commanding, just a nice clarity and open-minded perspective that 2C-I seems to be so good at.  Also, I was noticing a few trails and with the storm, the warm night air was full of an invigorating energy.  I also was feeling slight facial tension especially below and around my jaw line, but that is nothing out of the ordinary with 2C-I and myself.  <br/>
<br/>
 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> .  I've seen people do some weird shit on the substance and though I have never lost control, being around someone who is thinking irrationally can really rub off, much less distract me.<br/>
<br/>
~10:00 PM<br/>
On the way to meet (C), I smoke a bowl of some sticky Sativa, which really kicks the 2C-I into the next level of visuals and also leaves me with a nice chilled out focus.  The synergy between 2C-I and weed is fantastic, so much so that I wouldn't dose without having a good little bit to smoke.<br/>
<br/>
I jump into (C)'s car and we roll around and catch up.  I then show him the baggie of Coke that I had gotten.  He opens it up, and after inspecting it for a few moments, asks if he could try some.  I give him the go ahead and he blows a nice sized 'cokespoonful'.  He immediately says that its 'real good stuff' and begins to compare his bag to mine, pointing out the differences in quality and telling me the identifying factors of good coke.<br/>
<br/>
~10:30 PM<br/>
Something happened. I just picked up the spoon, scooped some out (about the size of two match heads) and blew it.  I figured this was a good opportunity since it was decent coke and I was with good company.  So EASY to blow I couldn't believe it!  No drip, burning, or any discomfort (I once blew 40 mg of 2C-I, 20 in each nostril, and no words can describe how god awful the first 10 minutes are after snorting it- thanks to iodine and my dumbass).  The Coke seemed so smooth, and then I took some of the powder that had stuck to the inside of the bag and rubbed it on my gums.  Wanted to see what that was all about, I've heard so many embellished stories of what that feels like.  Just some numbness.<br/>
<br/>
So after a few more dots of mine, I'm feeling 'wow'.  I just start giggling and giggling, I wish that I could tell you that I saw something funny, nope, just me giggling like a 4th grader who's not supposed to be making a sound when the teacher's staring him down.  I was laughing as if I were the same kid who said 'screw it, I'm going to laugh anyway' and felt such a great release.<br/>
<br/>
I was surprised to notice that the energy from Coke is so much less than 2C-I, but much more of a broad, clear minded euphoria.  The energy was a lot more docile in that I felt a release in simple activities, like talking and dancing (later on in the night).  I was worried about the combination of Coke and 2C-I; worried that it was going to be too much energy.  Though, the two went well together, along with weed, to produce a chilled out euphoria.  Contrary to my suppositions, the Coke did not potentate the 2c-I experience for me, but rather changed the mood and nature of the trip (in positive ways).<br/>
<br/>
The comedown wasn't that bad and the 2c-I gave me enough perspective to help me keep tabs on my behavior and work through the cravings and the temptation to do coke all night.  I noticed the progression of having the feeling of wanting more coke this instant and 'who can we get more from?' to being content with the fact that I wasn't doing any more.  I found myself, about an hour and a half from my last bit of coke, perfectly fine with no cravings.<br/>
<br/>
In conclusion, the night turned out well, and I do not regret trying it.  All of the drugs: Marijuana, 2C-I, and Cocaine had a nice synergy for my workings.  At the end of the night, after being unable to fall asleep (~4:00 AM), I took 3.0 mg of Clonazepam and slept about 10 hours.  I woke up feeling groggy and a general malaise for the rest of the evening, which isn't unusual for me with the benzos- a drug that I only take as a last measure, and after all of the stimulants I had so eagerly taken; I found myself at that crossroad.<!-- End Body -->
