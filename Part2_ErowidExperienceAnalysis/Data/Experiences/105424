There’s honestly no point in attempting to describe the many events that have happened throughout my life which have led me to the point I’m at now, writing this experience report. So I will begin as most other experience reports tend to with a little bit of background information about me. I am a 21 year old male college student, relatively small at about 5’4” & 135 lbs. I began experimenting with marijuana by the age of 12, by 14 I was a regular pot user, & by 18 I had ingested every substance I could possibly get my hands on from oxycodone to LSD to ketamine to MDMA & basically everything in-between. I’d rather now skip over most of the pointless information and dive right into what I originally intended on posting.<br/>
	<br/>
This is a day in the life of an average substance abusing 21 year old; I just want to put this out there as a potential warning to everybody out there. I’m always functioning at a good rate, speaking coherently, and rarely miss responsibilities, so it would probably be a surprise for most to find out I’m almost constantly intoxicated. <br/>
<br/>
(6:20 am) I awake very early in the morning to get ready for my 8am work shift. As soon as I awake I pull a vape pen out of my pajama pants pre-loaded with a mixture of e-liquid heavily laced with 5F-AKB48 (a synthetic cannabinoid), and take several large hits and hold each in for several seconds. I can feel my temples begin to pulsate as soon as I exhale the vapors, my mouth dries up, my vision blurs, and I begin to become tired again.<br/>
<br/>
(6:30 am) After getting dressed I let my dog out to use the bathroom and the cold January weather begins to wake me up and vibrate my bones, I vape a few more hits to take my mind off the cold. About five minutes later I let my dog in and pour myself a small cup of 80 proof vodka (approximately 9 or 10 shots worth). I quickly down this back to back with some blackberry lemonade. <br/>
<br/>
(7:15 am) By this point I’ve gotten up, gotten dressed, let my dog out, fed her, and have thrown some coffee on the burner for work. I return to my bedroom and down about 6 more shots worth of vodka and take a few more large puffs off of my vape pen. After this I get my coffee and head off to work.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span><br/>
<br/>
(7:30 am) It’s funny because I almost always feel like I’m on the brink of being sober still (to the point where I’ll run back inside and down a few more shots sometimes before leaving the driveway) until I start to head down the road and that’s when the warm belly, sociability, giddiness, giggles, and all those other signs start to pop up. After driving about 5 minutes I pull into the local 7-11 to grab some breakfast, at this point I am still not noticeably drunk. No slurred speech, no stumbling, no smell, no eye glazing, etc.<br/>
<br/>
(8am-2pm) I arrive to my job as a laborer for a construction company, the current job is a demolition job which requires me to basically rip down walls, bag ‘em up, drag ‘em to a truck, and haul ‘em to the dump. A perfect environment to be hammered in in my opinion, I mean who loves busting shit up and acting reckless more than a drunk, right?! I usually fill up an empty half-pint glass with vodka to bring and sip on throughout the day at work too. I rarely get tired within working the first 5 or so hours at work, but when I eventually do start to tire I typically just go sit in the bathroom, take some really big hits of 5F-AKB48 and by the time I leave the restroom I no longer feel sore at all. I don’t know if the cannabinoids just have that well of pain relieving properties of if I’m just getting so damn stoned I don’t realize I’m sore anymore but it seems to work for me.<br/>
<br/>
(2pm-3pm) I return home and split a 10mg of oxycodone to take half of before walking my dog and getting a shower. After getting out of the shower I feel noticeably intoxicated (slightly blurred vision, slight stumbling, and the sensation that my mouth can’t keep up speaking at the rate that my minds thinking which leads to stuttering and garbled speech). I have a job interview to attend at 3:30 so I knock back another 2 shots and head out to my interview. On the way I also vape another good .2 or .3 ml of my liquid/AKB combination. <br/>
<br/>
(4pm) I return home from my interview and it went surprisingly well. I had no problems speaking, communicating, understanding the jobs requirements, and have a 2nd interview lined up in the next few days. I pop in the film “Secret Window”, make a salad and a hot dog, and sit down to watch. All throughout the film I hit my vape pen every 10 or 15 minutes which only now serves to give me a lightheaded, “hazy”, lightly stoned type feeling. About halfway through the film I drink a light beer and take about 5 more shots. At this point I’m starting to feel pretty fucked up, I stumble every time I stand too quickly, I am MUCH more sociable than usual, having conversations with my 13 year old cousin, and am in a very good, goofy, sociable mood (laughing, talking to people, exercising, dancing with my dog).<br/>
<br/>
(5:30 pm) I make another cup of coffee and head to my 6 pm class, I vape and listen to Modest Mouse songs, jamming and singing the whole way to school. <br/>
<br/>
(8:57 pm) I got out of class early tonight and decided to kill some time by writing my daily experiences with substance abuse because I’ve been meaning to do it for some time now.<br/>
	<br/>
I guess the main “moral” of my tale that I’m trying to get to is this; look, can I consume copious amounts of drugs and alcohol basically every single day, and still function and be “successful”? Yeah. Is it a good idea? No. Do I function well on a daily basis? Yes……Am I happy? No.<br/>
	<br/>
Partying and drugging will almost always start out being awesome, nothing but fun and games. But, before you know it, it can consume your entire life and soul. Be careful friends, moderation is key, don’t make the same mistakes I did.<!-- End Body -->
