It was New Years and I had to work the 'graveyard' shift at my job. I didn't really have any party plans since I was on Lock down for a DUI I had recieved earlier and my parents thought that making sure i wasn't able to party on New Years was punishable enough. <br>
<br>
A good friend of mine and a co-worker was desperate for some weed so he offered me a good trade. I had a half bag and wanted to try somthing new since I was going to have to be home bound all night. He said he would trade me three capsules of 2CT2 for a descent amount of weed. I accepted the offer and was excited about the night. I have never done ACID or any other hallucinagenic. I was told that 2CT2 was synthetic myscalin and  to be prepared for an experience. My friend followed mehome where I gave him the weed and he handed me the three capsules. <br>
<br>
I was going to snort them but was told that was a bad idea. So i broke the capsules and put the white powder in grape juice and gulped it down. My friend who gave me them had given me the last of the 50 he had. I asked if he could get anymore and was told that the 'factory' got busted by the DEA. Was I the last to experience these? Anyhow after taking them I took a shower, then settled for some T.V. That year Blink 182 did a shitty end of the year show. <br>
<br>
My stomach seemed to get a little upset till I had to almost run to the bathroom to puke. Right after puking I felt extremely dizzy like I was on a good amount of pills or somthing of that nature. After picking myself up the flowers on the bathroom wall seemed to morph into giant claws and comedown to grasp me. I walked back to my room and picked up the phone to call my friend when I heard this demonic voice spitting out some sort of gibberish. I threw the phone and didnt pick it up the rest of the night. <br>
<br>
I got the sensation that the walls were breathing and my Jerry Garcia poster looked like it was bubbling, like how hot water looks when it boils. The carpet along with my fan was swirling. Luckily i was enjoying every bit of it :). Later I got a call on my cell phone and some of my friends had to leave a party early because parents showed up unexpectidly. Being too drunk and high to go home they asked if they could stay at my house. <br>
<br>
I heard them outside and when I looked out my window a big green face shot out at me and went 'aaaahhhh' no biggie. I let them in where we smoked on my back porch (which really helped the drug kick in more.)To make along story short the night was intense at first but settled down into enjoyable visuals and a very comfortable body high. I would definetly do 2CT2 again, but everyone tells me that it is no longer available.<!-- End Body -->
