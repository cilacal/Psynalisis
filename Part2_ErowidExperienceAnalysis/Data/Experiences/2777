One Friday when my fiancée went to spend the night with her mother to do wedding crafts, I decided to use the time wisely. I usually don't trip around her except something comparatively weak like 5-MeO-DiPT that we can both enjoy in one way or another.<BR>
<BR>
When My .25 G arrived I had placed it in a very fine dropper bottle that was picked up a local science shop. A mere 20 ML which is broken down to 750 drops in the dropper bottle.  This means very accurate dosage.    Three drops = 1 MG.<BR>
<BR>
At 9:30 PM I ingested 20 Mg. Of  2C-T-7 on an empty stomach. The funny thing was that I felt a bit high before I even ingested it. I guess I was really ready for this and it was just anticipation. I had a very positive feeling and I guess I was bursting at the seams with it. I had read most of the trip reports and being experienced with other Phenethylamines and Tryptamines, I got busy putting the final touches in place. I had read one report where the author asked people to be careful, as some people are very sensitive to this chemical. I didn't think I would be one of them.<BR>
<BR>
9:47 PM   The first effect was just 17 minutes into it and it was a very mild trail. It seemed to be hitting me faster than most other people <BR>
<BR>
10:15 PM  I was in a very pleasant and dreamy mood. I was really getting up there. There was the sound of a couple in the alley having a disagreement.  I felt disinterested as I was in a very mellow mood. The open eye visuals were very pronounced now. Trails were very distinct and yet blurred at the same time. Huge auras were coming of the candles in different colours. I felt warmer than I should even though it was the end of July.  <BR>
<BR>
10:30 PM  By now, I now knew I was in for a rough night. I went to get something to drink. The Gatorade tasted more plastic than usual. I had the ' Oh No What have I done ' feeling that I have only had once before.<BR>
<BR>
10:37 PM  My fiancée called to say goodnight. I think I handled it OK but noticed that I was mumbling a bit. I slowed down and let her take the conversation.<BR>
<BR>
11:00 Approx. When the peak it came on very fast and within a few minutes I was in another world. I realized that this was going to be a somewhat spiritual trip. But there was also a disassociation. <BR>
<BR>
THE PEAK. There is no use giving you times here because time ceased to exist for me.  I went into the bedroom to lie down and was quite overcome by what was happening. I think I was a little shaky as I left the bedroom to go to urinate (in the bathroom I think). I went to the sunroom with my thoughts swirling as fast as the colours. I lay down on the sunroom floor and felt the cool night air wash and clean my body.<BR>
<BR>
I tried to meditate by was overcome by the trip. All I could do was to do deep breathing. At one point I found myself deep in prayer to the creator of the universe (I'm pagan but prayer is close enough) I was quite awed by the fact that there are so many people, each with a chance to improve themselves on the Karmic wheel. I found this experience to be a spiritual advantage. <BR>
<BR>
What I notice in retrospect is the difference between this and Psilocybin mushrooms, which I have a much closer affinity for. I was always ' me ' with mushrooms. The mushrooms gave me an insight in which I can improve myself even through all the alien landscapes and with complete ego loss, the quintessential me was always there no matter how strange things got or how ' out of body '  or ' dead ' I was.  With the 2C-T-7 there were periods where I did not exist. <BR>
<BR>
I think that at the proper dose that this could be a great sexual stimulant. Even though I was alone I could see where this could useful, though I would suggest a much lower dose.<BR>
<BR>
4:30 AM  I start to notice that the trip might be past the peak, but I'm still flying. The trails that I'm seeing are almost a parody of acid trails. I try to drink a glass of wine that I bought to help with the comedown. What a joke!!!  Even if it didn't stick in my throat I doubt that it would have helped.  <BR>
<BR>
5 ish  AM   I was really hungry all of a sudden. I usually don't eat when on Entheogens but I  decide to give it a shot. I was amazed by how good the food tasted. I was smart and didn't eat too much. But it gave me a bit of strength.  <BR>
<BR>
8:30 AM   I fell asleep for a few hours around this time but woke up for no reason. When I woke up what did see.  #^%&%&$ trails again.<BR>
<BR>
I went to the in-laws for supper that evening and I was ok if a little tired, but my soon to be father in law waves his arms sometimes when he talks, and I could see mild trails 22 hours after I first took my 20 MG pf 2CT7.<BR>
<BR>
Summary: <BR>
This is a very strong Psychedelic substance that is more comparable to Mescaline than anything else. Treat this with respect as if you don't you will pay a price.If you are thinking of trying this I have two pieces of advise.<BR>
1.	Measure the dose carefully as things can get out of hand even at low doses. Use the dropper measuring technique for dosing accuracy.<BR>
2.	Make sure you don't eat for at least 8 hours before ingestion. Longer is better. <BR>
<BR>
I will do 2C-T-7 again but at a much smaller dose. Maybe 5 to 8 MG and see where that takes me.  I found the after effect positive and that my 'soul' had renewed strength. I still prefer organic psychedelics but this was a positive event in a time where there will be many changes to my life soon.<!-- End Body -->
