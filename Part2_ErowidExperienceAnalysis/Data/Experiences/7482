It was about 8:30PM when I popped the capsule containing between 12-15mgs of Foxy. We were sitting in my friends basement with the blacklights on and some full on psychedelic beats. I was there with two friends, Z and W. Both of them had done some AMT about an hour earlier. <BR>
<BR>
For the first 45 mins to an hour, I felt nauseous. I've done Foxy before many many times and I don't usually get too nauseous. We smoked lots and lots of cannabis. As the night progressed, I had to get up several times to change CDs. At one point, I put a totally WILD album in and turned the volume up. It was: Hallucinogen - The Lone Deranger. <BR>
<BR>
As soon as the first track started, I realized that I wasn't just hearing the music through my ears, it was actually ringing in my head and I felt an akward sort of energy around me, being transformed by the music. I could see the depths of the sound waves in my mind and it was driving me wild!! The pictures are still so clear and I can still hear the 140 beats per minute in my head. I was on this wild journey until the CD finally finished and I had to get up again and change it.<BR>
<BR>
Overall, the trip was unlike anything I did before. It was great. I've done Foxy several times before and more hits of acid and ecstacy than I could ever hope to count, but I was totally unprepared for The Lone Deranger to take over my brain........<!-- End Body -->
