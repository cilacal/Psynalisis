<!-- End DoseChart  -->
<!-- Start Body -->
I am a 48 year old male, heavy build and using a high dose of lawfully prescribed morphine to deal with muscle and nerve damage to my back following an accident. I was looking for a possibly complementary pain killer along the lines of THC but without the legal worries. I am not a recreational drug user although I tried various things in my teens and have had some experiences of skunk.<br/>
<br/>
After some reading I found an online supplier of the substance 5F-AKB-48. This was marketed as a synthetic cannabinoid and came as a small sachet of plant material with the product sprayed onto it - it was packaged in a colourful foil envelope with some 'head shop' type designs.<br/>
<br/>
I rolled one cigarette, using a king size rolling paper. I used a small amount of tobacco and the equivalent of about two factory made cigarettes worth of the substance. It was evening, I was fairly relaxed, not worried or apprehensive, and I had eaten normally during the day. I was about two hours since my standard 100mg MST evening dose.<br/>
<br/>
I expected nothing to happen as I remember old smoking mixes when I was a teen (things like 'High Noon and Yuba Gold) that did absolutely nothing. I was very, very wrong about this.<br/>
<br/>
T00 - start to smoke<br/>
<br/>
T30 seconds - Very strong feeling of being high, in every way like strong cannabis<br/>
<br/>
T1minute - Sensation growing with every passing second - by this time I have had about four deep inhalations from the joint. Stop smoking as the feeling starts to over power me and I get a little scared. I make my way (just) up the stairs to bed.<br/>
<br/>
Time, at this point, becomes meaningless. </pullquote>Unbelievably I find myself in the midst of the most over-powering body high and start to trip</pullquote>, very heavily like old-fashioned LSD mixed with mushrooms. <br/>
<br/>
I won't go into the trip - it was insane but there are a million descriptions of those on the net - suffice to say it was immensely transcendental and un-earthly - and completely, desperately unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
After what seemed like an eternity trapped inside my own head - with complete loss of sight and all other senses replaced by screaming, Steve Vai like guitar sounds - I started to hear my wife's voice, trying to get through to me. Very slowly, I re-gained my vision and awareness to find my very worried wife sitting on the bed with me trying to get some responses. For the longest time I did not know who I was or who she was. The worst thing was an overriding sense of terror.<br/>
<br/>
Over the course of about 20 minutes I came round to be left with a similar feeling to having come down from mushrooms/cannabis. Apparently, at the worst stage, I was convulsing with my eyeballs rolled back into my head and but for this only lasting a couple of minutes my wife would have called the emergency services.<br/>
<br/>
I know this sounds over the top but I beg you to believe me - this substance should be approached with extreme caution (if at all) and whilst I may have had a bad reaction that is possibly atypical, it is a hard fact that this could happen to someone else. Using this and driving would be suicide/murder, using it whilst depressed or unwell could be similarly catastrophic, and if this is tempting any hard line psychonauts to experiment, think again - there was not one single second where the experience was anything less than terrifying. I have back pain but am otherwise in robust mental and physical health and this stuff nearly snuffed my mind out.<!-- End Body -->
