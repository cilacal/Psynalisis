<br>
Hey there readers! I'd like to tell you the story that changed the way I do..Me?<br>
Now first off, I would like to state, that I had been VERY stupid and please, please don't try to repeat this. I was on a drug I had never tried before, on a dose that I never in my life dreamed of taking and doing the things I did while under its amazing spell,  behind the wheel of a car. <br>
<br>
I was an idiot, twisted beyond anything I had ever imagined, let loose into the wilds of a downtown city sprawling with crowds of people. Life everywhere and people in abundance, while the same time, cool, calm, collected, well mannered, and tripping f***ing balls.<br>
<br>
My experience with drugs is above average, I recently turned 24, I'm a slim, short athletic 120lb man. At this point in my life I've smoked my fair share of good bud, done some MDMA, mushrooms a time or two, opiates here and there, an aderal once in a blue moon to brighten my day at work, and that about does it.<br>
<br>
So starts my story! I wake up, smell the coffee brewing, and set about my normal days doings. I wasn't working at the time of this event, so I had a lot of goofing off time to myself.  I had recently read up on 25I-Nbome, and was looking to try it, so I had ordered some from a very reliable source of mine, and proceeded to wait the argues two weeks for it to arrive in the mail. <br>
<br>
So to my amazement, the stuff arrived! Oh great joy said to myself. I couldn't wait to try it, I'd psyched myself to the point that I'd sooner than later forget that I had things to do this day, and didn't really understand how important of a day it was going to be.<br>
<br>
T-0:00: First dose; .25 mgs followed by another .25 mgs 15 minutes later. I began to notice myself off baseline at about 15-20 minutes after I had taken the initial and second dose. I was to excited for words at this point. The first time I would notice vivid visuals for the first time. My walls began to slightly breath, and my mood was very happy, and enhanced by the drug. I was beginning to have a great time until I received the information that would turn the entire paradigm of the trip in the opposing direction. <br>
<br>
T-0.50: My mother walks in the door, and says 'are you ready to go' I look at her oddly and ask where. 'To my doctors visit! YOU have to take me there! Now get your silly ass ready to go' <br>
<br>
I at the time, didn't really know how to take this, but for some reason, I had no fear of driving, in fact, I felt my ego rise up and I accepted the challenge full well knowing that I would not only be driving, but whacked out on a drug I've never done before?! I didn't understand this concept, and simply put, I brushed my shoulders of it and took the rest of the tab(1mg total), threw my shoes on, and off we go. <br>
<br>
T-1:20: We all hop in the car, and head downtown. A stones throw in the whole scheme of things, but none the less, a good 5 mile drive. Everything is going according to plan! My brain is very stimulated as the drive goes on, but no outlandish eye popping visuals yet. <br>
<br>
T-:1:40: We hit the hospital, walk in, and get seated. At this point, I'm noticing EVERYTHING is moving, the walls, the shitty carpet, peoples faces. Everything has this, glimmer to it, it was astounding, and then It starts.. The fear, and paranoia that comes with being in public eye, while eyes wide open. I quickly make it back to the car and in an effort to calm down, I smoke a cig and look out of the parking garage.<br>
<br>
T-2:00 I walk back in and it would appear that my mother had forgotten her insurance card, so I was asked to drive all the way back home to retrieve it. Not a simple task to be given to the twisted mind, but I accepted the challenge and went on my mary. Not before popping one more beautiful square blotter in my mouth tho! (now at 2mgs)<br>
<br>
I head the way of home, and enjoy the lovely music in my ear, and ride along as if nothing was wrong. The visuals were not really present, but the perception of depth had seriously been skewed. Driving slow looked as if I was in a bubble, driving fast(40 mph), was as if I was driving an F1 car through downtown. Everything looked as if I was looking at it in the small mirror on the right that states 'objects may be closer than they appear' so I kept my distance away from most of the cars going back home.<br>
<br>
T-:2:30: I make it to the house! Bursting at the seems with powerful, euphoric energy! I race to my mothers room, swiftly pick up her wallet, and proceed to my room, where I would have an encounter like no other. My first entity contact! The shadows from the fan on the ceiling formed a face, and the face was silently communicating words of wisdom it felt like to me.. Very glowing, and perked my mood even further!<br>
<br>
T-3:00 After spending a moment in my room, observing everything. I scoot my happy go lucky ass back to the hospital, the drive was divine, guided by a persistent afterglow and the kicking in of the second blotter. I arrive at the hospital, and hand off the wallet, and walk back to the car to check out the view.<br>
<br>
T-:3:20: Two majorly visual things happen. I look upon downtown and I see everything, the energy that flows through the buildings as they sway and morph into beautiful flowers, the sounds coming from the cars, and smell of fresh air coming through as a cool breeze whispers by. I was in awe of city's inner beauty. I decide to move the car to the other side of the garage to get another view, and to get closer to the entrance my mother and sister would soon be moving through. But just before that takes place, I look out, into the dark blue sky with clouds parting faster and faster while they morph into a complete war of the gods! I was awestruck, and I looked upon this view for a grand total of 1 minute. Yet there is an image burned into my memory of a pair of horns morphing in the clouds! A victor has risen!  By this moment, I'm yelled at, and snapped out of my trance like state, and zoom quickly to scoop them up and head home where I would sit comfortably in my bed and enjoy the mind blowing visuals.<br>
<br>
T-6:00: Its 6pm and I decide to take another hit, just for the lulz! I take said hit, and am soon blasted into another realm of existence, where everything and I do mean E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G Is moving! The dimples that are inset in my walls dance around like ants, the lines widen and form bleeding trails of straight black pigment. Looking over to my right reveals a fully 3d sphere made of 2d hexagon patterns, that swirl with vivid blues, and deep greens. <br>
<br>
T-??:?? I've lost concept of time, visuals are peaking, music in any form is beautiful, I am fully immersed in what feels like the matrix. Things on the wall begin to melt, and the slow gradual slip of sanity soon hits an eclipse of sorts, as my entire mindset grew dark. The only lights in this room, are the ones created by my own eyes. <br>
<br>
Things begin to get fuzzy from here on, I do know I slip my last blotter in my mouth and play with it endlessly until its nothing but a spit ball of sorts. My vision is fuzzy, and everything has an interesting texture to it. I sit there in my mind of which is cracked open like coconut. I fall into a trance once again, only this time, I don't snap out of it until I awake the next morning. <br>
<br>
I wake up, feeling OK. Not bad, not entirely good either. I load up some good music, fill my coffee cup, and go about my day, where I get interviewed at the place I now work for. I will say this much, that morning, walking to my interview, I could have sworn I wore rose colored specticals, tho I had no need for glasses. :)<br>
<br>
This was by far the best psychedelic experience I have ever had. Even with later experimentation with LSD, higher doses of mushrooms, and even a run in with DMT still hasn't topped this day, on this wonderful drug. But please, bare in mind, what I did under the powers of this drug was stupid, regardless of the tons of fun I may have had. I could have killed myself either from an extremely high dose of this new substance, or worse yet.. Ended the lives of my family perhaps including myself. Please, don't be an idiot like me. Don't embide and drive. Ever.<!-- End Body -->
