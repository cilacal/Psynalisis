It was one of those very strange weekends where I was going to pull an all nighter, so I decided to load up on caffeine. Coffee, Mountain Dew, Jolt, Surge, I was drinking whatever I could find.<BR>
<BR>
Anyway, the night went rather well, as I was bouncing off the walls. Over the next 24 hours, I phased in and out of sleep. At about seven o'clock that night, I went right to sleep. Everything's going okay, but wait, there's more.<BR>
<BR>
I woke up at about two in the morning. I got up, drank a glass of water, and went back the bed. The next moment stands as one of the strangest experiences of my life.<BR>
<BR>
I heard a strange, indescribable sound. It resonated, and echoed, growing louder every time. I knew it was coming from the inside, but I was still very afraid. When it soon seemed to get unbearably loud, it stopped. I got up. Or, at least I tried.<BR>
<BR>
For the next few seconds, couldn't move at all. Any commands I send to my arms and legs wouldn't work. Of course, I knew that I had sleep paralysis at that moment. <BR>
<BR>
I waited a few seconds and was able to move again. Some people have these experiences and think it was divine, or perhaps even interstellar.<BR>
<BR>
But I know that these strange effects were the result of caffeine.<BR>
<BR>
Please tell me I'm not the <i>only</i> one that hear's these noises. It happened again, and for the same reason. It started to scare me.<!-- End Body -->
