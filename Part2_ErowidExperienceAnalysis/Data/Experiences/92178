My previous experience with psychedelics includes lots of cannabis, a few low and very high dose mushroom trips, several Salvia trips, LSD once, 10mg trip on 2-cb and one ecstasy buzz.<br/>
<br/>
Cactus - San Pedro <br/>
Dose - 2 feet and about 10cm in diameter ~ 500-600mg?<br/>
Preparation - Whole cactus sliced then boiled and blended into a soup then boiled down to about 800mls<br/>
<br/>
I slept until about 11am then had a shower and grabbed all my supplies for the day (3L of water and some food). I had been fasting since the night before so I grabbed some food to eat after ingestion. I had also had some travel sickness pills the night before and in the morning.<br/>
<br/>
My plan was to ingest my horrid cactus juice then go back to my mate's place after he finished his exam. So at about 12 I started drinking my juice in a large local park, the taste was horridly bitter and foul but I chased it down with limes and orange juice which made it just bearable. This took about 45 minutes to do.<br/>
<br/>
At about 1 I was feeling very nauseous and felt like I was going to vomit so I decided to smoke some weed to soothe my stomach (which turned out to be a great idea). I then proceeded to lay down in an attempt to calm my stomach.<br/>
<br/>
About 20 minutes passed and I was feeling slightly different, I thought this was just the cannabis because cactus is supposed to take a long time to come up. My thoughts were wrong, at about 2 I decided to go for a walk and when I got up I realized that this is the mescaline kicking in. The concrete had Aztec patterns and temples dancing and my whole surrounding felt much more vibrant and impacting. Walking was difficult as I wanted to sit down and rest so I did along my way to my mate's school.<br/>
<br/>
At about 3 I had reached my destination (took me 1 hour to walk 500 meters). I waited near the gate for his school to be let out. I texted him and told him where I was but I got no reply so I called him all I got was voicemail, I decided to just wait it out and stayed at his school until about 3.30 all the time trying to get a hold of him with no luck.<br/>
<br/>
I was hungry so I walked about 3 km to a supermarket where I bought a pie and some bread. I then went to a large park with a pond and native bush (I am in New Zealand so that means like ferns and shrubs). Once here I started to really feel my self trip hard; the concrete was forming patterns which were amazing and complex (I found it very empowering to think that my mind was creating everything I saw in front of me). <br/>
I then looked up at the clouds and they were also forming shapes and tessellating like crazy. I felt like I was in control of the clouds and I was making them join and split with such precision and finesse it was hard to believe.<br/>
<br/>
At about 5 I decided that I would just go and make a camp in the bush (about 10 km away) instead of just turning up at my mates place. So I walked up some steep hills and grabbed some dry firewood on the way. The walk there was very strange, I had memories of being a child and a strange recollection of the events currently happening. I felt strong in my mind and body like I was going to provide for my self like some kind of caveman (sounds strange I know). I kept my confidence up by thinking about how I was going to provide for myself and make a fire.<br/>
<br/>
I reached my destination at about 8 and it was nearly pitch black, I walked down the track which lead through the bush and found a nice spot about 500 meters away from the trail to avoid suspicion. I set up a camp by getting some ferns and creating a small wind shelter (It was in winter). I began trying to start a fire but found it difficult because it was wet and was having difficulty concentrating. Once I had got a fire going I started to relax and warm up, I stared at the fire and saw Aztecs again but this time dancing around inside the flames (Very cool to look at) they were calming me down and it felt like I was not alone but instead was surrounded by a great inner and outer warmth, I felt at one with the earth around me.<br/>
<br/>
At about 9 I decided to cook some bread (toast?). This warmed me up and made me feel that maybe not finding my friend was actually a good thing because here I was roughing it in the bush under my own power. Strangely I wasn't scared of anything at this point, even thought I was in a pitch black bush on the outskirts of the city running out of dry firewood, I wasn't afraid of this because of all the self encouragement I had given myself earlier. <br/>
<br/>
At 10 I tried to sleep but was too cold and was still too buzzed from the cactus to calm my mind down to a sleep state. I tried meditating but was too cold to hold on to any calmness. At this point I needed to move to try and warm up as I had run out of dry firewood and all the bush around me was too green and wet. So I ran to try and stay alive (it was about 5*C and I only had 2 layers on). I was slightly scared at this point because up to here the cactus had given me confidence and courage but as my temperature dropped my mind was in a fury thinking about how I would have to fight to stay alive. I was having difficulty focusing on what I should and I knew if I didn't do something fast I would slip into a bad trip. <br/>
<br/>
At 11 I was still at serious risk of hypothermia but had a smart idea to stuff ferns down my shirt and start running to build up body temperature, I am unsure if it was the mescaline or survival instinct that gave me this idea but either way this really warmed me up and swayed my mind away from a bad trip.<br/>
<br/>
At 12 I was warm and still seeing pretty intense closed and open eye visuals mostly of a kaleidoscopic/Aztec style. I began the long walk back to my house as I decided I would not be able to sleep in the bush with a lack of proper clothing and dry firewood. During the 15 km walk home I did not feel tired or sore at all and every footstep still felt vibrant and soft. Street lights would leave trails and cars passing by would have trails like a long exposure film, I was amazed that I was still feeling such effects 12-14 hours on.<br/>
<br/>
I got home at about 4am but was still far off baseline. I layed in bed and stared at my ceiling for a good hour observing the Aztec dancing which has followed me the duration of my trip (almost like a trip guide).<br/>
<br/>
The day after I woke at 12 and still had a body buzz with my mind feeling like it was in a dream state, my feet and legs were sore from the 30 km trek the night before but I knew it was all worth it.<br/>
<br/>
From this experience I think I have gained some serious self confidence I now know that I am a strong person both mentally and physically and this in turn has improved even my love life, I had the confidence to chat to a chick who I thought was way out of my league before my trip and I turns out she had a thing for me the whole time. I would defiantly do mescaline again and am planning on doing an extraction in the coming weeks. To any people thinking of doing mescaline I would say to go for it but if possible do an extraction because of the taste.<!-- End Body -->
