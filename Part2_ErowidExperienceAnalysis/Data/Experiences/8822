Two friend and I each insufflated ~8.5 mg of 2C-T-7.  We chose to insufflate it as opposed to take it orally so as to decrease the length of the trip.  After 15 minutes, a very intense tripping feeling came on; I found it affected my thought patterns much less than LSD, but distorted vision and motor skills much more.  After about 30 minutes, we all began to feel sick to our stomachs.  During the next 2 hours, I threw up several times and felt miserably nauseous, while continuing to experience an incredibly intense trip.  My two friends also threw up; however, they seemed to recover physically much sooner than I did and were able to have a few crackers and water after an hour.  Throughout the 'sick' part of the evening, I kept thinking that I had taken a bit more than I should have (both because of the physical illness and the intensity of the psychadelic).  After the sickness finally went away, I was able to enjoy the next 8 hours with my friends.  We talked, snacked, watched a movie, and had a generally fun experience. From approximately 6 hours after insufflating, and for the remainder of the time I was up, I would describe the experience as very similar to the 'coming down' stage on LSD.  I would like to add that this:  a week before I did this, I had seen a friend do the same thing (snort T-7), and then proceed to flip out and think he had overdosed and tell me never to make the mistake of insufflating 2C-T-7.  I believed him... so why did I do it?  I was very curious just how intense the experience was.  I knew that the person who warned me was being honest, but what had disturbed him most was the amazingly fast onset time, and I wanted to know what that felt like.  So, although I would not encourage anyone to insufflate 2C-T-7 also, I do sympathize with those who chose to do it anyway.  If you are going to do it, please PLEASE be careful in weighing out the dosage accurately and be conservative with the dose size.<!-- End Body -->
