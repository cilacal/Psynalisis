On the last night of the year 2001, I decided to visit the house of my cousins, B and K, and K's friend C. My sister T came along as well. I had second thoughts about bringing her along, because she had recently adopted what I saw as a particularly preachy and ill-informed form of political activism, and was really beginning to rub me the wrong way.<BR>
<BR>
I had heard that K and C were planning to take some mushrooms that evening, so I decided to bring along some 2C-T-7 that I had been saving for some time. I'd taken this drug maybe four or five times  before, and some of my experiences had been difficult. I was vaguely aware that there might be rocky waters ahead, but this didn't really worry me at the time.<BR>
<BR>
When T and I arrived at the house at 10 PM, I took 15 milligrams of the drug in a distilled water solution. In my earlier experiments, I taken 10 to 12.5 mg. I had experienced some nausea before, so I was cautious about increasing the dose.<BR>
<BR>
The mood in the house seemed a little rowdy. B had some friends over, and they were already pretty drunk. Every once in a while, there would be some sort of fight or accident. A number of glass articles got smashed, and a lot of beer ended up on various people and the floor. After a while, I noticed that K and C had moved to a quieter room, so I went to join them.<BR>
<BR>
I had a sort of romantic interest in C, and was looking forward to spending time with her. I was fairly certain that this interest would never amount to anything, but enjoyed being around her none the less.<BR>
<BR>
I began to get a strange vibe from K and C. They are very close friends, and I felt that they didn't want me to be part of their conversation. It seemed as though they were part of some exclusive group that I could never join, and I was beginning to resent them for it. By this time, T had had several beers, and came in to the room to talk. I was getting really annoyed with her, and I think everyone else was as well. She seemed really obnoxious and insincere, and I was beginning to worry that people might resent me for bringing her along.<BR>
<BR>
K and C expressed interest in trying the 2C-T-7, so I poured them each a dose of 10 mg. I rarely find anyone who is willing to take it with me, so this seemed like a cool idea at the time. Around this time, I was beginning to feel the effects of the drug, and was pleased to find that my usual nausea and stomach lightness were absent.<BR>
<BR>
After a long period of indecision, we wound up at a dumpy karaoke bar across the street from the house. Sober, it was a strange place to be, but in my current state it was difficult to handle. The people who frequent the bar seem to be either hardcore alcoholics or trendy university students. A number of people struck me as being quite monstrous and frightening. K and C were having another private conversation, and I found myself with no-one to talk to. There was a rowdy drunk sitting behind me, and I had a niggling fear that he might wind up hurting me somehow.<BR>
<BR>
The regulars at the bar tended to choose old country songs to sing. Some of them were pretty good, although I'm not really a fan of that sort of music. Others seemed to project an aura of misery that I found quite disturbing. I imagined the sort of lives they might lead, and it really frightened me. Nobody else seemed to understand what I meant.<BR>
<BR>
Someone let out a scream that really frightened me. I was pretty sure that someone had badly hurt. I tried to explain this to C, but she misunderstood what I meant and seemed offended. The atmosphere seemed to get scarier and scarier. When I talked to my companions, they acted as though I was just being a jerk. When I tried to describe the freakish ugliness I saw, they would say something to the effect of 'They're all just people'. The scene reminded me of the Twilight Zone somehow. Maybe I am just a jerk, but I can't help what I saw.<BR>
<BR>
After the bar stopped serving beer, the service staff began to intimidate everyone into leaving. It seemed like they thought we really didn't belong there, and I thought the bouncer might hurt me somehow.<BR>
<BR>
When we got back to the house, K and C went into a room away from everyone again. Everyone else seemed to be sleeping, so I went to visit them there. They talked a lot about how they were hiding away from everyone, and this seemed to imply they didn't want me there either. I had managed somehow to further offend C with some offhand comment, and I was convinced that she was growing to hate me. I eventually left the room and spent the rest of the night in bed, experiencing some intense eyes-closed visuals, and brooding over the total failure of my imagined romantic conquest. I decided it didn't matter, because I was growing to dislike C myself. I left the house as soon as I woke up, after a hasty goodbye.<BR>
<BR>
The experience was difficult, but not entirely unpleasant. I think it helped me to come to the right decision concerning my feelings about C.<!-- End Body -->
