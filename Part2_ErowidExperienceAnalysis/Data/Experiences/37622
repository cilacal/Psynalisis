                    I visited centers of the Santo Daime with Jyoti, our guide 
                    from the Kayumari network, and ten other Westerners from Europe 
                    and the United States, on a three week tour. Our first stop 
                    was Brasilia, the <strong><a href="#01" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/brasilia.JPG','','width=660,height=500')">capital 
                    of Brazil</a></strong>, a <a href="#01" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/brasilia2.JPG','','width=660,height=500')"><strong>modernist 
                    city</strong></a> built from scratch in the early 1960s. We 
                    stayed at a Santo Daime community on the outskirts of the 
                    city, and attended two ceremonies while we were there. </p>
                  <p><img src="../images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="14" vspace="3">In<a name="02"></a>itially, 
                    I experienced a tremendous resistance to the Santo Daime work. 
                    In the shamanic ceremonies I had attended in the past, we 
                    took our medicine in the dark, and the focus was on experiencing 
                    individual visions. In the Santo Daime ceremonies, the lights 
                    were kept bright, and the energy was focused on creating a 
                    kind of group mind. Later, Jose Murilo and Fernando La Rocque, 
                    our <strong><a href="#02" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/jyoti.JPG','','width=660,height=500')">hosts</a></strong>, 
                    explained that they called it &#8220;collective shamanism.&#8221; 
                    It also took me a while to get used to the hymns, which seemed 
                    very foreign at first. I also felt a powerful negative reaction 
                    to the idea of a formal religious <strong><a href="#02" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/ceremony.JPG','','width=660,height=500')">structure</a></strong> 
                    where people wore uniforms, sat in rows, and separated men 
                    and women.</p>
                  <p><img src="../images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="14" vspace="3">I 
                    kept having to run out of the ceremony. I would leave to sit 
                    near the fire outside or to walk around and look at the stars. 
                    There were guardians assigned to keep watch over the ceremony 
                    and these guardians kept coming over to try to get me to go 
                    back inside. For me, at that point, it seemed to be a violation 
                    of my personal freedom to be part of the ceremony. I only 
                    returned with the greatest reluctance. I felt anger at their 
                    attempts to restrict my independence.</p>

                    with decorative streamers. For our one night there, they organized 
                    a ceremony that involved dancing all night. The dance was 
                    a little two-step, everyone shuffling back and forth within 
                    a little three-foot space. I danced for a while, then my resistance 
                    rose up again. I ran out to sit by the fire, then went back 
                    to my hammock. In this community, nobody seemed to care whether 
                    or not I stayed in my place. </p>
                  <p><img src="../images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="14" vspace="3">I 
                    returned alone to our guest quarters where I realized that 
                    I did want to participate in the ceremony. My resistance had 
                    suddenly disappeared. I went back and danced the rest of the 
                    night, and I began to understand why the Santo Daime ran the 
                    ceremonies in such a rigorous way: As I allowed myself to 
                    stay in &#8220;the current,&#8221; as they call it, I felt 
                    like the medicine was not only introducing me to a divine 
                    force or presence, but it was also flushing out my psyche. 
                    It was a bit like a Buddhist mindfulness meditation where 
                    thoughts would arise, then channel themselves out. </p>

                    next morning, I went back and sat for a while inside the empty 
                    church. For the first time in my life, I felt that I understood 
                    the nature of devotion as a spiritual practice. It seemed 
                    as if devotion was a vibration or a kind of frequency that 
                    helped to hold together the structure of reality. I felt moved, 
                    and grateful that I was being introduced to this ceremonial 
                    practice.</p>

                    with Padrinho Alfredo and Luis Fernando</strong></a> two and 
                    a half days down the Jurua River. We stopped briefly to visit 
                    the Daime center in <strong><a href="#04" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/ipixuna.JPG','','width=660,height=500')">Ipixuna</a></strong> 
                    and then traveled on to the village of Estorr&otilde;es, which 
                    is also known as C&eacute;u do Jurua. For some reason, I was 
                    sort of terrified of this trip before leaving New York, and 
                    I couldn&#8217;t even bring myself to look at a map to see 
                    our destination. All I knew was that we were going very deep 
                    into the Amazon. </p>

                    we climbed into <a href="#05" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/Hammock.JPG','','width=660,height=500')"><strong>hammocks</strong></a> 
                    strung throughout the boat. Mine was located on the top deck, 
                    under a small roof, and it was an incredible experience. At 
                    night I would wake up to find everything shrouded in fog, 
                    the trees just visible like wraiths on the banks. I felt like 
                    we were floating into the void, into the abyss, and it was 
                    utterly liberating.</p>

                    Finally<a name="06"></a> we reached our <strong><a href="#06" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/our2.JPG','','width=660,height=500')">docking 
                    spot</a></strong>. Part of our initiation process was learning 
                    how to make the Santo Daime sacrament (ayahuasca), to work 
                    with the two plants that are brewed together, the vine and 
                    the leaf. As soon as we landed, we were brought to the <a href="#06" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/community.JPG','','width=660,height=500')"><strong>community 
                    house</strong></a> and a huge <strong><a href="#06" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/cleaning2.JPG','','width=660,height=500')">pile 
                    of leaves</a></strong> which we were told we had to clean 
                    individually, leaf by leaf. Usually only women work on the 
                    leaves but for some reason, they decided they wanted the men 
                    to try it also.</p>
                  <p><img src="../images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="14" vspace="3">At 
                    first, cleaning the leaves seemed an impossible and endless 
                    task. They gave us Daime to drink, however, and after a while 
                    the entire task suddenly changed into something intensely 
                    pleasurable. I felt each leaf was presenting itself like a 
                    little female deity that demanded attention. It seemed that 
                    the medicine was teaching us how to take care of it. Immersed 
                    in the task, I lost all track of time.</p>

                    the most important spiritual centers of the Santo Daime. By 
                    Western standards, it is a very rudimentary place -- no phone, 
                    no electricity, no running water. The <strong><a href="#07" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/casa.JPG','','width=660,height=500')">houses</a></strong> 
                    are strung off long jungle paths like beads on a string. A

                    soon learned to follow the example of the villagers, who were 
                    good at keeping still and conserving their energy during the 
                    hottest parts of the day. They were very friendly to us, and 
                    seemed to support us for having made this long trip to visit 
                    them and participate in their rituals. Without judgment, we 
                    were welcomed into the life of the community.</p>

                    had two <strong><a href="#09" onClick="MM_openBrWindow('images/healing.JPG','','width=660,height=500')">ceremonies</a></strong>, 
                    presided over by Padrinho Alfredo, who is the leader of the 
                    church. I was very impressed with Alfredo. He had a very gentle 
                    manner, yet I had immediate trust in him, and in his mastery 
                    of the Daime. The ceremonies were extraordinarily beautiful 
                    and moving. I found that I really wanted to be connected to 
                    this tradition, which had established such a direct connection 
                    to the sacred. Two of my friends felt the same way. Before 
                    we left the jungle, we decided we would join the church. We 
                    told Luis Fernando of our decision.</p>
                  <p><img src="../images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="14" vspace="3">The 
                    last ceremony we had there was a healing ritual. The energy 
                    became so huge, the visions so intense, I was worried that 
                    we would be unable to contain it, but Alfredo stayed firm 
                    at the rudder. At times I could see the &#8220;Mother of the 
                    Forest,&#8221; like a vast astral being, twirling over our 
                    heads. I could feel what I can only describe inadequately 
                    as the Divine Presence, at the center of the room, above the 
                    altar, where the energy of the singers was focused. I could 
                    see astral beings who seemed to be coming up to me bearing 
                    flowers and fruit.</p>
                  <p><img src="../images/pixel.gif" width="1" height="1" hspace="14" vspace="3">For 
                    a long time I had this sense that there was a dark figure 
                    by my left side, and I was scared it was something threatening. 
                    Finally, in my visionary state, I looked and realized it was 
                    Alfredo himself, reaching out a hand to me. In my vision, 
                    I shook his hand. He gave me a wonderful smile, and vanished.</p>

                    through smaller tributaries to reach our boat on the river. 
                    For something like half an hour, an eagle flew along with 
                    us, gliding from tree to tree as we proceeded. It seemed like

                    can come into communion with the divine in this way. The Santo 
                    Daime has expanded me with love and has taught me how I can 
                    gracefully and humbly carry love in my heart as I walk through 
                    this world that struggles with so much darkness.</p>

                    I read this little passage from a book I have by St Theresa 
                    of Avila while on our return. It aptly applies;</p>
                  <blockquote> 
                    <p> <em>&#8220;I have myself seen and I know by experience 
                      that the soul in rapture is mistress of everything, and 
                      gains such freedom in one hour or even less that it cannot 
                      recognize itself. It perfectly well sees that this is not 
                      it&#8217;s own achievement, and does not know how it has 
                      come to possess such a blessing. Now comes the distress 
                      of having to return to life. Now the soul has grown wings 
                      that can bear it, and has shed it&#8217;s weak feathers. 
                      Now the standard is lifted high for Christ, and it really 
                      seems as if the captain of the fort is climbing, or being 
                      lifted, to the highest tower, there to raise it aloft in 
                      Gods name.&#8221;</em><br>
                    </p>
