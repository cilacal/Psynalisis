<!-- Start Body -->
After obtaining some 2ci from an online vendor I decided to give it a test run at my friends house. I consumed 10mg orally at approximately 9:30 P.M.<br>
<br>
After a 50 minute onset:<br>
I immediately felt a distinct body buzz and an almost uncomfortable amount of energy while drinking a beer on the porch, everything seemed to have a pulse and moved constantly against my will. We went inside to watch fear and loathing in Las Vegas which was difficult to pay attention to (I had wound up muttering like Hunter S. Thompson throughout the night). My friend had made me ramen noodles which I found difficult to eat and I made a bit of a mess on his floor. I grew very, very warm so I had to take my shirt off for a little bit. <br>
<br>
After the film about 1.5 to 2 hours in: <br>
I felt very unsettled when my friend put on the yellow submarine so I had elected to go into his kitchen do some yoga and listen to my music player on his speakers. Listening to music settled my nerves and I made some tea and drank water constantly. I had to wash a pot to make the tea, next thing I knew it was almost as if my eyes could ONLY focus on how dirty the kitchen was. <br>
<br>
3-5 hours in, I can only clean at this point:<br>
I found myself incredibly bothered by the present condition of the kitchen so after my friends and I stepped out for a smoke I felt the need to clean it and make things more symmetrical. I mopped his floor, did all his dishes that had piled up, sorted his mail in more aesthetically pleasing manner, sorted his laundry and organized his groceries that were still bags. While I was performing this task I performed multiple compulsive behaviors, I periodically made a mug of tea or drank a glass of water, muttered to myself, slicked my hair back and did yoga. <br>
<br>
6-8 hours in, time to relax:<br>
After the kitchen as well as the hallway were thoroughly cleaned I felt much calmer, I sat down on the floor ate some bags of dried figs and apricots and just appreciated the symmetry of the room I just sorted out and cleaned. After much more water and music I felt very at ease. By this point I had stopped tripping for the most part, oddly enough I got no visuals from anything but the kitchen floor. I concluded that because of the color scheme of the tiles on the floor, it constantly looked dirty to me but there was no way for me to clean thus patterns danced all over. It was very strange as I could look at another room and feel fine but as soon as I looked at the floor things started moving. After I had comedown to that degree I just decided to lay down on the couch and relax shortly after I went home and went to bed. Trying to sleep was difficult as the stimulant effect gave me more energy than I knew what to do with.<br>
<br>
In Summary:<br>
This wasn't a bad trip but a very strange one, it did seem that I had temporary Obsessive Compulsive Disorder. It could have just been that I had become very anxious from all the stimulation and cleaning was the only thing that could settle my mind at that point. For my personal use I may just elect to take a small dose when my house requires a great deal of cleaning.<!-- End Body -->
