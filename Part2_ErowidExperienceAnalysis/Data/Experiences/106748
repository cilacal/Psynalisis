I have lots of experience with various other benzos, Alprazolam, Diazepam, and Clonazepam.<br/>
<br/>
The day started before on a thursday before an upcoming flight for vacation. Having a natural anxiety of flying, I ordered some clonazolam. The vial had a yellow color contained 150mg / 15ml of solution.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='erowid-warning'>[Erowid Note: 
The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]</span><br/>
<br/>
The last thing I remember was dosing .5 ml of the liquid. The next thing I remember I was searching for my car keys trying to go to the gas station to buy beer. Unable to find my car keys, I jumped on my bicycle and rode to the convenient store. This was the last thing I remember.<br/>
<br/>
I remember my mom caught me pulling into the driveway holding a case of beer.. I dropped it and immediatly ran upstairs to my room. I awoke the next day around noon having missed my flight. I immidiatley found myself angry ashamed and confused that I had missed my flight. I picked up the phone mumbling some kind of gibberish angry that my father had allowed me to miss this vacation over a missed flight.<br/>
<br/>
I finally awoke saturday morning to my room with the door ripped off and my mom terrified downstairs. I asked what has happened and she filled me in with the acts from the day before. I had angrly called my father and told him all this stuff about how he was irresponsible and vacation was more important than helping support my family. I have no memory of thursday or friday. It's saturday and my mind is starting to come back. My mom still refuses to give me my car keys. I'm left embarassed and I know I have significantly damaged alot of my personal relationships.<!-- End Body -->
