I have had adhd for seven years, and struggled daily with school. My senior year, my parents and I demanded the doctors put me on some type of medicine. I was put on adderall, my brother had been on it and it worked for him. Within two weeks my grades went from D's to all A's, I woke up dreary, but within 20 minutes after my first pill, I felt a rush of energy starting in my stomach and finally an all over body rush. I would talk nonstop, and was motivated, it was like a dream. After school I would go to work and stay until 10:30.<br>
<br>
Thats when I began to first abuse. At the sign of sleepiness I would pop a pill. For months I was taking 20mg 4 times a day.After awhile, the buzz would totally wear off, and leave me hanging.I would talk and not make much sense, I lost my strong relationship to my boyfriend, because of my carelessness. A couple days after that I withdrew from adderall, and felt the rush in my body I had wanted without the drug, but not the help with concentrating. So I once again began responsibly taking adderall, vowing not to abuse.<br>
<br>
Right now I am in a worse situation. I am eating them like candy, with or without the 'high'. My eyes sag, Im tired earlier, my hands shake uncontrollably,and during the day I feel nauscious and constantly dizzy, so dizzy I cannot concentrate on anything at all.I am irritable, and as much as I want to party with my friends,I never call. I have always been a sexual person, but lately I have been going too far. I read an experience of someone who also had this problem with masturbating. I can go on for 2-3 hours until I bleed. I have figured out that I need to lay off the adderall, and wait till I'm back to normal, because of these side affects, but Im afraid I wont be able to get anything done. :(<!-- End Body -->
