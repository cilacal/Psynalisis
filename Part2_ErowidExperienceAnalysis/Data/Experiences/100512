For this trip I acquired 2 1500ug tabs of 25i-nBome (2c-i-nbome) from a friend who had tried tabs from the same batch so could vouch for their safety. This friend did not however know whether they were complexed which is why I held the tab in my mouth for so long to be sure it had absorbed completely. 1500 ug of this chemical is considered a strong dose and I personally would not recommend this to someone not experienced in some psychedelics or possibly dissociatives.<br>
<br>
I had not done any extra physical preparations for tripping on this chemical leading up to taking it, I ate a small lunch a few hours before taking it and meditated for an hour or so before a friend arrived who also took a tab. Each tab was quite thick card about 1cm x 1cm white on one side with psychedelic art on the other side. This was my third time tripping and I would consider the last couple of hours a 'bad trip'.<br>
<br>
Setting: In my flat with friend A for a few hours with friend B joining us a few hours into the trip. Friend A also took the chemical but friend B was just tripsitting and smoking weed. Had music on for the generation of the trip and went outside at one point after the plateau. <br>
<br>
Outcomes/Experience: I am writing this report a few weeks after this experience so I cannot go into as much detail as I would like. I also failed to make any notes during or shortly after this trip. <br>
<br>
A and I took a tab each and held them in our mouths, against our gums, sometimes moving them around when necessary, for at least an hour. It was extremely difficult to resist swallowing spit and by the time we were ready to spit the tabs out or swallow them our mouths were full of saliva. I tried to swallow my tab and saliva and retched because I could suddenly taste how bitter and metallic the substance was. I purged in the toilet and A just spat out his tab. We were still sat listening to music for nearly another hour before feeling any effects.<br>
<br>
Coming up took a long time and the initial effects were clear headedness and the kind of excitement bordering on euphoria that happens when coming up on most drugs. The main aspect of this trip was the visuals. Open eye visuals took over my whole field of vision but weren't too distorted in that objects were morphing and shifting, it was mostly patterns and flowing. Closed eye visuals were the deepest and most complex I had seen before, for me being mostly red and infinitely changing fractal patterns. The effects came in waves of intensity and music was extremely stimulating. At one point in the trip, friend B got in and sat with us before we peaked. The peak was extremely pleasant however the speed at which the waves of intensity came in was quite abrupt and unexpected meaning communication was near impossible. If I could compare this trip to my experiences with analogues of psilocyn then I would say those other trips felt more natural whereas this felt forced even if enjoyable. The visual aspect was not too overbearing even though all encompassing. We felt able to go for a walk to the park which was very interesting and although I had some paranoia about people knowing I was tripping I managed to enjoy our walk with friend B guiding us. At the park the visuals on a grassy hill were beautiful and made the grass look more alive. Walking around was easy and the terraced houses didn't make the streets feel claustrophobic as I had felt on other trips.<br>
<br>
As time went on, the intensity faded and after 7 or 8 hours we began to smoke some weed. After a joint I became very relaxed and enjoyed putting on some cartoons. After another joint though and another couple of hours I started to have a bad trip however this may have just been the comedown. It was hard to tell, really, the effects of the 2c-i-nbome should have subsided by this point. The bad trip consisted of me finding the simple story of what we were watching extremely hard to follow and some auditory hallucinations. At one point I heard my phone ringing and it was just a hallucination. I was getting very confused and paranoid that the mix of these chemicals had done some mental damage although I'd read up on it and it shouldn't have. I was getting into worrying thought loops about whether this experience was going bad and whether I should tell A or B what I was thinking. Friend A went home after having both the 2c-i-nbome and some weed feeling great which made me think I shouldn't worry B because it was just me being paranoid. I decided after a while to just go to sleep and, thankfully, as soon I was in bed and had put some music on, the thoughts disappeared and I enjoyed the music more than usual. <br>
<br>
After Effects: I woke up the next day feeling great, with some enhanced tactile sensitivity. Music was still sounded extremely stimulating and I spent most of the day relaxing, listening to music and feeling my stubble. All of the negative aspects of the trip were gone and, unlike with my past trip experiences, I had absolutely no symptoms of HPPD. Usually I would always see patterns on my carpet still, nowhere near as vividly as when tripping, but still there, like a shadow of a former visual.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: I enjoyed this trip which lasted considerably longer than trips I've had previously. If I was to take it again I would not smoke weed and go to sleep as soon as I start to feel the negative comedown effects.<!-- End Body -->
