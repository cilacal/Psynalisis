This was the most amazing, surreal, unexplainable, blissful, moving experience I have ever had in my life. The atmosphere was right. The room was fairly big and the lighting was soft. There was soft music playing thru speakers at the end of the bed that I lay in. <br/>
<br/>
There were a small group of people in the room holding energy, and there was a guide that administered the drug in a pure, vaporized form. As I lay on the bed, I was ready. My heart pounded. I reminded myself to surrender and breathe. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">My heart pounded. I reminded myself to surrender and breathe.</div></div> I was administered 9mg on my first offering. As I hit the lamp, I lay back into the bed. I remember laying back. But, before the vapor could escape my lungs, I was catapulted into nothingness. Fractal designs with no symmetry surrounded and engulfed me. I was it. I continued my journey deeper, surrendering deeper. I was total bliss. I was eternal, I was no ego. A million men could spend a million years trying to tell me what my experience would be like, and they wouldn’t have come close to even touching on the beginning of the amazing awesomeness I was experiencing. The light was white, but not too bright. I was everywhere all at once. I was the unfolding energy pulsating out of myself into everything all at once. “Oh my God” kept coming out of my mouth. Slowly and deeply, at times not even finishing one sentence before starting in on another “Oh my God”. I was total enlightenment. Everything made perfect sense without trying to make sense of anything. <br/>
<br/>
As I slowly began to melt back into ego, I touched my fingers together to let my guide know that I was beginning to drift back into self. I was only gone for 4 minutes. If someone would have asked me how long I had been gone, I would not have had an answer for them. My visions of the room were very slowed down, and a little blurry, but it was very comfortable. I could hear soft music in the background and I could feel the energy the group was holding. <br/>
<br/>
I was then offered the lamp once more, with pure love and pure trust. Once again I was given 9mg of pure 5-MeO-DMT in vaporized form. I looked into the eyes of my guide and the invitation was filled with pure love. I took another deep breath in and fell back into the bed with my arms out. I was instantly catapulted into deeper depths of beauty and bliss with full surrender and acceptance. Again, I was the I am. There was no ego. Just bliss. I had no sense of time and space, I was eternal. As I came back into my self once more after being gone for 15 minutes, I was again offered the lamp of light with pure love and pure trust. The final time, I was given 12mg. <br/>
<br/>
My body hit the launching pad and I began to rise. I could see the pure energy surrounding my friend in front of me. I could see the Buddha within him. He moved slowly to bow to the spirit within me and his offering was met with pure bliss. I offered the same back to him. I called for another member and she was there, offering beautiful energy full of love. She was radiating. I could feel the energy moving thru me, so powerfully that I began to move around. The energy was taking me over and there was no fighting it. It was release. A much needed release from my normal routine of bundling energy up. It was beautiful. <br/>
<br/>
As I finally started to come back into self for the last time, I could feel magnificent pulses of blissful energy radiating thru my body. It felt like my body was having a spiritual orgasm. There is no other way to describe it. I was in the middle of blissful eternity and physical euphoria. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">I was in the middle of blissful eternity and physical euphoria.</div></div> Even as I write this, I can feel my body rise. As the beautiful feeling started to subside, I could feel myself coming back into self more deeply. My ego was back, and I was instantly concerned that I had done something to embarrass myself. As I started to see the looks on the faces of those who surrounded me, I could see that they were moved by the experience they witnessed.  I remember being comforted by that. It. Was. Amazing! My first spoken words after the experience were 'I went there, and now I get it. I understand.'<br/>
<br/>
This experience has changed my life. It has offered a significant perspective shift and I feel a closeness and comfort to the energy and love that connects us all. This love must be given away. This gift is not meant to be held on to. I believe more people in the world need to experience this. This compound is not something to be played with. I was in a very controlled and calm environment. I would not recommend doing this alone. <!--However, if the opportunity presents itself, and you feel like you're ready for a full surrender to pure love and bliss, then take the leap. It might change you forever. I know it did for me.--><!-- End Body -->
