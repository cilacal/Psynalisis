I don't often have 'happy' trips, although I nearly always gain some insight from every trip I have.  However, the trip before this last one was horribly terrifying as well as uninsightful--an eighth of mushrooms after a day of fasting--so I felt more than a little shy of psychedelics when I decided to try my most recent addition, 2C-I.<BR>
<BR>
To reduce my greater than usual anxiety, I had purchsed a 5x Blue Lotus powdered extract and made a tea from it.  I steeped about 2.5g of the powder in boiling water for 25min, let it cool and gulped it down.  The aroma and taste strongly reminded me of mushroom tea--quite unpleasant considering my prior trip.<BR>
<BR>
After having read about 2C-I's extended coming-up time, I took the 15mg cap immediately after the tea and prepared to leave for a nice psytrance party.<BR>
<BR>
For the next two hours, I sat in my car with some friends, N, C, and B (also tripping except for the driver) in stop and go traffic.  Fortunately, the mildly positive mood lift from the lotus left me indifferent to our situation.  Relaxed and sedated, I just sat back and enjoyed the company.<BR>
<BR>
(T+1:15) We had driven halfway over the bridge and I finally started getting my first alert: yawning.  And yawning and yawning.  My friend N informed me that people yawn when coming up because it's entering a dream state, and first we must fall asleep out of our normal game reality.  I like that.<BR>
<BR>
(T+1:45) Thirty minutes later and we're inside the venue, B and I heading for the dance floor and N & C unleasing their pipe.  The noticeable effects of blue lotus had worn off by now and I was eagerly awaiting 2C-I to come out and play.  In the meantime, the music was great, the crowd was wild, and I slowly settled into the atmosphere.<BR>
<BR>
(T+2:30) I had been at threshold for about half an hour now--mild visuals and trippiness--and started worrying that I didn't take enough.  However I'm usually quite sensitive to the tryptamines and this entheogen supposedly takes awhile to kick in, so I decided to give it another half hour before giving it a boost.<BR>
<BR>
(T+3:00) No change--this was as high as I was going to get.  I informed B of my status, and he weaved us back to N & C, who quite willingly smoked me out.  Two tokes, and we streamed back to the floor.<BR>
<BR>
(T+3:30) The 2C-I finally burst from out of its shell and its gentle touch was sweet.  Dancing became more than just a fun activity--it became the sole medium of my expression.  I poured every drop of my concentration into the moment and the music, dancing with abandon as I closed my eyes.  Crowded as the floor was, I surprisingly didn't collide with anyone, even during my more exuberant moves.  It was quite an amazing experience, this dancing; I had never quite experienced any other dancing that approached this intensity.<BR>
<BR>
Closing my eyes, I was aware of medium level visuals, but they paled in comparison to the mental shift.  Deep within my dancing, I spontaneously began meditating, taking in deep, long breaths through my diaphragm, feeling more than thinking my mantra: 'Breathe in serenity, breathe out serenity...'  A profound stillness spread out from my center, quietly pervading my body entire, until I felt encased in a smooth peacefulness.<BR>
<BR>
Ironically, my body was moving faster than ever, but it seemed I looked out from this vessel with an ancient stillness at odds with the vibrant atmosphere just beyond my arms' reaches.  I viewed the world with heavy-lidded eyes, but closed them so that I may best savor this sweet bliss.<BR>
<BR>
As my body spent its energy, my mind slowly wandered through eastern philosophies, understanding and making connections with a normally dormant insight.  So many things I learned in this state, so many lessons I no longer recall.  I understood that this would happen and bade myself remember at least these two, most important understandings, one an answer to a philosophical riddle that had been plaguing me.  The other an answer to a question I had not yet asked.  I won't divulge them here.<BR>
<BR>
(T+5:15) By about 4am, my quiet serenity had passed, replaced by an equisite bliss for having experienced the best trip and the greatest meditation of my life.  If you believe in such things, I now understand that I had taken a sip of samadhi, basked in its glory for a blink of time.  <BR>
<BR>
I cannot say how long I took to come down, for I had eaten some Adderall due to police harassment while driving back home.  However, I did take note of extremely mild visual patterning and a happy glow for a week afterward.  And of course, the lovemaking was great on the comedown.<BR>
<BR>
From this single experience, I consider 2C-I to be even more psychedelic than LSD, shrooms, or any other psychedelic I've tried so far (note: this doesn't include DMT or salvia...yet).  The others I've tried either take me into my own mind or their own world and include more sensory delights, less mental mysticism.  All in all, I think I'll be making this my entheogen of choice.<!-- End Body -->
