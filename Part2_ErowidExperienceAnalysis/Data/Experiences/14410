first let me state this, i have used amt 4 times before at 40 milligrams all times and thought i was quite aware of what happened with it. this time i had got 1 gram of freebase and weighed it myself, i had weighed each capsule at 40 mg and decided i should just lick up my mess, afterall i was going out that night. i believe i licked up around 30 mg or so of the smelly substance. i went out and had a great time, had some visualls but nothing too big, i mostly concentrated on the fire. coming home i went to sleep with no trouble as i had been out for about 11 hours or so. woke with no hangover or after effects continued with my day and fell asleep again. i got up and had school,(this is 36 hrs since i had taken the AMT) so realizing i had gotten no sleep (about 2 hrs) i consumed 5 caffein pills, i think they were vivarin, which i usually take 4 to 5. <BR>
<BR>
BIG MISTAKE, i was sitting in class aobut 30 min later and the caffein kicked in, i got very lightheaded, nausiated, and started to shake. i got up ran to the bathroom and returned thinking if i just pulled myself together it would go away, BIG MISTAKE again. i left about 10 min after comeing back from the bathroom and managed to drive home safely. during my time at home i vomited 5 times in a 5 hr period and kept going in and out of concisnous, i felt my life on the brink and called a friend to help comfort me. that helped a lot as my friend kept me awake also, i'm glad i did not fall asleep. this whole caffein experience lasted around 12 hrs and then i finally thought it was safe to sleep. i went to sleep and awoke the next day in the late afternoon. i guess my lesson is don't take caffein with AMT unless u are positive that the substance is out of your body. other than that AMT is a very enjoyable substance and i hope to try 5meo-amt soon.<!-- End Body -->
