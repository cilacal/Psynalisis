Set: A nice quiet Friday evening at home<br>
<br>
<br>
T: 0.00 – I decided to get some paperwork done so gradually insufflated  approximately 35mg of methylphenidate.HCl.  Needless to say productivity skyrocketed and music was thoroughly appreciated. The stimulant was metabolized a few hours later and the dopamine depletion made me somewhat aggressive and anxious.<br>
<br>
<br>
T: +9:00 – A couple of medium sized poppy pods were crushed and brewed for 30 minutes subsequently consumed with a wee bit of super silver haze. It knocked me out pretty quickly and essentially I turned nocturnal from this point onwards. <br>
<br>
<br>
T: + 21:00 – I placed a single blotter hit containing 800ug uncomplexed 25I-NBOMe between my upper lip and gum. I didn’t feel any immediate taste but I kept my saliva anyway. In about 40 minutes I finally placed the blotter under my tongue and felt the already fading chemical taste. It wasn’t unpleasant, though as a chemist I enjoy chemicals so that may have something to do with it.<br>
<br>
<br>
T: +22:00 – It was already getting dark again and I noticed my vision was a bit blurred. I was calm knowing that I have properly prepared the hits (I have a d=0.1mg scale at my disposal plus Gilson pipettes that go down to >0.5&#956;l volume so we’re safe with regard to proper dosage). Eventually I noticed a familiar pattern of visual distortion, these fractal vines slowly started creeping in and I felt quite good. The opiates were still active at this point.<br>
<br>
<br>
T: +24:00 – My god music was better than sex. Every tone and frequency were propagating an electrochemical vibe through pre-defined neural circuits eventually escaping my brain to slide down my spine and send every cell of my body into heaven. At some point a particular track started playing and this was the point where my senses literally exploded. It is not easy to describe but I experienced severe auditory-tactile synesthesia. Every beat was like an orgasm with a specific sensual buzz. I then switched on the lights and was simply overwhelmed by the visuals. My wall is pretty dull yellow-ish colour but in this context it appeared like Jupiter’s surface with an organic undertone. The hallucinations were less geometric that the OEVs I have experienced on LSD yet they’re still utterly amazing. However, I perceived them more as a bonus to the music appreciation aspect. I could very clearly differentiate between mp3 quality and FLAC quality tracks. Definitely music appreciation was out of this world. I was going through cycles, I’d feel this wave of anxiety which explodes in a splash of utter joy and then the negative feeling begins to accumulate again and thus cycling for a while. Ego death was noted.<br>
<br>
<br>
T: +26:00 – I was in heaven. Extreme eyecandy wrapped in a warming nod coupled to auditory sex. The only thing that frightened me is how amazingly beautiful and pleasant this combo was. I was tripping hard as either time perception was quite distorted or it just took me forever to get simple tasks done. I felt very artistic at this point, started playing with lights and prisms to make some psychedelic photographs. So far it was an amazing hedonistic psychedelic experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
T: +28:00 – I found it very hard to roll a joint. My first attempt at rolling a spliff failed miserably, so I spent a good 30 minutes trying to get stoned. And I did. That’s when things started to go a bit downhill. I started to get anxious, progressively worsening. <br>
<br>
<br>
T: +30:00 – I am still tripping hard. I want to take a break so I took a walk outside. I felt waves of paranoia creeping in so quickly went back home. I wanted to lie down but as soon as I did I wanted to get up again. I started dancing with my headphones on because I felt very speedy. My heart was racing and I experienced stomach pain. At this point I started thinking I’m having a heart attack and got slightly panicked but still managed to keep my shit together. Eventually a valium was consumed.<br>
<br>
<br>
T: +34:00 – I decided to take another walk outside. Once the anxiety was annihilated by the diazepam I could appreciate the psychedelic mindset again. I was observing the plants and it occurred to me how their interrelatedness stems from the fact that they all share common nucleotide sequences and their taxonomy is a function of the said sequence similarities. That sort of thoughts transpired to everything that surrounds me. I finally felt serene and in peace with myself. Music was still incredible, visuals not as intense.<br>
<br>
<br>
T: +36:00 – I finally got back home and tried to re-evaluate what happened but felt mentally drained after all the drugs I had done. I passed out soon after.<br>
<br>
<br>
T: +45:00 – Woke up at around 9PM and I usually get anxious when I switch to being nocturnal. Smoked a joint and spotted a baggie of poppy seeds. I had no intention on consuming those but being stoned and hungry like never before I quickly munched on them (they are very tasty). I passed out around 2AM that evening and reverted my nocturnal cycle.<br>
<br>
Conclusion: 25I-NBOMe is my favourite research chemical. It felt unhealthy yet amazing. Next time I would take it a rave because with 25B-NBOMe I noticed that the body load disappears as I move actively. I found it very useful to have some valium on hand during the experience.<!-- End Body -->
