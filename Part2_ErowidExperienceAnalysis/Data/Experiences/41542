Last night I had my first AMT experience.  While I am well versed in various psychedelics, I have been relatively clean for a couple years and have recently felt the desire to revisit the realm.  I am lucky enough to have a little AMT I kept from when it was still unscheduled, and even though it was a few years old, it seemed to retain its potentency well.  Since this was much first time in a while, I wanted a relatively low, background dose.<BR>
<BR>
I didn't have much AMT so to make the most of it my friend and I decided to snort 10-15mg at 3:30pm.  We were also somewhat apprehensive about a 20 hour trip and reasoned snorting would shorten the trip at least a little bit.  This stuff burns a bit is is quite unpleasant in the nose for 20-30 minutes afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
Very shortly (whithin a half hour), I start to feel the familiar psychedelic buzz.  A beautiful sense of warmth, mellow energy, alertness, and well being.  I take a shower and the water feels incredible.  <BR>
<BR>
T+3:00 I play music with my band, which both sounds and feels amazing. I am at a solid plus one.<BR>
<BR>
T+5:00 we head to a friend's house for a predominately alcohol-oriented gathering.  I feel fine with this since the trip isn't very intense and I am comfortable with everyone there.  At this stage I feel very empathic, relaxed, and talkative, but all still distincly psychedelic.  Confirming what I've read previously, this feels like a combination of LSD and MDMA, although in my situation, a low dose of each.  Everything is very mellow and easy to take, with a wonderful sense of well-being that I've missed from psychedelics.  I am able to ignore it and concentrate on other things if I desire, but it is clearly there and positively effects my interaction with others all night.  <BR>
<BR>
When I finally go to bed at T+12:00 I am still going strong, having experienced plus one for over 10 hours.  I am tired (from the day and from the trip), and I am able to sleep without much problem.<BR>
<BR>
I wake up at T+18:00 still feeling effects!  I wouldn't even call it a plus one anymore, but it is definitely still there.  The rest of the day gradually blends into normality.  <BR>
<BR>
Being initiated to psychedelics on mushrooms and occasional LSD, I was slightly unprepared for this long of a trip.  However, at this low dose it was easily manageable and pleasant throughout.  I would imagine that at a higher dose the length might begin to grow tiresome.<!-- End Body -->
