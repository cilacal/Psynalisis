Today was the 6 month anniversary of my friend L's suicide. I woke up around noon, after a very short night's sleep, and went with several friends to go put flowers on her grave. We spent quite some time there, and it was pretty hard for me today... much harder than the past few visits have been. T brought her little sister with her. The juxtaposition of a small child and a grave was very striking, and was a duality which remained with me throughout the day.<BR>
<BR>
After this, R and I went back to my apartment to sample some 5-MeO-DIPT. At 4:20PM, each of us ingested 7mg in a gelcap. I began to feel nostalgic and decided to put on the Grateful Dead movie 'So Far', which also served as nice eye-candy and ear-candy. R reported an alert within 10 minutes. By 5:10 we were going pretty nicely. I personally noticed a much milder trip than I noticed the day before from 6mg. Obviously, 5-MeO-DIPT produces some tolerance - although the degree of tolerance was much less than I would expect from, say, doing LSD two days in a row. R reported that he really liked what he was experiencing, which he compared to the 'good part' of coming down from acid. Other things he reported included some MDMA-like jaw clench and a tension in his neck and shoulders which he described as being right on that borderline between hurting and feeling amazingly good. He reported that he felt very comfortable and that he felt like he could fall asleep, although he thought that if he got up and moved around that the nature of the experience would change to a stimulant to match his activity.<BR>
<BR>
I felt essentially the same kind of experience as he reported and that I got the day before, just on a milder scale due to tolerance. Listening to the Grateful Dead movie playing, I got all nostalgic about the Dead and began telling R about shows I'd been to. A little in to the 'trip' he told me that he would always remember this as the day that he finally really understood the Grateful Dead thing. I found myself wishing that 5-MeO-DIPT had been available when the Dead still played. Throughout all this, I had a very strong, warm feeling of nostalgia, which in a way was a mirror image of the emotions I felt at L's grave earlier. Nostalgia and mourning are flip-sides of a common base emotion. Again, I had the feeling that perhaps this substance has an untapped potential - perhaps there is more here than a purely recreational substance, which is being overlooked because most of the existent trip reports focus on this drug being a recreational or aphrodisiac sensory enhancer. I would like very much to explore this substance in the future as an empathogen, or in a context of emotional cleansing, meditation, or by combining possible mental effects with the well known physical effects in experiments with yoga or tai chi.<BR>
<BR>
A few hours later, around 8:30PM, we drove over to meet friends and then go to the Fairfax Fair. When we left, I felt that the effects had worn off, however, a mile or two down the road I began to realize they were not. The sky looked unusually beautiful, trees were exuberantly green, and I felt a little off baseline still. I vowed to myself to try this drug outdoors as soon as possible.<BR>
<BR>
When we met our friends, I gave B 2 capsules containing the last 12mg of of 5-MeO-DIPT. She ate one and gave her boyfriend C the other as we were arriving at the fair. An hour later they reported it kicking in, but they didn't feel the effects very well, and thought that the environment was too hectic to be able to focus on the subtle effects this drug has. They reported feeling good, but not much more. At the fair, I felt a little bit of physical effect still, and colors were a little brighter still. I found the hectic environment amusing, and enjoyed the notion that I was here in the middle of a suburbanite family affair in such a humorously twisted state - undercover in Middle America. What took me by surprise though was that I found myself paying alot more attention to the female members of the crowd that I would normally. I kept finding myself staring and having amusingly randy thoughts. It was enjoyable, I found this heightened awareness to be funny and a much nicer entertainment than the cheezy overpriced fair rides and games. By the time we left the fair, around 11PM, this effect had vanished along with all others, except for a pleasant, mild glow. I went home and had a nice long, restful sleep.<BR>
<BR>
<HR><BR>
<BR>
As a follow-up... I spoke with my friend B today, and she told me that she had in fact found the 5-MeO-DIPT experience strong. Her and C found themselves unable to fall asleep until around 5:30AM. They have both expressed an interest in repeating the experiment.<!-- End Body -->
