I hadn't had much experiences with chemicals before this, apart from amphetamine and one crappy ecstasy pill, although I am quite experienced with natures psychedelics.<BR>
<BR>
It was around 3pm when I bought one capsule of 5-MeO DiPT from a friend of mine with was supposed to contain 35mg of the thing.<BR>
<BR>
After that I went to my friend to ingest it and just when I got to my friends apartment the other friend with I bought the capsule called me and told me to wait until he makes sure that he didn't accidentally sell me a  capsule with 45 mg.<BR>
<BR>
Well, I waited about for one hour (it was around 5pm) and after that I couldn't wait no longer, so I decided to open the capsule and split the thing in 3 parts and take 2/3 myself and let my friend ingest 1/3.<BR>
<BR>
I had heard that 5-MeO DiPT could be insufflated so I snorted the 2/3 of the capsule while my friend took his part orally.<BR>
<BR>
That was a big mistake, the thing burned my nose like hell!<BR>
<BR>
Well as I was sitting on the chair and suffering from the burn after 15 minutes I noticed that I was feeling pretty strange, the feeling could be compared to the first feeling I got from magic mushrooms, the 'what the fuck is happening? And, of course, feelings of heavy nausea.<BR>
<BR>
The next thing I noticed was that the walls started to move in waves and some strange tribal patterns appeared on them.<BR>
<BR>
As I was observing the hallucination, I suddenly noticed I was giggling hysterically.<BR>
<BR>
My friend didn't feel much yet and he and his girlfriend started to tease my mind with all kinds of strange suggestions, and only thing I wanted to do was to listen the music ( if I remember right it was something from Hallucinogen) as it sounded greater than anything.<BR>
<BR>
After awhile I noticed that I couldn't speak properly anymore, my voice started to lower it's tone as I spoke, this was extremely weird, but still extremely fun.<BR>
<BR>
Suddenly I noticed that I was charged with this strange energy and started to move with the music and everything felt so alive and beautiful.<BR>
<BR>
My friend had already started to feel effects and we started to examine the wallpapers together, this was too much for his sober girlfriend, who immediately left home.<BR>
<BR>
I don’t have clear memory of the time passing, but I think it was about 3 hours after ingesting the drug when I reached the peak, I felt energy, open-minded and extremely good, and after forming  the feeling into a proper sentence in my mind, I said to my friend: 'This is like having sex with your own mind.'<BR>
<BR>
Well, we talked a lot with my friend and I wondered around the apartment, examining every corner of it as everything was feeling so interesting because of the hallucinations.<BR>
<BR>
Around 8pm I started to come down, although I was still feeling mentally great, I had drained all the energy I had out of my body and stated to feel a bit tired. <BR>
<BR>
I stayed in my friends until 11:30pm and then left home. I was constantly thinking in my mind: 'That was GREAT.'<BR>
<BR>
As I got home I ate some bread and went to bed, as I turned the lights off I noticed that the hallucinations were still there as I noticed some swirling images on my walls. It took around 1hour until I fell asleep.<!-- End Body -->
