After work I decided to mix some cannabis with some damiana. I really just did this because I didn't want to get too stoned, but I needed some filler for the cigarette. I had originaly bought the damiana along with some skullcap which I make a tea out of (very relaxing).<BR>
<BR>
The smoke of the damiana was harsh compared to the cannabis. I could taste each seperately and feel each seperately in my lungs, and the damiana had a distinct 'tea' taste that burned my throat. The effects seemed to hit me both harder and weaker in different ways than just cannabis normally would. I seemed a little more mentally stoned than normal, and less of a body buzz. I noticed my neck muscles were tight, but I passed it off as an effect from work earlier. <BR>
<BR>
Later in the night I rolled up a mixture of cannabis, damiana, and skullcap in three equal amounts. After a few beers at a party, I had a nice little buzz going. I decided to smoke the joint mixture with another friend. The smoke was still harsh somewhat, but considering I had more cannabis it was more tolerable than earlier. The taste of the skullcap also seemed to dominate the damiana (not a bad thing). <BR>
<BR>
This time the effects hit me a lot harder, which could largely be attributed to the alcohol that was also in my system... but in my experience that small of an amount of alcohol usually won't effect a cannbis high as greatly as it did. The mental effects were definetly heightened. I felt on the verge of anxiety if I didn't occupy my mind with something. Mentally, it was almost similar to the onset of a trip... I could hear the overpowering effect of everyone's conversations at once. I got into a 'thought loop' about why the mental effects were so strong while the physical effects were still almost unapparent. When I say physical effects, I mean the nice, warm, buzzing sensation associated with a cannabis high. There were physical effects that came on... more of the uncomfortable tightness in my neck, and my back and shoulder muscles felt cramped. It was very uncomfortable, and almost to the point where I regretted smoking it in the first place. Eventually these effects went away (after I consumed more alcohol, which may have contributed to the loosening/relaxing of my muscles).<BR>
<BR>
Although I haven't tried the skullcap alone or with cannabis by themselves, I'd still attribute the negative physical effects to the damiana. Not only did it happen twice in one day, it also was amplified when I smoked more of it. Overall, I recommend just sticking with the marijuana for smoking, and leave the damiana and skullcap for making tea.<!-- End Body -->
