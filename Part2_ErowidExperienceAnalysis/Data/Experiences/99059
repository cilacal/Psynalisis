So at this time I was 19. It was in December (spice products became illegal in January) and I just got a new batch of NBOMe blotters. I've been experienced with these before, I had tripped approximately 12 times before this experience. I always took 2 mg (2 blotters) of 25i-NBOMe. Well, I told my buddy that these weren't doing it for me and it was getting kinda expensive and to kick it up a notch. Little did I know, that I was about to have the trip of my life with the new batch.<br>
<br>
Now, he said these were stronger and there was a larger dose to each blotter (2mg/blotter). What he didn't tell me is he changed the type of NBOMe. I am used to 25i; he gave me 25c. 25c is far more visual, and 25i is more of a high an euphoric feeling.<br>
<br>
+0:00. I put the blotters in to test around 6pm after work, careful to keep on the upper gums for max results. I only do 2 since I know I'll be taking about 4 mg. This is a high dose since they are active at 500 &mu;g.<br>
<br>
+0:30. I kept sucking on them through my upper gums to completely absorb the chemical, and was careful to not swallow my spit. At this point I can definitely feel the effects, and the come-up was a bit rapid for the next half an hour.<br>
<br>
+1:00. I am almost at the peak already, at least the peak of what I'm used to. I started to smoke some ultra strength spice product to better enjoy my high. The moment I hit my water pipe, my roommate (A) came home with a couple of her friends. She doesn't know I do acid, so I had to blame my pupil dilation on the spice.<br>
<br>
+2:00. After chatting for an hour with her friends that I just met, a couple of her other friends came over and brought alcohol. (A) asked me to plug in her wall fan cause (I) was over heating. I found it difficult to move since my heart rate was up, and I was over heating myself. I plugged the fan in, and looked like a complete moron, cause I couldn't figure out how to turn the damn thing on.<br>
<br>
+2:30. Around this time, we start playing beer pong. I've smoked a few bowls of spice now and I am tripping out of my mind. The alcohol wasn't helping much either. Somehow, even as the cups get father away, then close up again, I was able to make a few, and ended up winning 3/3 games.<br>
<br>
+3:00. After a few rounds of beer pong, which felt like forever, I decided to go to the bathroom. I looked at myself, and my eyes are black. Hardly any color is showing anymore and I have full blown visuals. The carpet was swirling and as I looked at the wall behind the toilet, I saw a face in the wall. It creeped me out a little, yet at the same time I was fascinated by this. I drink and talk for a few more hours.<br>
<br>
Time seems to drag on, only a few hours has gone by, and it feels like an entire day has gone by. I am in a slight bit of pain in my legs, it only happens when I move too much. I laugh way too much, everything seems to be funny to me. I am having the time of my life.<br>
<br>
+5:00. Things start to wind down a bit. I decide to smoke from my glass bowl. I hadn't smoked from it in a long time and forgot just how good it hits. I ended up smoking way too much and discover that spice products increase visuals. I was way too high, and had to sit with my face in my hands until I came down a little bit. Every time I looked up, I saw faces in the wall, or I saw people doing things they weren't really doing. I was a little panicky at this moment. My roommate (A) was beside me and I was sure she could tell I was a little out of it.<br>
<br>
After all of that, things started to wind down and a couple people had to leave. Everyone who stayed ended up going to bed. I couldn't sleep till about 3 in the morning because of the NBOMe. Overall, I had a blast. Even though it is a research chemical, it is one of my favorite substances to take. I would recommend anyone to try it. I felt fully rested the next morning, and filled with energy. But usually after that after effect, my body is completely exhausted.<!-- End Body -->
