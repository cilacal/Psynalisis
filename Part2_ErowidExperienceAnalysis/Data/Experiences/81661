<!-- Start Body -->
I have been doing Mephedrone on and off for the past 3 months, aprox 600mg a night. its legal, similar to MDMA, and relatively cheap. This drug is perfect for me. This is one of my best experiences to date. My mood was good, even more so after 4+ beers and some good hard trance/dance/liquid drum & bass to get me in the mood. Previous drug experience = cannabis, magic mushrooms, codeine, small amounts of ecstasy. a lot of alcohol if that counts.<br>
<br>
Start of the night: its Saturday night. I was preparing to go night clubbing with some good friends. I often have a few lagers at home then head out into the local town, meet my mates then go into the city and get drunk (or recently, drunk and Mephedroned)<br>
<br>
T+0:00 - Currently at home. Just had a bath & sorted myself out for the night. I sit in front of my PC and listen to some trance classics, go on Facebook, drink some booze and roll a cig. Dab out aprox 100mg and snort it. My nose has started to grow accustomed to snorting this substance so it doesn't sting that much as it used to. However the drip tastes terrible and usually makes my mouth dry.<br>
<br>
T+0:12 - Heart race increases, thumping away in my chest. Warm fuzzy feeling. Euphoric<br>
<br>
T+0:20 - Drink some more booze and sniff another line. Maybe shouldn't have been so hasty to do this one. Never mind.<br>
<br>
T+0:25 - Definitely coming on now. Clear headed, very sped up. Legs bounce up and down, feeling very excited. Heart is hammering away. Check my eyes and pupils, not too big but noticeable. Turn my music up and wave my arms about. Feel awesome.<br>
<br>
T+0:27 - feeling very blissful, at peace with the world, yet very fast. Get up and move around, feel like superman zipping around the place. Whisper to myself 'Fuck, this feels amazing', breathe heavily. Jaw clenching.<br>
<br>
T+0:45 - Overwhelming urge to ring people, decide to ring a female friend of mine and have a chat. End up having a very deep chat about random rubbish, feels good to chat. Awesome euphoric physical buzz going through my entire body. Text a few people telling them how good I feel and how special they are to me.<br>
<br>
T+0:50 - Realize I need to head up town pretty quickly if I'm going to meet my mates and catch the bus to head into the city. Bomb a small amount, finish my 5th can and walk up town, approx half a mile. Walking feels effortless, almost like gliding. Legs feel light. Everything feels amazing. Can't wait to see my mates. Feels like Christmas as a young child.<br>
<br>
T+1:05 - fuck, I feel good.<br>
<br>
T+1:10 - Meet 5 of my friends, give two of my mates 1/2 a gram between him and her. The rest of my friends with us are just drinkers. Get on the bus, head into the city. Best bus ride I've ever had. Can't stop talking. Apparently my eyes were massive. More jaw clenching and grinding. Get my phone out and play some music, music is a MUST on this conquest. <br>
<br>
T+1:30 - Speak to some random ladys on the bus, get a hug and a kiss on the cheek, say bye to the driver and glide off the bus with my mates. Go to a near-by pub, get a double vodka and coke, my two mates go and snort a line. I do a line shortly after, probably around 100mg, drink my vodka and chat. Feeling very good, talking is so easy I feel more sociable than I've ever felt. Lots of smiling and chatting between all of us. Very strong bond.<br>
<br>
T+ 2:00 - Head to a big night club, get some special tickets which allow us to jump the que and get a free drink. Awesome. I'm not buzzing quite as hard now, in fact feeling slightly drunk. However I still feel awesome and very content and blissful. Smoke a cig and head into the club.<br>
<br>
T+2:10 - Order a drink with friends, the lights and music are truly amazing. Bass is thumping through me, lights playing with my brain, beautiful. They were playing mainly hip hop/r&b, would of been better with some trance/dance, but none the less can't wait to get dancing! Drink my drink, chat a bit more. Jaw clenching. Firsts thing first, off to the bathroom for another line.<br>
<br>
T+2:15 The line was fat. My nose is now burning. My head is now rushing. Feeling sweaty<br>
<br>
T+2:17 - Run back downstairs, the place is packed. Smile and say hello to anybody and everybody. Feel connected with every soul in the place. Find my friends, tell them how fucking awesome I feel. Two of them go for another line. Meet up with some more friends, see some other people I know, put my arm around them and we all glide off onto the dance floor... Ohhhhhhh yeah!<br>
<br>
T+2:25 - The last line hit me. I am rushing. Whole body buzzing, legs feel light. Lights flickering, eyes wobbling everything is beautiful. I must have looked like the guy from The Streets - Blinded By The Lights track. Reach my hands up for the roof, rub my face and neck, jaw clenching and grinding, caught in the moment of one of the best feelings ever.<br>
<br>
T+ 2:30 - The rest of my friends join me on the dance floor. We are all united as one, dancing, moving. The two friends that had also been doing Mephedrone tell me how amazing they feel. I will keep her name anonymous, but this girl is noticeably fucked, eyes like dinner plates. She tells me shes done quite a few lines. She tells me how amazing I am, we go off for a deep chat and compliment each other, bonding like never before, she is also gurning and grinding her jaw. Her boyfriend was a little un-easy about our level of connectivity.<br>
<br>
T+3:00 - More dancing. no more booze for me, only water. Can't focus very well. Eyes wobbling.<br>
<br>
T+ Unknown - Possibly another line, can't remember. Body rushing everywhere, legs feel weird, get some attention from bouncers and nearly get kicked out. Some friends sit me down. Sweating. Everything is rushing.<br>
<br>
T+ Unknown - Can't stay still any longer, go for another dance. Go for a cig, chat to some randoms.<br>
<br>
T - Unknown - wonder off on my own, chat to random people. Mouth tastes pretty nasty, a mixture of cigs, booze, and Mephedrone. Can't find my chewing gum.<br>
<br>
T - Unknown - Meet everyone, exit the club. Feel myself coming down a bit, very relaxed. Get a taxi back to the town with everybody. Stop off at a petrol station and get some gum. Though hazy relaxed eyes I felt a smile on my face as I made eye contact with the nice looking lady behind the desk. I look into her deep brown eyes, there was a glint in them, it was like looking into a beautiful endless void. She smiled back. Felt a warm wave go through my chest, broke eye contact as we exchanged items of money and gum. look back into her deep eyes as I put my gum in my pocket. She was still smiling, a connection had been made. A thought flew through my mind at a split second 'Perhaps she could be a future girlfriend, perhaps I will never see her again'<br>
<br>
Wanted to stay and get to know her but didn't want to keep the taxi driver waiting. Said bye, walked back to the taxi, go back to a mates house, sit and talk for hours.<br>
<br>
All in all, a good night. Sorry for the dodgy time scale, half of the night is from memory. Mephedrone is far too more-ish. Its addictive, the urge to re-dose was always there. I think I need to stop sniffing it and start bombing it. However I felt absolutely awesome. It did take me awhile to get to sleep, I woke up feeling OK with a slight hangover but nothing too severe.<br>
<br>
Recently I have been having increasingly bad come downs that leave me physically and emotionally drained for days, so I might have a break from it for a few months.<!-- End Body -->
