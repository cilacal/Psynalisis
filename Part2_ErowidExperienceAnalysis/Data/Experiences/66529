Of all the substances I have known, alcohol has been my worst. I have Asperger's Syndrome and am prone to depression, in retrospect I can see how these combined with alcohol led me down a dark path.<br>
<br>
I started drinking when I was about 14 years old, that's fairly typical in my country, I didn't drink for any other reason than the fact that it's the done thing. I would go out with my friends on Friday night, get smashed and repeat every week ad nauseum. I would always end up feeling very introspective, isolated and frustrated. I never thought about this too much, as I was still living with my parents so my life was fairly stable and drinking wasn't a regular thing, I just thought that social life was like that. I went to Uni at the age of 18 to 21, I was taking alot of E then and didn't drink very much, but times they change.<br>
<br>
After leaving Uni I ended up feeling very lost in the world, I felt like I didn't belong with everyone else, society made no sense to me and I felt powerless to control my own path, however, I could forget all my worries with a beer. A few beers and my mind slowed down, I could engage with people in a cheery, asinine way and that felt good. I was just like everyone else. I would now go out and drink a few times a week, and have a couple of beers after work. Simple. I met my current partner who would share my cheap cider and life was straight-forward, work a shitty job then come home and get a bit booze in me.<br>
<br>
Then I lost my job. Then another. And another. I wasn't pursuing my art anymore either. I wasn't doing anything with my days. So to fill in the gaps where my life should've been, I'd have a beer. I'd have a few beers. Then my girlfriend would come home and we'd go to the pub. It's what you do, and anyway, isn't drinking loads an amusing trait?<br>
<br>
The seams started to tear very quickly, the gaps of soberness started to get smaller and smaller, if I was bored, I'd have a beer, if I was frustrated with life, a beer. Depressed? beer. Party? beer. Had to leave the house at all? beer. I would wake up and finish last nights' 8% beer, then go and buy the cheapest, strongest booze I could afford.<br>
<br>
I completely lost myself in the drink. I would spend months at a time without ever really sobering up, my nerves were totally shot, my mind didn't work anymore, I could feel the world moving away from me as tried to drink myself to oblivion to dull the horror I was creating for myself. In Frat films the heavy drinker is the fun party guy, I became his nemesis. I was increasingly aggressive, always trying to start fights, I treated my girlfriend despicably, after all, I didn't care about myself so how could I care about anyone else? My stomach started to rot. My girlfriend would cry alot, my best friends didn't know who I was anymore. I wasn't a person anymore. I was a violent storm of self-destruction with no conscience.<br>
<br>
It's now been 18 months since I had a drink. I was fortunate in that the people closest to me had the moral fibre to wait for me to wake up. I don't think I'll ever escape from alcohol's shadow, the urge to drink grabs me when I least expect it. I'm not afraid to tell people I've had a problem, it's who I am now that counts. I also hope that my open approach might encourage others who feel they need help to ask for it. I believe that because alcohol is so interwoven in our societal structure, it can easily hide its negative side from scrutiny.<br>
<br>
Are weekend binge drinkers really so far from where I was?<br>
It's just a question of regularity.<!-- End Body -->
