I hesitated to report this experience at first, as it was a mistake caused by my lack of attention to exactly what I had been doing all day.  For me it was both a very interesting and strong trip, approaching what I've read from many ayahuasca reports, as well as a cautionary tale.  I had recently<br/>
(about 8 days prior) discontinued a 40mg daily dose of Celexa, and I believe this may have contributed something to the intensity of the experience.  <br/>
<br/>
Last year, I had acquired a small amount of 3,5-dimethoxy-4-propyloxyamphetamine (3C-P).  This chemical was not listed in PiHKAL, or any other literature I could find for that matter.  After discussing it with a psychedelics forum I frequent, I decided to do a run up on it starting at 200mcg or so in order to determine activity.   I had made it up to an 8mg dose on the day this report took place.  I took it up to 20mg or so before running out of material / losing interest, at which level it was a +1.  Others have since continued workup of this material to higher levels, but I will leave it to those individuals to post their reports as they see fit.  <br/>
<br/>
10:00AM - Woke up and ingested 8mg of 3C-P.  After about an hour I noticed a very slight stimulation and very slight color enhancement, but nothing that I would consider to be a +1.   I proceeded about on my daily tasks, mostly getting ready for a musical festival that was to be held that night.  <br/>
<br/>
4:00PM - The 3C-P had apparently either worn off or the effects were so small in the first place that I had completely become used to them to the point where I had forgotten that I took it.  This is what I now refer to as Mistake #1.  During the next couple of hours I ingested a few beers and listened to the music.  <br/>
<br/>
6:00PM - The 2C-T-2 I had brought with seemed to be appropriate at this point.  A crowd had gathered, and I didn't want to drink myself silly.   2C-T-2 generally takes about 45 minutes to an hour to make its effects known to me, and this brings us to Mistake #2: <br/>
<br/>
6:30PM - A conversation I was having with someone prompted them to ask me if I was planning on partaking of any substances that night.   I told him about the 2C-T-2 I had taken.  He had heard of it before, and was very interested in trying it, so I told him he could have some if he wanted.  In return, he gave me a very large mushroom, about 1g.  This was a combination that I had done before, although with about .25g of mushrooms instead.  <br/>
<br/>
7:00PM - The mushroom and the 2C-T-2 begin kicking in at the same time.  This is when some pathway in my brain decided to reconnect itself, and remind me that I had also eaten 3C-P this morning.  I didn't think it would be much of a problem, as all doses were fairly small.  This was mistake #3.  <br/>
<br/>
7:30PM - Visuals had already progressed to the point where I couldn't see very much, if at all, in low light.  Had I known what was going to happen next, I would have found some Xanax and a quiet room to lock myself in as soon as possible.   I had just enough time to warn the people that I had come with about what I had done.  I informed them that I was in no medical danger, but there was going to be quite a bit of a chance of me losing it in weird and interesting ways.  <br/>
<br/>
-time stops here-<br/>
<br/>
At some point, I became aware that whatever was happening to me, it was the chance to become one with eternity, and become a god.   In order to do this, as would be revealed to me in increments, I would first have to experience the eternal struggle and balance of all opposites.  Of course, in order to do this I would have to remove my clothes.  I have added the story of what was really going on as pieced together from the testomonials of many of the fifty or so people that were there who have taken the time to yell 'Hey, you're that naked guy' when they see me on campus, and relate events to me. <br/>
<br/>
What I remember: <br/>
During a large period of the night, I relived the best and worst moments of what seemed like every human life dating back hundreds of years. Each moment lasted only, well, a moment, but could be felt and seen clearly.  I would cycle between the greatest ecstasy I have felt for just a split second, and suddenly the worst pain or sadness.  The intensity on each life was different, relative to what event was experienced.  <br/>
<br/>
In one life, I could be doing something such as laying under a tree as a child, watching the clouds, as the good moment.  Next I would be suddenly in a freezing trench in an unknown war, horribly wounded and dying.  One moment a woman on her wedding night, the next being raped by police officers.  Gender was no issue, and although many of the worst moments included death, this was certainly not the most common, or the worst, as those with death involved would end in what seemed like less time.   <br/>
<br/>
After going through all of this for what seemed like a very long time, I came to the conclusion that there was a required moment of pain for every moment of ecstasy, although, say, I moment of mild joy would only require a mild sadness to cancel out.  It was not all exact opposites, although this was all I was being shown.  With this realization, the next phase of the trip started.  <br/>
<br/>
I was able to see normal reality again, and realized that I was naked, although not that there was any sort of problem with this, which there really wasn't:  the only reason anyone cared about me running around naked was that it was getting really cold out, and I was starting to look a bit pale.  <br/>
<br/>
A wonderful girl that I hadn't met before decided that she would help me with this.  Nobody could get me to put the pants I brought with back on, so she asked me what I wanted to wear.  Apparently I told her that I needed a kilt and bullhorns, but I was brought a skirt and my shirt & jacket instead.   She brought me in the house and made me get dressed.  I was taught a song to keep singing when I forgot that I required clothes... 'Got to keep your clothes on' with a little tune.  I could still sing it right now if I wanted to, even though I don't remember learning it. <br/>
<br/>
In any case, I went outside singing this loudly to the cheers of everyone, who had now focused their attention on my antics almost more than the music.  At this point, the idea had somehow got into my head that these people were the ones who would someday evolve into gods, and I was gaining the opportunity to join them.  (in reality it was a large mix of hippies, ravers, and plain old drugheads) In order to join the future godhood, I would be required to absolutely perfect the song I was singing about keeping my clothes on, as well as a dance to go with it, a new artform, etc...   This part is fairly foggy and repetitive.  At one point the band was playing and just letting me sing.<br/>
<br/>
At some point it became clear to me that although I had all eternity to practice my song, I would spend the same amount of time I spent perfecting it in hell.  Then, suddenly, my visuals almost completely stopped.   The faces of the people there returned to normal, and they became recognizable again.   I went and sat down, remembering only what was posted above.  I still think about this trip, and although several meanings and realizations are obvious from the above, almost none have been in any way applicable to normal life.   It was too much information in too little time, at least for my brain.   <br/>
<br/>
The story of events: <br/>
After warning them of my impending insanity, my friends kept some sort of eye on me for awhile.   After I threw my clothes off, one of them chased me down and tried to get me to put them back on, which I did for a few seconds.  As soon as he walked away they went back off again.  Eventually everyone realized that I wasn't intent on harming myself or anyone else, and just allowed me to run around naked until it got gold.  One of my friends gave me a hug at some point, and my response to him was 'We have achieved god consciousness.'  At some point, I apparently got up on stage and yelled 'I am god, and you're all going to die' into the microphone.  Soon after I was crowdsurfing naked.  At one point, I ran into the cornfields, probably to urinate.  Afterwards, I sat down.  Someone came after me, and I was standing there with them, completely naked, when the cops showed up.  <br/>
<br/>
They must REALLY have not wanted to deal with me, because they just shone a flashlight on us and walked on.  After my clothes made it back on, things went pretty much as above, although I was apparently yelling some weird, random things.  <br/>
<br/>
Without the help of about 20 good friends looking after me, as well as friendly strangers, I most likely would have been injured or worse after this night.   These experimental psychedelics aren't toys, and even with fairly low doses of everything involved, I was still in a state where I wasn't in control of my actions anymore and things could have gone downhill very fast.  It was too intense to get anything useful out of, and certainly wasn't 'fun' in any sense of the word.   Use caution.<!-- End Body -->
