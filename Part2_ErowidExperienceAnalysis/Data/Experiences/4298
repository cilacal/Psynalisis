My fiance and I were planning on trying a new substance that I have had been saving for the right time it was 2c-t-2 in powder form. I am 195lb male and she, who I will refer to as K, is a 110lb female.<BR>
<BR>
It was a wet and windy night, we had a nice fire going, and things seemed perfect for this trip. I have done a lot of research on this compound and 8mg seemed like a nice, non-threatining level to start with. I had tried 2ct7, which is supposed to be similiar to 2c-t-2, at 5mg intranasally and figured this would probably be less intense than that experience, which I found very enjoyable. We had eaten about 4 hrs. prior to ingesting.<BR>
<BR>
5:50pm- Down the hatch 8mg 2c-t-2 in gel caps for both of us.<BR>
<BR>
6:15- I am feeling a slight warm flushing throughout my head and body, K says she feels nothing and is keeping herself busy cleaning while the drug comes on.<BR>
<BR>
7:00- We are both starting to feel definite effects. K says she is feeling some definite nausea. I am not. Colors are enhanced and the christmas tree lights have taken on a blurry look. I say it probably won't get much stronger than this, since we are probably at a +1 at this time. Other reports have said anything below 12mgs won't give you more than a +1 with this substance.<BR>
<BR>
7:15- K is still nauseaus so she tries smoking a little pot. I am <BR>
not feeling any discomfort.<BR>
<BR>
7:30- K says smoking eliminated nausea and she feels much better. She goes outside to her car to get cd's. She says that being outside in the rain was amazing! I walk outside to check it out and agree that it is very nice and exhilirating. The effects are definitely starting to intensify.<BR>
<BR>
7:45- Full on effects. Very good feeling throughout the body. Feels alot like MDMA, but not as empathetic. This is alot stronger than I was expecting from 8mg! We are both at a solid +2.<BR>
<BR>
8:00- Decide to listen to some music and explore our surroundings a bit. Music sounds great, both of us enjoy taking turns playing different stuff. This music appreciation is similiar to MDMA as well. When I walk into the brightly lit kitchen I notice everything is washed with a pinkish tinge. Very nice!<BR>
<BR>
9:30- The peak is over and we are still in a good place, but, more grounded. Probably coming back down to reality soon.<BR>
<BR>
10:00- Definitely coming down. K smokes more pot, I decline. My stomach is starting to percolate and churn a bit. K has no stomach discomfort at all (maybe the pot?). I also feel hungry at the same time.<BR>
<BR>
10:30- We both decide to eat. This helped my stomach condition alot. We are not totally down but very close to it.<BR>
<BR>
12:00- Both of us are feeling a little washed out. It's not nearly as bad as an MDMA come down can feel, but, your body definately feels like it's been through a fairly intense experience. We decide to go to bed.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
Aftermath:<BR>
<BR>
We both fell asleep right away and slept solidly until 9:00 am. Both of us felt well rested with no hangover symptoms at all. I would like to note that we both experienced slight headaches towards the end of the trip, but, nothing serious. We would definately try 2c-t-2 again maybe at 12mg, but, definitely not higher. I wonder if this is just a strong batch of material or we are both sensitive to this compound. As I stated earlier we both achieved a solid +2 from just 8mg. All in all a very good first experience!<!-- End Body -->
