Well it is Columbus Day and today was catch-up day. You know, cleaning, projects and all that other stuff you never seem to have time to do besides on a vacation. I had previously done one or two Adderall (I assume 10-20 mg), sometimes with herb, and without the herb I did not experience much effect. I do not have ADHD and usually do not have much trouble concentrating either. I acquired these from a friend who is prescribed four a day, but usually only takes one. After cleaning my bedroom a while, I figured what the hell, I might as well have some fun doing chores, and decided to take two of the four around 11:30 or 12 noon.<BR>
<BR>
Decided to check some e-mails, and soon found myself concentrating very much on deleting junk mail from the inbox. So it seemed my thinking was a bit more focused, as before, but still nothing special. Around 1 pm or 1:20 I decided to take the other two just to see how far it would take me. After a bit of cleaning, I found my family upstairs eating lunch without me. I decided to join them but only had a pack of raisins. I do not know if this is common with Adderall, but I was not very hungry, despite not having any breakfast. Instead of eating I found myself reading the paper and I couldn't stop. And I was reading sections I do not usually read and mean almost nothing to me, such as the Business Equipment section of the Classifieds. I would have read more but decided I really wasn’t getting anything done. Then my brother mentions the movie 'Training Day' and I found that it was very easy to recall the movie and explain the plot to my mother, which is strange because I saw it maybe February or March this year, and I cannot usually remember movies that I had watched drunk and late at night with such detail.<BR>
<BR>
There were no other drugs involved this day except Adderall, and it was taken orally. As far as physical effects I felt a mild but satisfying high about 30-45 minutes after taking the last two. After a while I noticed that if I scratched my head I could feel my hair but the back and top of my head was comfortably numb. To a lesser extent I found that my body was also a bit numb and tingly. Later on in the day I noticed some gas. Not too much but a very specific odor. I could also recall that it was more or less the same as last time I took the stuff.<BR>
<BR>
Also later on as I was diligently scrubbing a stain out of my car without warning my bladder felt overfilled and I had to piss like a race horse. This must have happened at least four times in the course of the day. A bit of dry mouth too, but nothing compared to herb. I was very awake and happy the entire day, and it was easy to talk to everyone. Now I have this feeling in my head at 1 am the next day not like a headache but a feeling that my brain has been through a lot today, without actually feeling tired. When it was finally time to eat dinner, the hunger seemed to overpower the drugs and I couldn’t get enough spaghetti and meatballs. Those are all the physical effects I can easily recall. <BR>
<BR>
All in all I cleaned my room, deleted a bunch of e-mail, read too much of the newspaper, closed up my pool for the winter, washed the windows on my car, vacuumed and scrubbed the car upholstery, took off the hubcaps, washed some bearing grease off my AC compressor, moved my 12 ft. boat away for the winter, did some math and physics, and a few other mundane tasks, which did not seem nearly as mundane to me as it probably seems to you. <BR>
<BR>
From this experience I learned that a dose of 10 or 20 mg is essentially useless as far as a high is concerned, while 40 mg lets me think clearly and feel good at the same time. Next time I might try five or six pills. I also learned that if I get sidetracked from my task it is very easy to become absorbed in that side project. The good high effects probably lasted three or four hours max, but the ability to easily focus is still somewhat present more than 12 hours later. I feel like I did not get nearly enough done. Next time I will be sure to devote some of my Adderall time to making a list of things to do for the next ten or so hours, and stick to that list.<!-- End Body -->
