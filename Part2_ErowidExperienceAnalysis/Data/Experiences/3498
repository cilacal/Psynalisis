9:55  Drop… lit some incense and a candle, turned on some live Pearl Jam<br/>
<br/>
10:15 shower, notice some trails a bit, skin doesn’t feel like its mine, fingers don’t want to type,  shampooing feels great, opening and closing my eyes<br/>
<br/>
10:30 out of shower, very hard to type, thinking deep but then shifting to something else, everything looks great, some visuals, weird ones, headache pretty much gone, lack of sleep, slight ache in right wrist, probably from typing<br/>
<br/>
10:45 put on some Doors Concerto, hard to focus on this damn screen, wanna turn on my trippy screen saver….  E, I crawl out of my hands, this makes me crawl out of  my feet…  fun so far, no complaints, slight body load, but nothing I can’t handle<br/>
<br/>
stuff makes me want things simple, had a strange phone call, dealt with it well, thank god its over<br/>
<br/>
closing all my windows, they are bothering me…<br/>
<br/>
after two minutes, not gonna happen now, must be climbing or something<br/>
<br/>
Doors didn’t cut it, Zep didn’t cut it, however Pink Floyd’s Piper at the Gates of Dawn hit the spot very well.  Just had a phone conversation with D who will be visiting this weekend, and I’m sure I’ll share this with him.  He wants some white, but this is better by far… just washed my hands, not a cooling effect like E, still crawling out of my hands and feet<br/>
<br/>
It’s  11:00PM, time for the bars, gonna take a whack of some good kind bud, best I had all year, wanted to ride this out a little better, but its cool<br/>
<br/>
Two whacks of weed, and I think I’m good… this stuff might have induced a slight cold/cough in me.  Not really coughing much till post T.  caughing before pot, that is why I want to mention it, not pot induced.  Floyd is really sounding good by the way…<br/>
<br/>
11:00 – Midnight… hung at the bar, $1.50 pitchers… Only drank one pitcher…  The hottie waitress smelled like a million bucks… Every time she walked by, chills, thrills, and hoping for drink spills all over me…  No luck, she was not in as bad of shape as I was…  Watching the Yankees win their 3rd game gave me chills like E.  It was actually cool to watch a good baseball game, something I couldn’t give a rats ass about normal.<br/>
<br/>
12:15-1:15, went to Zeno’s for some good beer…  Also to look for some friends, desiring companionship, male or female, of course females make me feel  so much better :) Ran into an old friend in route, talked with him for 15 minutes or so…  Ptetty coo, tried to maintain my composure.  Wanted to see if that was possible, it wasn’t hard, but not sure how bad or fucked up I looked or acted… couldn’t analyze<br/>
<br/>
1:15-2:15, went back to the Brewerey, wanted to look at hot women, not many thaere, and not enough gonads to actually talk to any… but I had fun.  Just hung out, didn’t make a puddle out of myself as I do on E… just relaxed, really, really enjoyed my Yuengling Lager with a Lemon slice….  So good, and I’m born in Pottsville too, so don’t think I’m a Sally.<br/>
<br/>
2:30, I’m home, left the candles and oil lamp burning, what the frick, I’m the smartest guy I know…  Listening to some ol’ Floyd again, and now put the Smashing Pumpkins in… Fuck, amazing… Need a show to quench this urge… <br/>
<br/>
It’s 3:30, I’m still going strong… My overall opininon of this is that it is a direct cross between E and everything good about a nice trip on Mushrooms or some not so strong acid.  Mushrooms and Acid have caused me very bad trips in the past… Mainly due to a bad environment, but one time, from just way too many shrooms.  It sucked, made an ass out of myself, but everyone was cool about it, even found a girlfriend after all was said and done… <br/>
<br/>
Anywho, enough about that, this shit rocks…  I’m making a vow not to mix this with E until a female is present who knows shes gonna get a good talking to in more ways than 1 :-)<br/>
<br/>
OK, well, Peace!<br/>
