Well for a little background, I have used many different sorts of psychedellics, ranging from the typical LSD experience to less known compounds such as 5-MeO-DiPT.<BR>
<BR>
8:30p.m<BR>
<BR>
I started by weighing out about 25 mg of 2C-T-7 that I had procurred.  I proceeded to fill a capsule with the said quantity.<BR>
<BR>
T 1.00<BR>
I decided that I was wasting my time with this substance and called a friend to come and try some with me.<BR>
<BR>
T 2.30<BR>
Friend arrives and we weigh out his 25mg and another 25mg for myself.<BR>
<BR>
T 2.45<BR>
We head downstairs and pop in Aphex Twin's 'Windowlicker'video.<BR>
<BR>
T 3.30<BR>
Sweet Jesus! My body feels like I'm on E!  Still no visuals but my hopes have risen.<BR>
<BR>
T 4.00<BR>
Starting to see the ceiling spiral, and I am beginning to see small fractalish patterens in my friends pants.  He isn't feeling much, I head to my room to get him more.  It is very difficult to measure the stuff out, for my vision is clouded by the amazing colourful visuals.<BR>
<BR>
T 6.00 <BR>
The other pill that I filled for myself must have kicked in. I can't move.  Everything is so beautiful, I don't think that it's possible to have a bad trip on this stuff.<BR>
<BR>
T 8.00<BR>
My friend suggests a walk, I am still on the couch, haven't moved for two hours.  But it sounds good.  We head outside and take a mile walk to a nearby meadow.  The lightning bugs are amazing.  We run around in the meadow for a bit and I collapsed on to the grass.  I suddenly realise that the stars are out! I tell my friend to come and lie down also. He is a little bit less out of it than I am, he tells me that I am in wet grass clippings.<BR>
<BR>
T 8.30 <BR>
We head back to the house but we decide that it is rather far away and stop and lay down on the country road. (We can tell if there are cars coming, if the road were ever travelled then it would be a problem.. ) The warmth of the road contrasts the coolness of the air... It is very nice.<BR>
<BR>
T 9.30<BR>
We realise that we are still in the road and get up and make our way back to the house.  Before we get there a car pulls up and scares us very badly, it was only some aquaintances of ours. *While on any other strong hallucinogen this would have turned the trip into a very negative direction, yet on the 2C-T-7 we still were very happy and free*<BR>
<BR>
T 9.45<BR>
Finally we are back to the house, I decide that I am tired and want to sleep, yet my friend is getting his second coming with the second pill. <BR>
<BR>
This substance definately proves to be one of, if not the best psychedelic in my eyes, period.  I had the visuals of LSD, 'shrooms, DMT, and the good tactile sensations of E, or 5-MeO-DiPT.  2C-T-7 is definately worth trying.<!-- End Body -->
