I've always been a fan of hallucinogens. They really provide the overall best experience of any type of drug. And each one seems to be infinitely different from the others. This night, I wanted to try a few at the same time. And I wanted to do it right.<BR>
<BR>
I kicked it off by eating the 1/8 ounce of dried psilocybin mushrooms. Never really cared for the taste of the things, but it's bearable. Once I got those taken care of, I ate a gelcap, with about 12mg of Foxy. It was powder, with a slight blue color. I ate them within 5 minutes of each other.<BR>
<BR>
My friends and I were camping out in the woods, under a mysterious wooden gazebo that looked like it hadn't seen humans in years. It was kind of eerie. But a very nice location.<BR>
<BR>
The drugs began to take hold after about a half hour, and if I had to guess I'd say the mushrooms came on first. Foxy tends to give me gas, and I wasn't getting this feeling. I just sat for another 20 minutes, enjoying the onset of mushrooms.<BR>
<BR>
The head trip started first. I started getting feelings of extreme happiness, and felt really genuinely glad that I was in this place with these people. It all felt so right. Almost the same feeling I get with good ecstasy. As I looked up at a sky full of stars, I felt like nothing could go wrong. And, unusually, my mind was otherwise clear. I felt like I was meditating.<BR>
<BR>
I ate another 12mg of foxy as rain clouds rolled in. It had been an hour and a half since the shrooms, and visuals were getting very pronounced. I stared at an old wood beam next to me, and watched as the knots and lichen first began breathing, then moving around each other on the beam. The bright green of the lichen glowed intensely in the dim firelight, and these patches seemed to grow and engulf the knots around them. I was absolutely amazed.<BR>
<BR>
It began to rain, and I watched, giggling uncontrollably, as two of my friends (also on mushrooms) tried to fashion a rain cover for the hole in the center of the gazebo, where water was getting in and putting out our fire. They finally got it figured out, after much fumbling and argument on how it should be done. It was all in good spirits.<BR>
<BR>
I was still mesmerized by the lichen. All the colors around me were incredibly intense, but this was the most noticeable. I needed to find more lichen! I stood up, suddenly, after sitting for more than 2 hours. I felt more than a little disoriented, and after a few seconds got a massive headrush and had to sit back down. There was much laughter. I gave it a second try, with more success. I proclaimed I had to take a piss and set out alone into the darkness.<BR>
<BR>
Once I got away from the light of the fire, I realized that the moon was shining through the rain clouds. It cast a very mellow glow on the woods. I felt like a kid in a candy store. I didn't even notice the rain, which was coming down pretty hard at this point. As I took an establishing look around me, I noticed my face hurt from smiling. This always seems to happen to me on 'shrooms!<BR>
<BR>
Once I got over the initial excitement, I remembered why I was there, and set out to find some lichen. The rain was causing some serious audio hallucinations, echoing and bouncing all around me. I found a small tent platform, which hadn't been used in a while. It was covered in my newfound green friend! I sat down on the platform, and stayed there for a long time. Time was very distorted, so I have no idea how long. The tent platform began to look like a disco floor, and the rain started sounding like music. I started swaying to the imaginary beat, and thought again about how lucky we were to find this place.<BR>
<BR>
Tripping people usually like to stay in groups, and when someone disappears for a long time, people start getting worried about them. I was perfectly content sitting on my platform, and got a little annoyed when people found me. I want to get a bad vibe going, so I didn't say anything.<BR>
<BR>
The night went on like this, until dawn. I was tripping all the way through, for a total of around 9 hours. It was one of the most fun times I've ever had.<BR>
<BR>
The major difference I noticed between this and straight mushrooms was the happiness. Foxy seems to add an ecstacy-like feeling to the trip, making mundane things seem much more important. Alone, Foxy is mild and doesn't give good visuals. Combined with mushrooms, it's one hell of a ride!<!-- End Body -->
