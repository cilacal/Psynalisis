Before I begin start on my experience let me first tell you that I, myself am 110% complete pothead. This was the second time that I did alpha-0, this time was no where close to as intense as my first but back to the trip.<br>
<br>
(12:00pm-6:59pm)- constant dank smokage.<br>
<br>
(7:03pm) at this time I consumed the 17 and a half milligrams of alpha-0 which I did by oral ingestion.<br>
<br>
(7:24pm) I took my first 4 shots of vodaka. I remember the taste of it made my almost puke. I have a weak point when drinking straight clear liquor, drank it alot in my early days and ever since it has been very hard even to smell it. I went to go smoke a cigarette and when I returned I had gotten enough will power to take the other 3 shots.<br>
<br>
(7:30) The weedman got to my boys house to drop us off a little package with 2 ounces of some good weed in it. Right away we went back in and started breaking it down and rolling blunts.<br>
<br>
(8:00)  Since I was the one with the best twisting ability so I got to roll the gigantic 7 gram, double blunt leave blunt. It was beautiful, it was 9 inches long and about the fatness of a regular tobacco blunt.<br>
<br>
(8:20pm) spark the blunt.<br>
<br>
(8:27pm) I start to feel a bit getty like I do when an acid trip is coming on, but also I was very relaxed since I was high as shit and feeling pretty good from the shots.<br>
<br>
(8:45pm) still smoking the blunt.<br>
<br>
(9:27pm) the blunt finally was done. By this time I could see visuals starting to come on. Things are moving slightly, I know this feeling. Not to mention, after that blunt I didn't want to walk, to much effort.<br>
<br>
(9:42pm) I leave with a good friend to go pick up the snow. We had been planning for a week or so for each of us to get a gram and do it.<br>
<br>
(9:59pm) A. gets in the car and sells us the yay. While the transaction was going on he offered me a zantex bar for free, and its were talking about here and I cant say no to free drugs. So I got a cd case and crushed up the bar and snorted it in 2 lines.<br>
<br>
(10:26pm) We get back to the house and head straight for the bathroom to start busting out lines. The reason for going to the bathroom is the house was filled with wasted fiends, we just can't start busting lines out in front of them, so many people will crowd, it's just annoying. So we always just go to the bathroom and lock the door. While we were busting out our lines I took a minute to look up and notice things, I was so frantic before and in to getting business done that I forgot to start enjoying my trip.<br>
<br>
As I looked around it was quite apparent that I was tripping, the lights had that bright mystic glow they get to them, kind of like when I'm rolling, things were moving all over the place. I then tried to move and it was as if I was glued to the counter, the Z. bar had hit me like a freight train, I was still feeling awesome from the liquor and I was also still high as shit. The lines were busted out. I get a sudden shot euphoria as I lean down to take the line. Great blow, excellent. See I don't like to do coke if it isn't fire. It has to be fire. This is because I was once heavy into meth, and it's hard to go back to coke when meth is a trillion times more potent and gives me alot harder of a speed burst. We went ahead and got a cd case and put the rest of the first gram into lines and put it under the sink.<br>
<br>
(10:40pm-12:00am) blunt...then line...blunt...line... (etc)<br>
<br>
(12:01am) by this time I'm peaking on the alpha 0. I'm blown out, I'm high as fuck, still feeling the shots, the bar still going strong. When I look at things the move, lights glow, the sky has constant little white dots almost like static, I'm energetic in my mind but when I go to move I don't get far from the weed, alcohol and Z. bar. Extreme body effects, almost like I'm floating. I close my eyes and I'm instantly taken away from the present and put into the clouds. Just for a moment though, keep them closed too long and my head will start to spin a bit too much and I'd be headed for the toilet.<br>
<br>
(12:00am-5:00am) basically I stayed peaked on the alpha 0 and kept on smoking and doing lines throughout the night, until the yay was gone(4:48am). <br>
<br>
(5:01am) I am finally starting to come down off the alpha 0. I was in a completely relaxed mood, just chillen in the living room talking to 8 of my good friends, or at least 5 were still up. Connor, he was the first to pass out at 12:30, he drank mad beer and did 3 zantex bars, so he when he was out....he was OUT! I sat there, retarted and just talked calmly, smoked a few more times and just kind of reflected on my wild night of drugs, one of too many sadly.<br>
<br>
(7:45am) I finally pass out and slept the entire day, night, and some of the next day(I didn't go to sleep Saturday night, and Sunday was the night of the trip) I woke on Monday at 11:22am. The first thing I said was what the fuck happened.<br>
<br>
I still see those damn static dots when I look in a blue sky in the day from my first time on it, a week prior. One more thing I want to add about my first time tripping on 5-Me0-AMT is every 5 minutes or so I would roll/pop my neck and it was an extreme methy feeling throughout the entire trip, but especially when I did that. I did it because I would get chills up my spine like it was crooked, very methy feelings, very strange, which also why it made it such an odd one a kind trips. Almost like if I were to take 3 hits of some good acid and do good sized 2 lines of meth. Or, also like the title says Mushroom Crack. That name we got for it the first time we all tripped one it that day. When we were all really starting to feel it and it was kicking all our asses we called Matt, he knows alot about drugs, we described what we were on and you know what he said? He just laughed and said that sounds like you got some mushroom crack son, god damn, fucking stupid. He then hung up. There was a bit of panic at that point but everything worked out.<!-- End Body -->
