I am in law school and recently had the opportunity to procure some Adderall XR 25MG capsules through a connection.  The following is my account of what happened.  I have attempted to edit any descrepencies in time.  I am submitting this as an adderall only report, but I also had 1MG of xanax, 2MG of flexoril, some marijuana, and alcohol in my system.  I do not feel that these had any bearing on my adderall experience but I am nonethless including them.<br>
<br>
T 0:00<br>
<br>
I pop a 25 mg Adderall XR, time is 1:10pm and I have just woke up after a full night's sleep.  I am planning a full day of studying for one, possibly two exams.  I am normally a caffeine addict, normally drinking three or four glasses of mountain dew (approx 48 ounces) per day as well as two or three large coffees.  Based on my experiences in the past, I don't expect much from this in terms of energy since I am mostly immune to stimulants, except cocaine and the heavier stuff.  Adderall is an amphetamine, so we shall see.<br>
<br>
T + :30 - I'm not sure if I feel an initial rush as the Adderall kicks in, but there is a change, whether placebo or chemical. Initially it's somewhat hard to concentrate, but after 10 to 15 minutes my body appears to adapt to the pill and I enter as somewhat halcyonic state with a slightly exaggerated state of well being.  The only way I can describe this is that it's like that experienced with cannabis except I can still function (in fact, I can function better than I can sober) and have a firm grasp of reality.<br>
<br>
T+ 1:00 - I'm feeling great now, the jitters have disappeared and I've settled into an even minded state.  I am able to concentrate on the study tasks at hand as well as menial personal tasks such as the stew I'm brewing in the crockpot.  I've managed to shut out the world outside, which is easy given the fact that I have my windows totally covered with black.<br>
<br>
T+2:30 I'm still feeling pretty well, the snow outside has lightened my mental mood and I'm energized physically to a considerable level.  I decide to venture out and run some errands and I am amazingly focused and accomplish them efficiently and decisively.<br>
<br>
T+4:00 - I'm feeling less exhuberant and 'high' than I did before.  I haven't eaten all day so I decide to eat a bowl of the stew I've made.  I'm not sure whether this will sacrifice my high or not, but perhaps I'm coming down if I'm getting hungry.<br>
<br>
T+ 5:30 - My stomach is a little upset now that I've eaten, but nothing that a little Pepto didn't cure. I attribute this to the fact that I'm normally a big eater and hadn't eaten for almost 24 hours, so my stomach has to readjust.  As for the effects of the Adderall, I feel slightly reenergized, perhaps because the hunger pains were more of a distraction.  I am now noticing that my Blood pressure and heart beat and pulse rate are accelerated and I know now why they don't prescribe adderall to people with heart problems.<br>
<br>
T + 9:00 - Hunger pains plague me again and I'm wearing down slightly.  I feel like I'm coming down from the high, but I wouldn't note anything negative per se about it except the fact that I'm slightly fatigued.  I'm going to eat again to take care of the hunger pains.  I would just like to say that this day has flown by incredibly fast.  My perception of time is the exact opposite of what I have experienced with marijuana.  It's as if the whole day has flown by in the course of an hour.<br>
<br>
T+ 10:30 - Again eating makes me feel better.  Adderall does not quell my hunger pains.  Although I grow increasingly fatigued, my focus is still fairly sharp, although noticeably faltering.  I am now considering the possibility of sleep.<br>
<br>
T+12:00 - I'm still going.  I slept relatively well the night before with the aide of my usual xanax 1MG dosage.  My concentration is now faltering and my mind starting to wander.  Judging by my normal sleep pattern I may be turning in soon.  Most notable effect is frequent urination...I've pissed small amounts every 15 minutes or so for the past few hours, whereas usually I go no more than 4 times per day.<br>
<br>
T+13:00 - I decide to pull an all-nighter and down a Red Bull.  Based on my experiences in the past, the Red Bull will give me the physical energy to sustain me through my exam.<br>
<br>
T+15:00 - It's like I'm the Energizer Bunny, I keep going and going and going...however, the Red Bull has given me physical jitters which I submit are exacerbated by an empty stomach.  I believe if I eat breakfast I will crash, so I'm considering re-upping on stimulants.  I'd like to sleep after the exam, so I'm going to avoid re-upping on the adderall.  My thoughts as of this point - WOW!  The past several hours have been rise and shine, and I'm expecting to crash and burn later today, aided by some alcohol, weed, and xanax.<br>
<br>
T+17:00 - Still going...pondering a nap, especially after the nice long shower I just took.  I drank a large (pint) glass of mountain dew and ate corn flakes for breakfast, sans sugar (figured I had that angle covered!).  I have a floating sensation going now, as if I'm floating above myself.  I'm starting to work on autopilot, and am taking breaks from studying for household tasks, which I accomplish with efficiency.<br>
<br>
T+19:00 - WoW!  Cup of coffee and I'm still floating.<br>
<br>
T+21:00 - Crashing...feeling very fatigued, having trouble retaining information...nappy time is not far away.<br>
<br>
T+23:00 - It is now 12pm, 2 hours from my exam.  I decide to crash...but I can't sleep.  I close my eyes but my body and mind is racing.  Closing my eyes helps, but after about a half hour I get up and resume my studying.<br>
<br>
T+28:00 - I meet up with some colleagues after the exam for a few bowls of some primo shrubbery and a couple of drinks.  It was probably the roughest exam of my life, and other students that I commiserate with.  I had wanted to get something to eat on the way, but I end up at a party - the weed lifted my spirits and I'm still floating.  I have a renewed energy.  I arrive early and help with preparations.  I begin to drink as soon as people arrive, but nothing heavy, some punch with Southern Comfort and Vodka, a few beers over the course of the night, and a shot as a nightcap.  I seem to 'handle my liquor' well as always, and I sober up by the end of the night...not even a buzz.<br>
<br>
T+38:00 - It's 3am, and The party winds down and I end up being the most sober of the group so I have to give everyone rides.  We stop at an all-night diner on the way and eat.  I find that I'm famished - except for small hors d'oeurves at the party I haven't eaten anything.  I choose a grilled chicken sandwich sans the fries and water.<br>
<br>
T+40:00 Hours - After smoking some more weed and a glass of wine, I'm finally back home.  I pop a Xanax and a Muscle Relaxer (*note that this is NOT a good idea since mixing alcohol with a sedative and a muscle relaxer (flexoril) can have dire consequences.  I only elected to do so because of a slight pre-existing tolerance to all three).  After another half hour of answering phone calls and reconstructing people's nights for them, I barely make it to my bed before I enter oblivion.<br>
<br>
I woke up at 2:45pm, approximately T +50 hours.  I now provide my summary of the event. I documented this partially for myself but to also share with others the effects of the drug.  I feel that this pill completely threw off my biological rhythm and my body's equilibrium.  My usual zealous appetite was missing.  In addition, I experienced some chest pains, frequent urination, and I lost 7 pounds in my sleep.  I woke up and thought that I had wet my bed, but given the absence of the distinctive smell and my subsequent marathon morning urination session, much more productive than others, I'd say that might not be true.  I've never had a problem with it, even as a child.  If I did in fact wet my bed I attribute it to the combination of drugs and stress on my body.  Today, I'm still tired, but freshly energized and sober as of the moment.  <br>
<br>
My verdict:  It was a joy ride, but not without its downside.  In retrospect a lower dosage may have been more appropriate for me.  I would not hesitate to do it again, and in fact I will use my remaining pills at a later time.<!-- End Body -->
