[Prior drug experience – Cannabis, MDMA, Hawaiian Baby Woodrose seeds]<br>
<br>
While at university, it was approaching the end of term. My friends and I tried to get hold of some MDMA for a nice night in to celebrate. Unfortunately, all our usual sources were dry, so we decided to try 2C-I instead. Some of us had taken it before, but it was the first time I had tried it. Naturally, I was a bit nervous about the whole thing, but I was definitely looking forward to it, after having done some research on it. I asked my more experienced friends a lot of questions, which helped to calm the nerves a bit.<br>
<br>
When we got the 2C-I, it came pre-weighed in gelatin capsules. We went over to my friends room, and at around 19:45, we dropped. I took 15mg, the more experienced among us took 17mg.<br>
<br>
Note: These times are the best estimations I can make based on text messages recieved/sent on the night. The passage of time was very strange, and varied from things seeming faster than normal, or much slower than normal.<br>
<br>
T = 20:15 (30 mins) - The first effects were felt. I began to feel tingles in my limbs, which seemed to slowly build up over time. I noticed mildly shaking hands, and energy starting to flow from my abdomen. As the body high became stronger, I was unsure as to how I felt about it. I seemed to vary from enjoying it to being slightly scared by it. It was similar to MDMA, but more intense, and lacking the empathogenic aspect. After a while though, I just decided to just roll with it, and try to enjoy it. The shift in my thinking seemed to help, and I started to enjoy it more. I didn't feel any nausea or discomfort.<br>
<br>
T = 21:00 (1 hour 15 minutes) - The first visuals were noticed. I was lying on my friends bed, staring at the ceiling, listening to music. It began to look like the ceiling was liquid, and it began to flow and ripple, like looking at water on glass. It was quite beautiful, and for some reason, I found it hilarious. The music seemed to be much slower than normal.<br>
<br>
After a while, I began seeing brightly coloured pattens on almost all surfaces in the room. Intricately detailed things seemed to catch my attention specifically. My friend's Monet poster looked incredible. The brush strokes moved into each other, the colours changed and patterns were evident that I hadn't seen before. The body high at this point was such that I felt like moving around a lot, so 3 of us decided to go for a walk. When we left, I was on a +2.<br>
<br>
Walking felt very pleasant – it was good to get up and move around, and I felt like I was moving in slow motion. The constant feeling of energy was fun! I wish we had gone out in the Day though. I think that a more colourful environment would have been more fun.<br>
<br>
T = 21:45 (2 hours)- We arrive at a bench in a secluded bit of woodland. My friend brought a joint with him. The cannabis seemed to act in a very synergistic manner, and boosted the visuals strongly. Really at a +3 at that point. I was sitting on a bench, looking at the trees. They were moving and waving around. The closest thing I can think of that it looked like, was seaweed moving with the waves. It was stunning. Looking at the floor produced a feeling similar to mild vertigo, but in a very acceptable and pleasurable way – watching the “Persian carpet” type patterns move and adjust was very entertaining. I tried to eat some chocolate, but the food felt foreign and strange in my mouth. Drinking water was fine, but I had to keep reminding myself to swallow.<br>
<br>
T = 22:10 (2 hours, 25 minutes) -  I had hit the peak of the experience, and plateaued, so I was at a constant +3. The walk back to my friends room was interesting. Walking down a road lined with tall buildings and trees gave me the feeling that I was much taller and thinner than I actually am. I had a couple of moments where my mind felt disconnected to my body, but as soon as I noticed this, I was able to 'get back in'. It wasn't altogether unpleasant, but a little unsettling at first. When my friends were talking, at times I wasn't sure if they were talking or if I was imagining it, so I kept asking them for reassurance that I was still sane. It was all quite funny.<br>
<br>
T = 22:30 (2 hours, 45 minutes)– Back at my friends room. I needed the toilet, so I went in and sat down (didn't want to miss!). The floor tiles are patterned, and the effect this gave was mesmerising. It felt like I was in an elevator, gently moving up and down with each inhale and exhale of breath. The floor changed colours constantly. My friends towel was also a point of interest for similar reasons. After I finished, I joined the others back in the room. I remember lying down on the bed, and wishing the visuals would stop for 5 minutes. I had strange mood swings – one moment I was laughing and happy, the next I felt sad. This persisted for around half an hour but after that, I was back into a very good mood. A Kandinsky poster looked amazing, with the geometric shapes moving around and in and out of the paper as well as changing colour. I was also transfixed by some sheet music I found.<br>
<br>
T = 00:00 (4 hours 15 minutes) – visuals wearing off a bit, but body high still large. Smoked some more cannabis, which brought back some of the more gentle visual effects. My vision was blurring intermittently, and colours were still boosted. Less movement from inanimate objects than before though. Still had nice trail effects when lights were moved.<br>
<br>
T = 00:45 (5 hours) – Open eye visuals pretty much over. Some mild boosting of colours. Closed eye visuals were still active. The body high was waning by this point.<br>
<br>
T = 01:30 (5 hours, 45 minutes) – We went back to a different friends room, and smoked more pot. By this point, I just felt stoned, rather than any residual 2C-I effects, but it was hard to tell! Stayed at my friends for around 2 hours, then went home. Sleep came easily enough.<br>
<br>
Got a good amount of sleep, and woke up feeling refreshed. The rest of the day I felt energetic, until it got dark at which point I just felt a bit tired. The day after that, as I type this, I feel completely normal.<br>
<br>
<br>
SUMMARY:<br>
<br>
Overall, the experience was positive.<br>
<br>
Not as life changing as I was expecting, but this is a chemical that I will be trying again, and I think that as I now know what to expect, I will be able to enjoy and explore the compound more. As a first experience on 2C-I, I had times where I wished I could 'switch off' the visual aspect of the drug. This typically lasted around 5 minutes, then I'd be back to my staring-in-wonderment-at-everything-and-laughing-because-I'm-tripping self. Again, I think that this will be less of a problem the next time I take it.<br>
<br>
I didn't have any major epiphanies, but did come out of the experience with a better opinion of myself. I found that touch sensations were amplified and more pleasurable than normal (though not to the extent of MDMA). Like MDMA, my temperature regulation seemed to be thrown a little, and I spent a long time with clammy hands. I tried various types of food, but whilst I was tripping, it felt alien and unpleasant to chew and swallow. The taste was unchanged. Drinking water and coke was fine, but swallowing felt slightly forced.<br>
<br>
I am now interested to try 2C-B, and see how that compares.<!-- End Body -->
