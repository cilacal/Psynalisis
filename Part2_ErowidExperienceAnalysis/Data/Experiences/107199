After a walk to the local library, my girlfriend and I decided to take the lady of a ten strip of 25i I had gotten ahold of. I had tried it before, at a music festival with little results. I think this was due to having taken it like LSD, rather than buccally.<br/>
<br/>
We both took our blotter and held it between our gums for about forty minutes. The taste was metallic and awful. It quickly numbed my mouth and made me want to gag. We decided to walk across the street to the park by our house, which looked like a miniature Central Park. The day was gorgeous! Perfect temperatures and breeze made the trees glow as they lost their leaves. My brother's wedding was in a week and I had yet to come up with a wedding present idea, but when I saw some pebbles on the ground, I decided to do stone art. My girlfriend loved the idea and went back to our apartment to get a bag to collect rocks. We walked down the street to the beach and found that the storm early in the week had washed up a bunch of shells, stones, and even sea glass. By the time my feet hit the sand, a dizzy rush came over me and my legs felt heavy. I knew this was how my trip had started last time so I ran to the public bathrooms to get that out of the way. There's nothing worse than a dark, wet, tile bathroom when you're peaking.<br/>
<br/>
We sat with our toes in the sand when I came back, watching the waves lap at the shore. The stones began to glow in front of us, and every one we picked up was more colorful and sparkly than the last. Everything was shining, and glimmering, and beautiful. We climbed the rocks to the jetties, so we faced the ocean as the waves crashed into the boulders, spraying sea mist on our faces. We both sat quietly, admiring the van Gogh art our view had turned into. Everything was a painting, the ships at sea were figures in an artist's dream. The waves pulled and pushed the energy in my body, and made me feel so art peace and cleansed.<br/>
Really, I was just awe struck and the beauty of our big, blue world. My girlfriend agreed, but climbed down, and so did I shortly after.<br/>
<br/>
We looked for more stones and found sand dollars! I remember when I lived in Florida, my mom made signs for the beach telling people to put them back because they were still alive, so we put it in salt water and carried it home. We looked up how to care for them, but learned that the one we had was already dead.<br/>
While reading the article, I found out they are called 'irregular urchins'. For some reason, we thought this was absolutely hilarious and laughed like little children.<br/>
<br/>
We went for another walk, it lasted about 2 hours of coming down, and both of our legs started to feel heavy so we made it back home again. The afterglow lasted until I woke up the next day, and even then the insane calmness I had from meditating by the waves stuck with me.<br/>
<br/>
It's funny how a man-made drug can make you fall in love with nature.<!-- End Body -->
