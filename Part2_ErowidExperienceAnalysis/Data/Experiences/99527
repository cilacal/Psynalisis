<!-- Start Body -->
Setting: In house with a trusted friend. <br>
Time: Night (9pm) <br>
Experience: LSD , DMT, Weed, DPH & DXM <br>
<br>
T: 21:00 – Both me and my friend placed a quarter of a blotter in which the whole tab contained 1200 ug uncomplexed 25I-NBOMe between my upper lip and gum. After about 1 and a half hours, I still couldn't feel much or any taste or much effects however my mouth was a tad numb.  <br>
<br>
T: +1:30 – After feeling very little my friend and I decided to take another quarter of the 1200ug tab, however it must be noted that these are different tabs and not the same one, however each tab is rated at the same ug levels. After 30 minutes some slight effects would start to transpose itself into my vision and after putting on some music it was all but too noticeable that it was doing something.<br>
<br>
T: +2:30 – Deciding that we should do one more quarter of a tab, yet again it's from a completely different tab just for reasons. Once we had taken that we proceeded to have a cone of Cannibis to add to the effect or rather relax our body high however I couldn't be further from the truth. We were outside when visuals were starting to get more and more intense, things morphing into faces and colors, we then went inside and sat on the couch to chill out. Another 30 minutes past.<br>
<br>
T: +3:00 – The cannabis seem to trigger the beginning of the visual trip. The visuals were intense, the whole room was having the noticeable breathing effect (much like LSD) as well as warping of images on the walls, doors and TV yet again much like LSD visuals but somewhat more intensified. I also noticed that while watching TV there would be static as well as more red spots over the TV and around the room which was interesting at the time. Another 30 minutes pasted. <br>
<br>
T: +3:30 – I was completely tripping. Everything was changing to multiple colors, walls had started to melt and it was very hard concentrating as well, slurred speech became apparent however it was mostly due to the numbing of my mouth and the inability to think of things to say or rapid loss of thought and memory. At this point I just wanted to leave, my heart was pounding, I began to sweat and feel sick and my body was throbbing especially my head where I was thinking about so much. My friend re assured me that it would be okay if I just relaxed a bit more, however I knew that I had reached my tolerance level, we had heard a thing that vitamin B can stop a trip so I took two tablets (However did nothing at least noticeable). I then went to the kitchen to try and control my self, my thoughts and body. I then had very bad thoughts about the drug, being so new to the market, it ran through my mind that I could have had a piece of the tab that was more then the other half or anything. I held a jumper and thought of my girlfriend to try and calm me down however the drug seemed to heighten my emotions, I was now feeling very depressed and upset that I could die and leave all of my loved ones over one stupid mistake. <br>
<br>
T: +4:00 – The trip is not showing any signs of stopping, I am continually worrying and wishing it would just stop. My friend yet again reassured me that nothing bad would happen and that it's just my anxiety attacking me, he also took the drug but is enjoying his trip and even processed to have two more cones of Cannabis. Me on the other hand just wanted to goto the emergency room just in case something was wrong. We then went to my room to relax where I felt somewhat calmer and felt as if I was coming down just a little bit, the trip was still messed up and the room was still out of its ordinary state. <br>
<br>
T: +5:00 – I had begin the come down from the tabs and was now just trying to get through the night without dieing, to me it was either life or death at this point and I had no idea what could be wrong with me and whether the trip would actually go away. <br>
<br>
T: +7:00 – My friend went to bed after making sure I was okay and then I layed in bed, my body was sore and muscles were sometimes numb in places and I felt as If I had vasoconstriction as some of my fingers, toes and even genitals was showing discoloration and no feelings, no pain no nothing. I begin to worry again.<br>
<br>
T: +11:00 – I eventually got some sleep and had just woken up, fearing that I wouldn't wake up however didn't help. But the visual effects were now gone however my body was still messed up a bit, and I feel different in the head. I have decided this would be my last trip, this brought the line closer to death then anything and I was afraid to have revelations, disorders and serious conditions which involved my heart, blood pressure and blood flow around my body. <br>
<br>
T: +20:00 – My body is still a bit worn out and my head still isn't right but I'm hoping the effects dissipate after a good nights rest. <br>
<br>
Conclusion: 25I-NBOMe was an intense experience, too intense. It might have just been me that had a bad trip, but it changed the way I think about drugs and life. I've since then quit all chemical drugs all together, although I still experience other occasional things such as DMT. I'm too scared too die, not for myself but for the people that have to deal with the loss of me, I care too much about them to continue putting my health at risk like this.<!-- End Body -->
