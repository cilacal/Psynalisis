Well, it just so happens that this particular experience is still ongoing.  Currently, I am eating vegetables, bread, and drinking lots of water.  6 hours ago was a very different story.<br>
<br>
I had decided to stay up and watch tv and surf the net.  It’s winter break, I have some papers to do, but I haven't done them.  Well, I drank one cup of coffee and I finished off the soda that I had from subway.  I think that if I hadn't had that sandwich...I would have been in much worse shape than I am now.  Anyways, I went to go get another cup of coffee, some chips and salsa, and 4 pecan delights.  I hustled those down and I didn't really feel anything.  I had another cup of coffee when my dad got up at 4.  It was crazy.  Then I had another cup of coffee at 6am with my mom.  Though I use sweet n low, it still doesn't calm down the caffeine that's in regular coffee.<br>
<br>
So here I am, no sleep, junk food, coffee and soda.  At 8 or 9, I started to get the shakes.  I was shaking so much...my teeth were chattering.  I almost felt as though I had to be cold because my teeth wouldn't stop chattering.  I felt that I should take a bath...so I did, but it didn't help.  I started freaking out thinking that I was going to die.  So I got out of the bath and I was instructed by one of my friends to lie down and have lots of water.<br>
<br>
Well this resulted in frequent visits to the bathroom.  I had a terrible ache in my stomach and I tried to lay down...but I felt like I couldn't go to sleep otherwise, I wouldn't wake up.  I was so alert of everything, even touching my arm was scary.  I was so alert that I was paranoid.  I started semi dozing off, but then I would snap out of it...it was almost like I was in a dream state and I knew I was, but I felt like if I snapped myself out of it, I wouldn't fall asleep and die.<br>
<br>
I couldn't sit still so I would walk around the house...but, climbing the stairs was a chore and breathing even seemed to be a little more intensified.  I would like to say that this is the first time that this has happened, but it's not.  I just realized this sensativity to caffeine this past June.  I thought it was stupid to blame it on the caffeine...but sure enough...each time I have it.  I get achey and I go into panic/anxiety attacks.<br>
<br>
This is it.  I am done.  I never want to experience this again, and the funny thing is that I used to drink caffeine all the time when I was younger...in my teens and such....and it never affected me.  Maybe I never paid attention.  But my body can't handle it anymore.<!-- End Body -->
