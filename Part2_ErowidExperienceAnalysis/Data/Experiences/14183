Foxy. That was the ill-gotten name of this crazy methoxy-like substance that had graced the lives of several students on campus. Foxy, what the hell was this stuff? Apparently, it was actually 2C-T-7, not what had originally been coined as Foxy (5-Meo-Dipt). But of course I didn't find out that bit of information until half way into dissasociation. <BR>
<BR>
I believe it was a Sunday night, about 10 p.m. when I was trying get my hands on something. Something new, something foreign to me, and my mind. Having being somewhat familiar with psychedelics in the past (LSD, Shrooms, etc.) I had decided and hoped that I might have a chance to get something of the sort. I had heard about this 'Foxy' stuff from a friend of a friend. Some loved it, some hated it. I wasn't sure how I would react. But after hearing it described as an a mix between a roll and a trip, I decided that I would give it a go. You only live once, and I was not about to let this oppourtunity slip away, since I have about the worst luck when it comes to finding anything bud weed. <BR>
<BR>
Having taken a double dose of prozac that morning for anxiety and other things, I paid the man and claimed my gelcap coated an off-white colored powder substance. I ran back as quickly as I could, excited to explore the unknowns of the mind. Tripping has always been an intense experience for me, and having luck with acid and mushrooms a few times in the past, I'd hoped that this stuff would grant me the same luck. So I took it down at about 10:30 with some water and waited.<BR>
<BR>
After about twenty minutes or so, I began to feel nausea. Nausea like I had never felt before, counteracted by a mild-stoning sensation. Trying not to make my roomate aware of what I had just put in my system, I acted completely normal, as soon my saline bottle started breathing. Very similar to lose doses of mushrooms, or acid. <BR>
<BR>
Intense pressure, and intense nausea was a huge part of the 10-12 hour trip. About two hours later I got invited up to a friends room where we chatted and threw on some techno. I had never rolled before, but started to feel this intense energy taking over my body. A strange sensation overtook my senses and perceptions, making it impossible to discern reality from anything else. <BR>
<BR>
At this point I was up to about the 4 hour mark, when dissapointed with the lack of visuals, me and my friends decided to light up a bowl of dank. What beautiful dank it was. During that moment I felt as if I could hit that lovely bud forever, without a breath of fresh air, as if I breathed only marijuana smoke. Weed always has a way of enhancing everything for me, and in this case, it did just that.<BR>
<BR>
While staring at the door and all around I began to notice a smeariness of colors surrounding the air, along with  circular patterns of insanity. I could see my blood move through my hand like a snake through water, my veins pumping colorful splashes of intoxicated blood. I felt I had entered another dimension. As if I was living inside a bubble-scope universe. It was a bit disconcerning and uncomfortable later in the trip as the nasuea returned and became to intense to stand. Visuals became stronger, but were hard to enjoy thanks to much pressure. Pressure that intensly interrogated my inner being.<BR>
<BR>
With all signs pointing to insomnia, I decided to stay alert and to go to breakfast the next morning. That day I slept for 15 hours, and woke up feeling surprisingly well. I would say that 2C-T-7 was a mix of shrooms and acid, but more like acid. Would I do it again? In the right mindset and setting probably.<BR>
<BR>
