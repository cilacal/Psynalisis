My better half had gone on a 'Hen Day' when I got home after work. I was not expecting her back until at least 11pm so I decided to give 2ct7 a good blast. 40mgs had given me something of a generic 2c buzz without too much visual phenomena on my first go a while back. This time I took 50mgs. It took rather a while to arrive and presented a simillar sort of scenario again. I had dosed at lunchtime and after a couple of hours I dropped another 25mgs for good measure. Well this really seemed to start the ball rolling in a more tangible fashion. <br>
<br>
Closed eye visuals were quite nice but of open eye visuals there was little. With eyes closed, grids and meshes of light interwove and seethed, with often jagged forms. The colourscape was dominated by yellow, green and some blue hues. I am sure I had read of this before, so it might have been shaped by the power of suggestion. Also in my mind was the yellow of sulphur, (the t in 2ctXs, or 'thio'), and the blue of copper sulphate. I was buzzing away but still hoping for more. <br>
  <br>
At 4pm, to my surprise, P. arrived home. By this point the second dose was well on its way. Unfortubately she wanted me to drive her back into town for her evening out. I had not counted this possibility into the equation. Rather than admit that I was beginning to become densly befuddled on a crazy drug, I calmly agreed and went to the bathroom for a pep talk with myself before getting underway.  <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> <br>
<br>
The afternoon traffic was dense. The heavens opened torrentially once we set off and the view out was a misty lightshow of splendour. Somehow my  skills were relatively intact and there were no casualties. A less than pleasant episode, one which was extremely ill-advised. On the homeward strait, things began to get hectic. I reversed into the drive and made a bid for the front door with some urgency.<br>
  <br>
Back home I now decided that I had a good six hours until she returned, in which I would dose the last of my 4-AcO-DMT vial. I was still heavily under the spell of the 2ct7, through which the by now familliar 4-AcO effects became filtered. The AcO visuals usually feature warm reds, yellows and blues, but these were tinted yellowy green. The forms were rendered more jagged, although the geometric writhing towards my mindspace that sometimes leads to entity type embodiments on 4-AcO was still discernable, but the audio hallucinations that I usually have were changed. The buzzing and clicking (of a kind of musical nature) that AcO can generate were given a very jagged tone, in the same trajectory as the visuals had been. As though someone had added a dash of thrash metal to the sonic mix. <br>
<br>
As the AcO built up, these sounds and visuals became a bit manic and discordant. It occurred to me that there might be something 'wrong' about mixing these two substances. I have built up a feeling of comfort and familiarity with what 4-AcO does to me, and I considered whether I had betrayed some relationship with it by using it in this way. These thoughts seemed to be parallel with how some psychedelic users treat certain substances or plants as 'allies'. Then I thought, cheerfully, 'Who gives a fuck', in the sense that I am free not to do this combination again if it is not to my liking.<br>
  <br>
As the peak passed I occupied a mindspace where, within the clarity, I could visualise thoughts popping up into my conscious mind from deep down and disappearing again. I watched this phenomena with some interest. I also began to hear music writing itself in my mind, hearing the whole concept evolving 'live'as it were. I smoked many joints as the evening went on and settled to bed just as P. returned home. A long and interesting day it had been.<br>
  <br>
Today I have felt rather fine and I hope to get a good nights sleep tonight. The night after a night of indulgence is usually a good nights sleep. Goodnight.<!-- End Body -->
