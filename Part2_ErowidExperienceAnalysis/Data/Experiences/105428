<!-- Start Body -->
Me:<br/>
63kg white male. 30 years old. Generally, my reactions to psychoactives are idiosyncratic; for instance, I loathe cannabis and MDMA makes me feel sad and antisocial. So take this report with a grain of salt-your mileage may vary. I probably have tolerance due to abortive low-dose mescaline trip 16 hrs earlier, several days light changa and bufotenine use, 5-MeO-MiPT seven days prior, and a light dose of MAL roughly two weeks back. It would be surprising wasn't some receptor down-regulation.<br/>
<br/>
Background:<br/>
Positive or neutral experiences with: BZP (with and without TFMPP), salvia, mescaline, 5:MeO-DMT, DMT, NMT, ketamine, DXM, kratom, adrafanil, psilocybin, amphetamine, amanita muscaria, LSD, bufotenine, ayahuasca, nitrous oxide, hawaiian baby woodrose extract, ephedrine, mesembrine, sulbutiamine, miprocin, moxy, MAL, bk-2C-B<br/>
Negative experiences with: cannabis, 2C-C, hawaiian baby woodrose whole, MDMA, phenibut<br/>
(excepting mescaline and MAL, phenethylamines have never really proven very psychedelic or visual for me, and MDMA makes me miserable. I respond favourably to tryptamines).<br/>
<br/>
Mood: Neutral, uninvested<br/>
<br/>
Setting: Home alone<br/>
<br/>
Timeline:<br/>
12:45PM Weighed, measured, and swallowed 45mg 6-APDB +/-2mg.<br/>
<br/>
1:11 Been noticing typical serotonergic spacy alert for a while now. Suggestion of nausea hasn't manifested yet.<br/>
<br/>
1:13 Really alerting now. Slight agitation. Heart a little racy.<br/>
<br/>
1:21 Mild tingling scalp. Some mild chest pressure. Just a suggestion of jaw tension.<br/>
<br/>
1:40 Colors are mildly brighter. Slight increase in jaw tension. Some hesitancy about eating, although I'm hungry. Vaguely toxic phenethylamine/speedy feel, like the 2c-xs. Have wanted to poop for a while now, but have been ignoring it. I'm not especially impressed with this space. I feel noticeably altered, but it's not particularly positively or negatively. There's no positive mood push. I'm guessing that higher doses might intensify the euphoria, the fogginess, and perhaps prove psychedelic. Zero music enhancement. Did get some insight on my life outlook and how it is shaped by societal expectations of work and leisure, how I am disenchanted by the absence of a space in my professional life for exploration and new experiences, that it's unlikely to change for decades, bringing me to a place where I will be less able to exploit the opportunity. My body is warming up nicely. My mindset is marked by a growing nonspecific sense of peace and cotentment.<br/>
<br/>
1:50 It's starting in earnest. I took the time to lay back, meditate, and listen to music, which sounds immersive. No mood lift can push through my body's sedentary lifestyle-induced endorphin deficit. Some OEV activity suggested, but not manifested-just a pleasant, plasticy high gloss and color enhancement that can't push through at this dosage. It's as though my vision wants to resolve into the aesthetic of Tim Burton's 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.<br/>
<br/>
2:00 Had decided to work out to raise endorphins, then recalled that increased body temperature was the main cause of neurotoxicty, so I stopped my calisthenics. Kind of want some caffeine.<br/>
<br/>
2:06 Think I've reached plateau. Things are smooth and light reflections glossy, nice to look at. Scalp tingles slightly when touched. Other touch not much enhanced.<br/>
<br/>
Legs feel a bit restless, like on MAL. I have energy to do something, but nothing to do, which is not unpleasant. I just wish I had something to do that suited this space, as it is not psychedelic enough on its own to demand my attention. I would not drive like this, obviously, but a walk or gentle bike ride would be pleasant were it not brutally cold outside. Eating crackers and water over the last half hour produced no discomfort-I think I'm good to eat. Incidentally, this space is much nicer than MDMA for me, but that's not exactly a ringing endorsement. The visuals are similar but better than at 110mg bk-2c-b, music enhancement a little better. Some similarity to mescaline in terms of mental clarity, positive body, and sense of gentle peace. I think a dose of 125mg would be quite a bit more interesting.<br/>
<br/>
2:25 Seriously considered adding another 25-50mg either orally or through insufflation. Insufflation due to rapid onset and shorter duration, orally because of preference of agonism (psychedelia) over releasing (euphoria). Really would like more psychedelia. It's right on the cusp of being visually interesting in its own right, but too engrossing to do other things that might be entertaining.<br/>
<br/>
2:40 Dosed another 20mg +/-2mg orally.<br/>
<br/>
3:27 Might be feeling the second dose come on. Had the same toxic feeling as before when coming on, now has heavy serotonergic feeling and same subtle hint of nausea<br/>
<br/>
4:00 Serotonergic effects may be somewhat stronger, but subjectively don't feel like much has changed in the experience. Mood stable, more entactogenesis. More desire<br/>
and inability to defecate. No change in visuals, body temperature. Ever so slightly more jaw tension. Didn't really add anything so far. Know I should eat food, but<br/>
nothing sounds appealing. Appetite suppression then, I guess. Pretty clear headed for a serotonin releaser. I feel languid, so stressful video games are not appealing.<br/>
Watching a movie or reading doesn't sound entertaining, though. Music is great. Shivers tingle across my bare torso when I scratch my nails across myself. Colours are more warm and the light in the room feels like it just got turned up. Some pupil dilation.<br/>
<br/>
4:20 Looking up from the book I'm reading, I note some dry mouth, more jaw tension, more compulsive swallowing. More OEV activity, plasticy glistening surfaces.<br/>
<br/>
4:30 I've been struggling to think of what this space reminds me of. I have compared it quite closely to bk-2C-B and loosely to mescaline. It lacks the dreaminess of LSA. So, synthetic gloss, mild but everpresent stimulation, and relatively clear head. It is much like a low-dose LSD experience with added entactogenesis and fewer (so far) side effects. That also explains my indifference to it, as my LSD experiences have never been all that profound or visually rich.<br/>
<br/>
5:00 Noting the start, ever so slowly, of the decline I believe.<br/>
<br/>
5:36 Noting some trippiness again. Now more like mescaline than lsd. I wonder if this is what MDA is like. There is absolutely zero empathogenisis with this material. The character is pretty neutral, although leaning towards the antisocial. Given that MDMA makes me want to flee other people's company and be miserable and solitary, that's a definite plus side to this substance. Eating is easy. So is not eating.<br/>
<br/>
7:15 Part of me thinks that I prefer a cup of tea to this: clean mood lift, clear head, calm, and a short duration. I recognize, though, that this could be quite nice in a situation where I was already enjoying myself thoroughly, such as an art walk or arboretum trip or outdoor concert perhaps. It's neutral tone could and long duration be an asset then. I think this is what Sasha and Ann would call a 'museum level' trip.<br/>
<br/>
7:45 Dropping off more proounced now; drinking a 10% beer now. Partner came home. Realized that, although I felt fairly lucid, I had some trouble with word finding in conversation. It was also a little hard to keep my mind on track while I was talking, and I struggled to speak at my usual fast pace. I'd place it somewhere between the serotoin releaser monginess and mushroomy linguistic center trouble.<br/>
<br/>
8:00 Drank three strong beers total and a weak cider. I recognize that mixing anything, particularly alcohol, with new RCs is stupid. I did, however, feel like the effects were almost entirely diminished bar residual stimulation, and was dreading a long night of drug-induced insomnia.<br/>
<br/>
Next day: A benzo may have been a better option over beer, as I woke several times in the middle of the night with a splitting headache. Drank a glass of water and took some baby aspirin each time, but still had a splitting headache in the morning after a very poor night's sleep. Ibuprofen and caffeine sorted me out tolerably well, although I was still pretty monged out (likely from alcohol and sleep deprivation.) Typing up this report at late in the following evening, I'm making bizarre and totally uncharacteristic spelling mistakes, but feel otherwise fine. There was no mid-week mood dip, but I've never had any post-MDMA or post-BZP+TFMPP mood issues before.<br/>
<br/>
Overview: Low level of side effects and easy, steady, long-lasting headspace make me think this would be great for a mellow day of strolling around a park or museum, maybe a sit-down outdoor concert. Doesn't offer a lot on its own to me at this dosage. Surprisingly unerotic.<!-- End Body -->
