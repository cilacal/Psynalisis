10:00 pm - went to wal mart with both capsules.. we needed cups so we went inside and got plastic cups.. filled cups with quarter water and dissolved pills in each cup.. me and stu drank our 1 cup.. <br>
<br>
10:45- went to local high school where we met Stu's younger brother where we got the 1 bowl of cannabis.. (stu and I felt nothing at this point)<br>
<br>
11:10- arrived at lookout where we usually smoke our weed.. my bowl had been laced with amt from the night before so there was some in the smoking experiance.. after a couple hits i let Stu take a couple so i could chill out.. palms get sweaty and paranoia sets in.. every car we see scares the hell out of us.. <br>
<br>
11:30- leave lookout and begin to drive around to experiance AMT.. begin to feel weird as we drive by houses the view of them looked like moving pictures.. i (lewis) began to forget directions to everywhere.. we set back off to wal mart.  <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> <br>
<br>
12:15- we sat in the parking lot enjoying life frequently saying 'im so fucked up'.. the trip was so positive and felt great.. <br>
<br>
12:30- we walk into wal mart and the lights were the first thing we noticed as they were blinding at first.. (eyes are dilated) people talking around us felt like echoes.<br>
<br>
12:30-1:00 - Wal Mart trip was crazy as we went and played with toys.. i remember Stu saying that the Gi-jo's looked like criogenically frozen people int he plastic boxes.. we went and looked at lava lamps and electricity globes which were just mind blowing.. still tripping heavilly at this point.<br>
<br>
1:25- decide to go to 'Harris Hill' a lookout next to a glider landing strip.. we couldnt go outside as the paranoia freaked us out and we had to run back into the car.. looking over the lookout at the nearest town looked like we were flying and Stu thought it was an under water city (I agreed).. <br>
<br>
1:45- decided to roll down windows and listen to Pink Floyd while looking at the stars.. then in a peak into the trip out of nowhere in the same spot we were looking a shooting star flew by and we started yelling in amazement.. (coolest shit ever!)<br>
<br>
2:00- went to Sam's Club and got outside at which we noticed the trees branches were pulsating and growing.. decided to go back into the car and into wal mart again (wal mart was the only store opened at this time)<br>
<br>
2:10- in wal mart the decorations on the ceilings made it look like poles which made us think wal mart was upside down.. at this point i felt i was in a circus.. (still tripping)<br>
<br>
2:15- in Wal mart walked through a asile of mirrors and clocks.. felt like we were int he Pink Floyd song 'Time'.. looking at ourselfs in the mirrors was like looking at strangers..<br>
<br>
2:30- decided to go to Big Flats a local town in which we walked around in the freezing cold.. the abandoned builinds was like people looking in the windows.. it was like a ghost town as it was so late.. then went into a parking lot where we spun in cirles.. that was to crazy to tell..<br>
<br>
3:00-5:00 - basically dont remember much but feeling the trip was lasting so long and tripping our balls for so long.. as we were driving around the moon looked upside down and we saw a floating light int he sky which we were convinced it was a UFO..<br>
<br>
5:30- had to go to Stu's house as the driving around was to crazy.. as we walked in the dark of his house made our visuals come out more then ever..<br>
<br>
5:45-9:00 - Sat in Stu's room listening to music and enjoying the trip as he would turn out the lights and I (lewis) saw the walls moving in waves and circles of light floating in front of me.. Stu saw the ceiling drip down and he tried to touch it as it sucked back up into a vortex into the celeing (complex but crazy).<br>
<br>
MORNING- when morning came and his mom was up we tried sleeping but only got about an hour of nap time then the whole next day we felt weird as almost tripping again with eyes dilated for many hours after ...<br>
<br>
Awsome experiance ...<!-- End Body -->
