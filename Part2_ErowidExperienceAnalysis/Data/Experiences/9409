I have done shrooms, weed, salvia, morphine and dextroamphetamine, and am always open tp try something at least once. So when my friend with ADHD told me she had Adderall, which is a combination of dextroamphetamine and amphetamine, I decided I'd give it a try. <BR>
<BR>
I popped 2 and a half 30 mg pills at about 2:30 PM. I had heard that it is very managable and easy to act normal, so I thought I'd have no problem while being on it in front of my parents. I basically forgot I had taken anything until about 4 PM, when I realized that it had been one and a half hours and i didn't feel anything! I was very disappointed and figured I should've taken more. <BR>
<BR>
At about 5 PM I realized that it had kicked in big time. I was talking 1000 words per minute and didn't realize it. I also realzed that I had this body high going, and I felt invincible! I was running around the neighborhood for no reason just feeling great, while thinking to myself 'this is the greatest drug in the world!' I loved the feeling I got, lots of energy and I wasn't afraid to talk to anyone and the euphoria was awesome. Although my mouth was really dry and i kept foaming.<BR>
<BR>
About 8 hours after taking it I came home and was still racing around. My mom came into my room and asked me if I had taken anythign because I was acting strange (my mom has had a lot of experience with drugs in her lifetime so she knows all the side effects and shit like that, it kinda sux). I told her 'no, what are you talking about'. But she just kept telling me that she knew I was and that lying about it would only make it worse. So I finally gave in like an idiot. At the time I didn't feel bad about it at all because of the euphoria. <BR>
<BR>
About 4 hours later I decided to go to sleep. YA RIGHT!!! I laid down for about 2 minutes and got up because it was impossible. Then I got a stomach ache. One of the worst ones I hade ever gotten. I thought it was diarrhea or something, so I went to sit on the toilet. I sat there for about an hour to no avail. I just stared at the floor because it looked like all these grains of sand were jumping around on the ground. I went back to my room and after about a half hour thought that 'now i can go'. So i went to the bathroom, sat on the toilet, with nothing. My stomach hurt so bad I wished I had never done any drugs in my life. I ended up spending about 3 and a half hours on the toilet that night with no results and didn't get a wink of sleep. My parents were very disappointed in me the next day.<BR>
<BR>
The effects of this drug are great, I loved them. But its not worth the horrible side effects. I'm sure a lot of people won't get them, and I wish I didn't either.<!-- End Body -->
