First Time User of Amanita Muscaria<br/>
<br/>
I bought an Oz of Amanita Muscaria online from a trusted vendor in the Midwest. It was shipped to my house in three days, which slightly surprised me at because I live in central Maine. It came in a small package, with an alien like script to the English letters. It was labeled: 'Washington State Amanita A+' (grade). I was excited, and debated whether to take it immediately. I stored it in the fridge for a couple of hours, and then decided to do it, figuring I was ready. <br/>
   <br/>
I read that it causes intense nausea, and so just before doing it, I bought Pepto Bismo, and took two or three pills in my apartment. I took about 1/4 of the the package or 7 grams immediately. I felt a change in perception quite quickly, within about 15 minutes. It was similar to a marijuana high, but with slightly less intensity and slightly different in a way that is hard to communicate, except as with less mind-rushing or weirdness. <br/>
    <br/>
The intensity of the initial dose was about on a scale of 1-10 a 2 or a 3. I listened to some music and relaxed on my day off from work. It felt great to have a day off from my busy and exhausting 6 day work week. The effects tapered off quickly.<br/>
    <br/>
Later that night, around 6PM, I decided to take a risky leap into the unknown and take what was rest, about 21 grams. I may have taken one or two more tabs of the Pepto Bismo, but I can't remember. The taste was actually decent, crunchy but sweet. I then laid back on my bed, relaxed, and listened to music. I initially felt muscle twitches, which I had expected because I researched the mushrooms extensively before I did them. They were slight. I then closed my eyes for visuals, but got extremely close to nothing. Perhaps more dots and and colors or a brief image, but nothing more.<br/>
      <br/>
As I listened to music on my laptop, I noticed the music was mildly altered because of the mushrooms. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">I noticed the music was mildly altered because of the mushrooms.</div></div> They had more meaning to them, more depth. Nothing profound though. I noticed mind effects like a slightly intense marijuana high. My vision was extremely blurred, to the point I could not see with any accuracy literally beyond 5 ft. I was salivating with increased intensity. No extreme lose of balance and no nausea though. I watched some visually trippy videos on YouTube, and the Amanita intensified the trippiness. The wall was breathing for a few seconds after I watched a video, and the screen became intensely wavy, moving and shifting, but only for a shot duration like the breathing effects. I was at this point like a 5.5 to a 6 on ten scale as far as intoxicated from them.<br/>
   <br/>
I was feeling upbeat, so I took a hot shower. I felt slightly dissociated from it, like I expected, and found some of the effects to be like DXM, like I expected also. It felt good though. I then walked back to my bed when I had dried off. I was intensely sweating and slightly shaking. I had a fever, but I felt quite intense euphoria, despite my only slightly euphoric day. I then smoked a small cigar, and felt slight bliss. When I was done it was about 12, and I feel asleep. I woke and noticed my pillow was soaked from sweating.<br/>
<br/>
I did a large amount for my first time, especially given my body weight, though I have an extremely fast metabolism. The effects were nothing life-altering or spiritual. It had a mild trippy effect to it, with mild activation of thought and perception awakened that are not normally. I expected a little more intensity. It's intensity was about a 4-5 overall, and during it's peak like a 6.5. The physical symptoms did not peak until right before I went to bed, like 3-4 hours after taking them, and the mind effects did not peak until about 2 hours and plateaued for like 2 more.<!-- End Body -->
