This is single handedly the most insane 2C-P experience I have ever had. I've gone up to 40mg with this drug and no other time was as insane as this. I'm very experienced with phenethylamines and this blew me out of the water. I am going to try to go into as much detail as possible but some of the visuals I had are unexplainable with words. So let's get this trip report started!<br/>
<br/>
3:00PM- Me and my friend dose, he takes 15mg and I take 35mg in some dark ginger ale, tastes a little off but nothing much.<br/>
<br/>
3:25PM- We both start to feel in physically affecting our legs, and the uncomfortableness in our backs as we walk to go pick up some pot for the night.<br/>
<br/>
4:00PM- I start to get some mild visuals, while my friend is not getting much of anything but the body load.<br/>
<br/>
4:25PM- Time is slowing down as we are talking and jamming to some A Tribe Called Quest, very groovy stuff. I really recommend it for tripping.<br/>
<br/>
5:00PM- I am starting to trip hard as the visuals start pouring in. My buddy starts to trip too but too a lesser extent.<br/>
<br/>
5:25PM- Our friends come over J and R. We are unable to talk to them as my visuals were way too intense and my friend is laughing too much.<br/>
<br/>
6:15PM- They leave because it is unbearable to be around us since we can't hold a conversation with them. Once they are gone I put A Tribe Called Quest back on and my visuals start literally flowing and bumping with the music, conversation between my friend and I flow very smoothly as well since we are both on the same “loop” as we called it. Everything was very intense but it was also amazingly fun!<br/>
<br/>
6:45PM- This is when things started to get way too intense, I was losing all of my vision to visuals and everything just started to bump, swirl, flow, and groove. I kept on forgetting about reality and started to go into different ones. I thought I had entered a parallel universe and had forgotten about everything, where I was, who I was, everything.<br/>
<br/>
7:00PM- I'm beginning to give up. As I go from a different reality to another, to another I lose sense of everything. I am unable to see as the visuals are too strong. I get my friend to pack me a batch bowl (Tobacco and weed), as I'm smoking it I get back into the real reality for a little bit, then the visuals come back even stronger while the flowing of the visuals continue, everything is just so jazzy and groovey, but too intense for me so I question taking some benzos to come down.<br/>
<br/>
7:25PM- What was really 25 minutes felt like 3 hours. Im done and begging for help. I swallow 1.5mg clonazolam waiting for the trip to be done.<br/>
<br/>
7:50PM- I can't take it anymore Im begging to come down from this trip. Around this time is when I black out from the benzos. My friend told me I was up till about 12PM, but I have no recollection of it.<br/>
<br/>
Overall I would not recommend this to anyone unless they have done DMT or a drug of similar sorts. Because a dose like this of real good 2C-P will mess with your head and you will lose your vision. I went a little crazy during the trip and because I had not experienced anything like this. Not even with the 40mg 2C-P trip.<br/>
<br/>
Have fun and be safe guys!<!-- End Body -->
