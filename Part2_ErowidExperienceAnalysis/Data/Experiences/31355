My friend told me that hallucinogens simply magnify whatever is going on in your mind at a certain point in your life.  2C-I put my entire life under a high powered microscope.  Things have not been the same since I took a 22 mg pill of the stuff.<BR>
<BR>
The night started out fine, we smoked an unholy amount of bud, about 6 or 7 bowls out of our giant piece.  During this, me and my friend decided to drop the 2C-I that we had just bought, figuring there was no time like the present to expand our minds. That's when everything got weird.  As I was sitting outside on a friend's porch, the trees around me started to dance, they turned into tribal figures, and their dance was almost hyponotic.  Then, more and more people kept showing up, and I realized that I didn't recognize them.  Slowly I came to the epiphany that there were not people actually coming and going, they were just there, and I was stuck in a time warp.  Deja vu, deja vu...Everything was deja vu. We decided that we should leave my friend's house, since we were locked out, and were just hanging out on his porch.  It was the middle of the winter, and we were all going numb from cold along with the chemical enhancements.<BR>
<BR>
The car ride, I got lost in the backseat.  I knew in the back of my mind that we were in familiar territory, but I didn't recognize anything.  I was in a whole new world.<BR>
<BR>
We went to a church lounge to hang out.  I laid on a couch, and the feeling of deja vu returned.  I watched the same show on the tv about 384290874219047 times.  Eventually, someone I didn't know  (for real, not just because of the trip) walked in, and I was apparently laying on his coat (or so my friends tell me), and he told me to move, but I couldn't understand him, it was like he was speaking a completely different language.<BR>
<BR>
This is when the space odessey began.  I was an astronaut on a far off planet, everything was strange to me, eventually people didn't even look human anymore, they took on some form that I can't even describe, all I can say is that they scared me more than I have ever been scared in my life.<BR>
<BR>
Will I ever be sober again?<BR>
<BR>
The question kept running through my mind, how could what I be seeing not be real?  how could I be a part of the strange world that I was watching from afar?  This is when the trip took a sinister turn.<BR>
<BR>
I had experienced a gentle numbness throughout the trip, until I got scared, then it felt like thousands of knifes were stabbing me all over my body, the pain was excruciating.  Then, my mind was playing tricks on me, I forgot everything.  I was lost and I didn't know where I belonged, the world was foreign to me and I didn't ever want to go back, though at the same time I didn't want to be in this state of mind anymore.<BR>
<BR>
As I came down, reestablished my sanity as it were, I slowly realized that my mind had been expanded, though I still question today whether or not that is a positive or negative thing.  I gained a new ability to put myself in others' shoes, I left my body and went into everyone else's body, and lived their lives for  a while, I gained new insight into who they are as human beings.  Then suddenly everything made sense to me, we are all one.  Coinsciousness is a temporary state in each body, yet the collective coinsciousness is eternal.  the reason that we should all be kind to each other and work to make life go smoothly for other people is that eventually coinsciousness will switch and you will be inside that other person's mind, and you will feel all of the pain that you have caused them, but at the same time all the joy that you caused.<BR>
<BR>
The experience in itself has made me much more in tune with other people's feelings.  I didn't always consider what my actions would do to other people, now it's become second nature, I'm afraid to cause other people pain, because your effect on other people is your afterlife, be it your heaven or hell.  crazy eh?<BR>
<BR>
Overall, I don't recommend 2C-I for such an uncontrolled atmosphere that my experience took place.  I'm sure the trip would have been different had I known what was going to happen, but I didn't and it scared the hell outta me.  I'm never going to do another drug like 2C-I, it's taught me all I care to learn, but that isn't to say that other people can't have the experience, but get ready for a crazy ride if you so choose.<!-- End Body -->
