I am writing this as I induce and experience the effects of Mescaline, taken in the form of San Pedro cactus tea, for the first time. I cut off about 15 inches of cactus, but that is irrelevant, seeing as how each species and specific variety of cactus has vastly different mescaline content. I am in a controlled environment (my girlfriends house), have good music on, and I am about to take the first glass.<BR>
<BR>
T+00:01... Oh christ, this is worse tasting than homemade Absinthe. Holy fuck, my mouth is numb...<BR>
<BR>
T+00:45... Everything is comical. Like, the part of the brain that would register something as funny or ironic is being triggered randomly. As in: 'focus on movie... focus... focus... YOU'RE EATING NOODLES! HAHAHAHAHAHAHA!... why am I laughing? Why was that funny? Oh god, I'm high.'<BR>
<BR>
T+01:45... Getting deeper into the high. It is very very mellowing. Some odd visuals are starting to appear. Right now it is just trails along all light. Light, reflections, shiny surfaces, all leave a trail when they move.<BR>
<BR>
T+02:30... Note: Try looking at a strobe light through a prism while on mescaline. The light is like a liquid. No longer traveling in straight lines, it bends and melts over every inch of my body, and every surface it touches. Shadows and light mix like oil and water. It's strange; the visuals are there and not there at the same time. Its like I have control over what I see. Which gives me the vibe that the drug itself isn't that powerful, but it enables you to give yourself more control... its an interesting line, because a lot of people expect drugs to entertain them, but with this cactus, it seems the drug only expands what you can do, while leaving you in control.<BR>
<BR>
T+05:00... (Mescaline is an aphrodesiac and a highly reccomended one. Hee hee hee) At this point I feel a very strong, almost spiritual connection with everything around me. I am not usualy a person to feel sentimental attachment to anything at all, but right now every object that I make use of is as precious to me as if it were alive.<BR>
<BR>
T+06:00... Still high. I've been high for so long I can no longer remember which of my feelings are stoned and which of them are normal, and which ones are worth mentioning... I don't want it to sound like I am taking the trip for granted, it's just that everything has melted together at this point. The very words I am typing loose their meaning as soon as they hit the page... this is intense and beautiful in every way. It is beautiful asthetically, beautiful emotionaly, and fulfilling in an amazingly deep sense. My relationship to the world at large is so very intimate and personal... <BR>
<BR>
I'm going to conclude this report by saying I highly reccomend this drug. I feel this drug is now a part of my soul, and I would feel cheap and dirty if I sold it for profit, or used it simply for entertainment. The state of mind is unique for each person that takes it, and should be treated with the same respect you have for your own body and mind. The drug really bonds to you. I feel that if I sold it, I would be selling myself. And anyone who I give it to is also recieving a special part of me...<!-- End Body -->
