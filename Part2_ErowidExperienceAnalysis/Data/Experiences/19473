The night began with a group of friends who had not been introduced to the effects of 5-MeO-DiPT.  Everyone had previously experimented with LSD and MDMA, but this clear liquid (as I obtained it) was new.  I, however, had taken 10 mg of 5-MeO-DiPT twice before, and wanted everyone to have a great time that night.  They were all a bit skeptical.  We mixed about 5 ml of the liquid (containing approx. 10 mg of 5-Meo-DiPT) with a shot of vodka.  The main comment was that it tasted like shit, and the taste remained on the tongue despite repeated washings with fruit juices and other alcohol. The group consisted of 3 guys and 1 girl, the guys varying in weight from 165-190 pounds.  On the way to the club, I mixed the remaining portion in the bottle with some Dr. Pepper, about another 5 mg (waste not, want not!).<BR>
<BR>
We went to a club that night, and continued drinking various forms of alcohol.  About 30 minutes into it, I began to feel very ramped, like the effects of cocaine.  The average volume of the club and the group began to grow, until things began to get very loud and very blended.  It was difficult at times to hear particular conversations around me.  The guys did not begin to feel the effects until approx. 50 minutes after ingestion.  They did not realize, however, how loud they were talking up until that point.  One of the guys turned to me and said that everyone in the club had a halo around them, like they could see their auras.  Another mentioned that the music had gotten louder but indistinguishable, and that it became amusing to watch people talk, because he could see their mouths move but not hear what they said. I had a particularly good visual trip; the combination of strobe lights, colored lights and fog in the club made my eyes dance back and forth so badly that my eyes actually hurt.<BR>
<BR>
The effect of people moving and dancing was also particularly enjoyable, as they appeared to be streaming through space.  The guys also mentioned that they felt exhilarated, and repeated comments were made that they wanted to snort a bit of the white goddess. They did mention that it was a bit hard-edged, but their visual experiences were worth it. With the great visuals and jovial mood of the group (I noticed that the guys were spending ridiculous amounts of money on alcohol), I decided to drop a roll, and asked one of the guys if he would like to join me.  We both consumed, and in a matter of 15 minutes we were rolling off our asses.  We went back inside the club, and everything from the music (which got more defined, the highs being extremely fine and the bass pounding) to the atmosphere was floating and carefree.  The combination provided me with an excellent visual experience, although I felt that the 'rolling' effect of the MDMA became slightly overshadowed by the adrenalin effects of the 5-MeO-DiPT after a while.<BR>
<BR>
Once we left the club, we decided to stop off for some whippets and to take more MDMA.  Once in a comfortable atmosphere at home, the second roll took off and the bottomless pit set in.  Periods of black out were experienced, and the tunnel effect as well as the musical enhancement  of the whippets was particularly nice.  The entire experience lasted about 6 hours.<!-- End Body -->
