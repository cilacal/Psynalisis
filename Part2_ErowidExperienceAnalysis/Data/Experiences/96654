Substance:  'Scooby Snax Potpourri' – Only later did I find out that the active chemical is the Synthetic Cannabinoid Receptor Agonist UR-144.<br/>
<br/>
Set and Setting:  A friend’s room in his house in Myrtle Beach.  It was my first day of spring break and my friends bought the bong and the 10g package of 'Scooby Snax' –  on the boardwalk.  I am a regular user of marijuana but took a short (2 and a half week) tolerance break before I got there.  I heard good and bad things about Spice and these other herbal incenses so before smoking I was somewhat nervous.  In case of a freakout or any other bad instance, I had my iPod present so I can zone out and try to enjoy myself.<br/>
 <br/>
Dosage:  One large hit out of a new bong, inhaled and exhaled first hit then cleared the bowl.  Estimated 0.75 to 1.0 grams of potpourri.<br/>
<br/>
Immediately upon exhale, I felt a pulling on my face, like gravity was pulling me forward.  At this point I can already tell this isn’t going to be similar to a marijuana high, and it wasn’t going to be an enjoyable experience.  The high kept getting substantially more powerful and was escalating way too fast.  About 2 minutes in I am way too high and have a very uncomfortable body buzz.  5 minutes in and I am having terrifying psychedelic thoughts, this is only the beginning of the fear that was about to ensue, however.  <br/>
<br/>
I lay down on the bed to try and relax and wait it out while all of my friends continue to smoke the bong. Not my best idea.  The ceiling fan was on and created a strobing effect that kept pulling my attention towards it.  I fall into a trance that lasts an immeasurable amount of time and am only broken away when a friend comments how everybody in the room looks like a clown of some sort.  This comment sparked a reaction in my mind and I wanted to leave the room for some reason and go hang out with my one sober friend downstairs.  They said I probably shouldn’t so I lay back down and closed my eyes.  Another bad idea.  CEV’s were terrifying and added to my paranoia and fear.  When I opened my eyes they were watching a video on youtube that was like a black and white spiraling tunnel.  I couldn’t look at it even though I usually enjoy that sort of thing.  I should also mention that a friend who watched the video on repeat for an hour and half pissed his pants and didn’t realize until the next day.  I told them I was going downstairs and I left the room.  <br/>
<br/>
WORST IDEA OF THE NIGHT.  When high on marijuana, it is not uncommon for me to experience very powerful déjà vu experiences.  It happens while sober sometimes as well and while doing research I found out it could be a form of epilepsy but I have never been diagnosed epileptic.  Anyways, when I opened the door of the room I felt the déjà vu starting and I had a very familiar feeling of death.  Its very hard to explain, but it felt like I had seen this moment before in a dream and my dream was telling me this is how I would die. So to add to the paranoia, fear, and nausea, I now have this terrible feeling that my brain is melting and that I am going to die tonight.  The déjà vu lasted for about an hour, and then the purging started.  I vomited the Sonic that I ate earlier and also some unidentifiable objects that I perceived at the time to be proof that I was poisoned and it made me certain that I was dead, never to come back.  After the purging had ended, it was the most stoned I have ever been in my life.  My arms and legs weighed thousands of pounds and I could only crawl to my bed and sleep but I was filled with relief that I survived this awful experience.  I will never again smoke synthetic cannabinoids that someone I don’t know cooked up in a lab somewhere.  I sometimes question the legal system, how is this shit legal and our beloved Cannabis is not…<!-- End Body -->
