One night I was with a group of friends and they had some AMT the kind that smells like mothballs, I insisted that one friend front me 2 capsules which had 50mg each in them.  He did so I opened them up and emptied them out onto the table, everyone in the room told me don’t snort that much because I will not like it.  I said don’t worry about it I have tripped my brains out before, this was the second time I took AMT.  The first time I didn’t have any visuals just the feeling like I was on MDMA, (the reason it didn’t hit me was because of the cross tolerance the night before I took 1 roll) so I figured 100mg wouldn’t do much more than the 50mg I took the first time.<BR>
<BR>
So after I did it the burn was crazy for about 10min then everyone kept saying man you should get home before it hits you.  I said I am fine, finally after about 30min I decided to go home it didn’t kick in yet, so I took my friend home and while I was driving home the AMT hit me, the visuals started.  I was so lucky to have made it home that night.  As soon as I came home I went downstairs and just was like oh man.  The visions I saw were like nothing I had experienced before it was stronger than taking 13hits of acid seriously.  I just sat there and my body was in euphoria and I closed my eyes and could swim with the dolphins in the ocean.  It was that great.<BR>
<BR>
Then the jaw clenching and the shivering started so I went and got some water and kept drinking water the rest of the time I was tripping.  I just stayed in my basement the whole time because I couldn’t let my mom see me like this so after the whole night of tripping my face off I went upstairs when the visuals were gone but the rolling feeling was still there.  I went to my mom and told her what I did and she wasn’t mad because of the fact it is legal.  I opened up to her for the first time in my life, I am 19 years old and never talked to my mom like I did on AMT, it is great for people who need to open up and talk.<BR>
<BR>
I talked to her for about an hour and told her how I felt and all she sat there and talked to me about life and everything.  I wouldn’t recommend anyone taking 100mg their first time.  It's very intense VERY INTENSE.  Also make sure you drink plenty of water, as your body will appreciate that.  I didn’t throw up nor have any diarrhea as some people reported.<!-- End Body -->
