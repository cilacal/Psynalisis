Monday 7:30 a.m. I chugged a fifth of vodka and got smashed (normal routine for me)<br>
<br>
10:00 a.m. I decided to chug another fifth (not routine) and from there I blacked out. Next thing I know it's 5:00 p.m. I went to the liquor cabinet and found it empty. OH SHIT! I had no money left, so I knew what comes next: HELL! I knew it was going to be a rough night, but not like I ever expected. One should know that I haven't touched alcohol since this happened, and I pray for those who still suffer such an affliction.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I'm sure you heard about pink elephants? Well, it's not true. They are actually demons! HORRIBLE DEMONS!!!!! When the withdrawls began, I began to shake violenly. This was normal for me, considering that I went through it several times before. Then I blacked out again, which I didn't expect. I can only assume that it was a seizure. When I came to, it was around 2:00 a.m. That is when the hallucinations began.<br>
<br>
I was sitting on the roof of a victorian style house lookin at the ground approx. 3 stories below. Sitting next to me was my fiance. The funny thing is that she died three years prior (I've been drinking non-stop since). She pointed to the lawn below and said, 'You should be down there, Not up here.' After that she transformed into a nightmarish 'THING' that I couldn't possibly describe in words without crying. 'IT' then picked me up and threw me off of the roof. When I fell to the ground, it hurt. It actually happened? Not likely, but when I came out of my delirium, I realised I was wandering around in my neighborhood and there was a huge gash on my head. I had lost alot of blood. I happened to have my cell phone with me, so I called myself an ambulance, in which they treated me for my injury and detoxed me safely with librium.<br>
<br>
Today I am alcohol free an happy.<!-- End Body -->
