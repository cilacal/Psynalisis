<!-- End DoseChart  -->
<!-- Start Body -->
White male, 37, I have a vast history of psychodelic traveling as well as having used many other drugs, primarily methamphetamine,  spanning over 20 years, last 8 years have retired from all the wildness, but I have collected many research chemicals. In the last 3 years I have once a month, picked a new reasearch chemical during that month.  As a general guide I take only mild or moderate dosages.  So far I have never had a bad experiance except with 5-MeO-DALT, due to a massive mistake weighing it out. (See my 5-MeO-DALT report called <a href='http://www.erowid.org/experiences/exp.php?ID=37775'>Disturbing the Priest</a> from Norin) <br/>
<br/>
The reason I tried this combination is that 2CT-4 makes my body feel very good and seems to increase thought processes without wild hallucinations, at mild doses anyway... the term 'Piggybacking' comes to mind. I love AMT but the body load is so heavy that I 'squirm' to get comfortable a lot. By the way I normally take about 80mg-100mg of AMT alone or 15mg of 2CT-4 alone. I made sure i took lower doses so that in the event that this was a stupid idea I wont suffer so much, assuming it doesnt kill me. I also have about 4 cups of coffee in my system, which may interfere with things a little and I smoke. (just in case some of you find that relevant) Also worth noting is that 2CT-4 seems to takes about 2 and a half hours to get me to peak and AMT about an hour and a half. The notes will be taken during this experiment. <br/>
<br/>
4:00 PM - Oral HLC powder AMT, 2CT-4 combined, started movie Vampires-Out for Blood, Purposely ate sandwich to slow the onset about 30 minutes ago. <br/>
<br/>
4:45 PM - First Alert. Noticable mild intoxication, feel hot although room temperature is 72 deg. <br/>
<br/>
5:00 PM - Body is feeling even hotter, butterflies in stomach. 5:15 PM - Body seems to be cooling a little, I am starting to feel a very very pleasant buzz. Movie is starting to annoy me, largely due to a bad actor, cant seem to hold interest in it real well and I have basically figured the whole thing out, not because of insight, but due to the excessive use of common vampire themes. Slight tactile elevation. Light feet and underarm perspiration. Almost feels like I am getting a abnormal build up of serotonin. The time it took to make this time entry seems to have been about 10 minutes, but I can see now that it has been 2 minutes, so time is starting to stretch. <br/>
<br/>
5:30 PM - Ok I just noticed I am much more empathetic to the movie characters. Colors are slightly more bright. I feel like I just went weightless as on a roller coster when you get that funny feeling in your stomach.. this is a sustained feeling at this point. Mouth is quit dry, but expected because of the AMT. I feel moderately stoned without the red eyes or lazyness ;) Movie has taken an unexpected turn, I am wrong, apparently I havent figured it all out. Im laughing at odd things, my endorphins have issues. <br/>
<br/>
5:45 PM - OH GOD THEY'RE EVERYWHERE, ok I'm kidding. Mydriasis very evident, music at end of this movie is clearly made by people on drugs. I dont seem to be getting any 'higher' but I feel great, if not slightly overheated. It has been my experience that the 'heat phase' of psychedelics is a precursor to onset of heavier intoxication. Like the calm before the storm. I have to say that I think the 2CT-4 is canceling some of the fun AMT (refractory) effects but I am going to assume I'm not hitting any peak yet. Not quite a ++ if I was guessing at this point. <br/>
<br/>
6:00 PM - If i could get rid of this overheating this would be great, I am not 'squirming' to get comfortable but man I am overheated. Going to take shower. 6:15 PM - Have been requested to go out with brother and see Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy. I will be an idiot and drive 5 miles, although honestly I'm still not at a ++ and have driven in much much worse states, shower helped a lot.  <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> <br/>
<br/>
10:45 PM - hit very strong ++ as movie got started (about 8:00) and at present is still there. Only the drive home seemed a bit difficult as I was quite certain I had a cop tailing me. But who knows or cares, I certainly dont, screw em all. There is still a hot feeling but has become more or less irrelavant. I feel great otherwise. Not to high, and not anywhere near base line. There was such a subtle come up that there was no rush to speak of or moment of panic. 2CT-4 appears to have done just what I thought it would to the AMT. I have no body tention or stress. There is however an amphetamine feeling to it, speedy but very soft and gentle, wish I had a good line of meth to go with this. Thoughts are very fluid and communication was very good with friends, however I had to keep my eyes out of direct line of sight because they were fully dilated and no one knew I was under the influence, at least I hope. Cut my doses in half and put it in a pill would be a great antidepressant. Reminicient of methylone, in fact aside from the body heat, is better than methylone. I have read others comments about 2CT-4 and I have to say the 'dark edges' are so identifiable that they bring no fear to the table, but are great for wisecracks, a tool if you will. <br/>
<br/>
The rock band KISS is a riot in this state, love it, it got me home. 15 minutes for this entry so far, but it seems to have gone by much much faster. A reversal of my previous mentioned time distortion. I really dont want to have this feeling fade but I have to do things at some point tomorrow and cant take more of the same no telling how long this is going to last. Both AMT and 2CT-4 have a long run time. Two shots of scotch coming up... but I'll probably have to take two more in a while, AMT is almost immune to alcohol after getting off, or so it has shown itself. So note that I am trying to take myself down slowly. I hate alcohol, yet what do you think I should take drugs to slow me down, come on... that would be wrong. Freaks. As I am reading this entry again I have noticed the text lines waving slowly, very peacefull and dare I say 'tender'. One thing I have noticed is that, aside from the amphetamine like influence, I can stop and start tripping at this level, completely controllable, although I find it hard to let go sometimes and ride it. Starting movie House of Flying Daggers.... more later... <br/>
<br/>
1:00 AM remembered I was writing this. <br/>
<br/>
2:30 AM I'm down... and sleepy.. good ride but a lot of overheating. In summary I'll have to find a better combination to takedown the AMT body load if I want to avoid the heat.<!-- End Body -->
