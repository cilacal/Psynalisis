So one day my girlfriend left her purse at my house. Being somewhat curious of her new ADD medication, I looked through it and found a bottle of 30mg Adderral XR, the yellowish capsules. Having never tried amphetamines before, I was quite nervous. I was afraid I would start cleaning the corners of my room with a toothbrush like in the commercials about meth. Nevertheless, I felt like it might be just what I needed to finish up work on my car.<br>
<br>
12:00PM : One 30mg pill swallowed with a glass of water. I go out to my 280Z project car and start playing around with the hoses and wires, like I always do.<br>
<br>
2:00PM : The onset took longer than I figured it would, but at around 2:00 I started feeling a strong headrush, and had a definite physical urge to smoke, so I went out and had a cig. And another, and another. <br>
<br>
3:00 PM : I was frantically working on my Z at this point. I felt I should inspect the rear brake drums, and repair as necessary. Fuck the Chilton's manual, I thought, I was going to do this my way. So in about 45 minutes I had the entire rear brake assemblies/axle/everything taken apart, and lying in my driveway. I figured this would be a good time to swap in a new differential. I go to pick up the differential, and decide it would be too much work, so I take the valve cover off of the engine, and decide I would like to perform a valve adjustment. Every tool was out, and I didn't feel like it. <br>
<br>
6:00 PM : The sun is beginning to set. I seem to think clearer, in a straight line, knowing exactly what I was doing. I got out the bottle of Armor-All and start shining up every inch of the interior of my Z. At this point, I remember that I need new brake calipers, so I decide to get on the computer and look them up on eBay. Unfortunately, I only made it to reading about 20th century mob bosses. Music sounded like a good idea, but after going through the first 5 seconds of around 30 songs, I gathered that I just wasn't in the mood.<br>
<br>
8:00 PM: It is now entirely dark out. I have a miner's light on my head, and start to 'work' on my car in the dark. I wouldn't necessarily call it work. More or less I was just fascinated with tearing things apart and learning about how they work. My head rush is still there, and I did not go in for dinner. I was having a cigarette about once an hour, way more than my usual 3-4 a day. <br>
<br>
11:00 PM: My car is a mess. Axles, rotors, calipers, vacuum tubes, everything scattered around and underneath my little sports car. I'm feeling somewhat tired, but at the same time sharp and alert. I focus my eyes on things I normally would take for granted. The cats in the yard, fighting over territory, the moonlight reflected off moist daffodils. Everything was connected. Everything, that is, but the parts that were connected to my car. I decide that it is getting late, and toss all of the parts into the hatch. Maybe I will finish it later, but who knows. <br>
<br>
Overall, the only thing that annoyed me about this drug was the teeth grinding, which I could stop, but would catch myself doing time and time again. Adderral is for ADD, something I don't quite believe in. It's primary goal is to cause the patient to focus. Well, I could focus, I could focus very well. Problem was, I would focus on one thing, then focus on something within it, or related to it, and not take the time to complete a task, as I was moving on to a new one almost as soon as I had begun the last one. I still take adderral from time to time, but more or less for reading, writing, and drawing. I slept well that night, the adderral had made me feel quite elated that day. nothing could go wrong. 1 Adderral; $0. Waking up to find your transmission in the front seat of your car; well, you know.<!-- End Body -->
