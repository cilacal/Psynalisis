It was the last summer of our childhood, and in a few weeks my two best friends and I would be going our separate ways.  We had Friend #1's house to ourselves for a weekend, and decided to spend the night together listening to music and playing games.  <BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:00<BR>
Around 7:30PM we entered the kitchen and decided to take the drugs that Friend #2 had brought for experimental purposes.  Friend #1 ingested 600mg of DXM, Friend #2 ingested 20mg of 5-Meo-DiPT, and I ingested both substances.  Friend #2 was an experienced psychonaut, and would be our guide through the coming confusion.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:10<BR>
We headed upstairs to #1's room, our usual hangout spot, and watched a few episodes of Family Guy on DVD.  <BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:40<BR>
During the second episode (approx. 30-40 min after dosing) we all began to feel the effects of the chemicals.  #2 reassured me that the 'body-buzz' I began to feel was a common occurrence and that if I needed to vomit, to do so, as I would feel better afterwards. <BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:50<BR>
Soon afterward intense nausea set in for myself and friend #1, and we both spent the better part of 45 minutes in separate bathrooms vomiting.  Before entering the bathroom I had not experienced any sort of hallucinogenic effect, but merely nausea and an intense 'body-buzz' in my legs and below my waistline in general.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:00  <BR>
While hunching over the cold toilet, clutching the bowl, and vomiting, I began to feel as if I were falling through space into the water.  The whole universe began to expand and contract into the tiny focal point of my head and the toilet.  It was as if my consciousness contained the universe as my mind focused and diffused.  The whole of creation became a singular entity, and all of existence was contained within the porcelain construct of the toilet.  I reached the first of several epiphanies that night, which was that 'God is a Toilet'.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:30<BR>
Friends #1 and #2 occasionally came by the door and asked if I was alright.  At one point, I snapped back to reality and told #1 I was, and crawled over to the bathroom door, which was slightly ajar.  As he looked in, I noticed the maroon rug on the floor in front of the sink, and became transfixed.  The carpet fibers appeared to be growing and I brought my head within a few inches of them. 'Dude! The rug! It's growing!' I exclaimed.  'Grow rug, grow!' He said back.  And we both stared at it for a moment.  We were both doing a little better, and rejoined Friend #2 in #1's room.  We all sat down on the futon and listened to the complete works of Led Zeppelin while watching Battery: Randomization in Media Player.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 1:40<BR>
The visuals on the computer were too much for me in my dissociated hallucinogenic state, and I once again felt as if the universe were compacting into the center of the psychedelic maelstrom that was the screen.  I snapped back to reality to perceive that I was the bridge between my two friends that night.  I sat in the middle and shared their unique experiences. #1 was logical and introspective, #2 was experiencing sensory and emotional overdrive, and I was overloaded with both introspection and sensory/emotional input. My second epiphany was that I was an experiential interpreter for my two best friends, and simultaneously had an understanding of the completely different thoughts and sensations they were both going through.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 2:00<BR>
I began to cry as the beauty of our collective friendship dawned upon me, and I wept that things would never be the same after that summer.  It occurred to me that we were spending one of our last nights together in the very same room that #1 and I had had sleepovers in since we were six years old.  Suddenly I was reliving those memories as if they were real. The wallpaper changed to the way it was years ago, and I was in the room as it was then, I said 'Dude! We're in our childhood!' and although #1 accepted this statement as valid, he didn't grasp my meaning.  I fell upward through the progression of our friendship in time, and related to them where and when I was.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 2:40<BR>
As we listened to Zeppelin, #1 told me how it was Jimmy Page that first inspired him to play guitar, and we reflected that we never would have had a band if not for Jimmy and Zeppelin.  The band was how #2 had become our friend, as he was our bassist, and we'd been together for four years. Music had been the glue of #1's and my friendship when we were in our early teens as well, as girl trouble nearly split us apart.  We thought about it and it occurred to us that without Jimmy Page there was no 'Us'.  My third epiphany that night came to us all as we shouted 'THANK YOU Led Zeppelin!”  If #1 had never heard Jimmy play, none of the past four years of amazing friendship and musical creation would have ever happened.  THANK YOU LED ZEPPELIN.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 3:10<BR>
After this conclusion, we all sat and listened with reverie to the sounds of Jimmy's revolutionary guitar, contemplating the significance of his music in our collective life.  I fell forward once again into the computer screen, and the universe warped accordingly.  My emotions filled my being, and expanded outward to fill all of existence.  All the love in the universe compressed into the microcosm of my head, blowing open the floodgates that were my eyes; and I wept once more, infinitely grateful to whatever made this life of mine happen and gave me such good friends and such a night of understanding.  We sat this way for eternity, as my consciousness dissolved into infinite love and psychedelic euphoria.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 4:30<BR>
I regained enough sense of self to want to leave the room and play a game online on my own computer in a room across the hall, and got up, but#1 and #2 pulled me back down and told me to stay.  They were right as I was in no state to be wandering off alone.  <BR>
T+ 4:45<BR>
I was quite disoriented, but began to feel the need to use the restroom, and managed my way into the bathroom, which #1 and I frequented over the next few hours as a result of diarrhea.<BR>
<BR>
We spent an hour or so attempting to play online, but none of us were able to muster the hand-to-eye coordination necessary, although we were all well past the peaks of our chemical experiences.  <BR>
<BR>
T+ 5:45<BR>
#1 decided it was time to head to bed, so we tried in our haze to figure out where we each would sleep.  As #1 crashed on the futon, #2 told him we would be alright and we'd get to bed soon too.  <BR>
<BR>
T+ 6:00<BR>
As I sat in front of my computer looking at #2 talking to me from the doorway, his face began to change from his own into someone else's, and I became suspicious that he wanted to take me to bed with him.  I attempted to make it clear that I would sleep in the water bed, and that he would sleep elsewhere. #2 seemed much more anchored in reality than myself at this point, and I complained to him that I hadn't seen the type of hallucinations that he had had.  I told him that I was a little dismayed that I hadn't seen any geometric patterns, and he told me that at one point he had seen six little devils assault his body.  I was a little jealous.  <BR>
<BR>
T+ 6:15<BR>
We then went into the room with the waterbed and I laid down to go to sleep.  After I closed my eyes, I saw a kaleidoscope of colors and shapes, and was pleasantly surprised by umbrellas and other random objects in semi-animated hyper-real detail against the kaleidoscopic background.  I commented to #2 who was playing on his computer in the room in which I slept about how I now understood the visuals, but couldn't make sense of his response. <BR>
<BR>
T+ ??:??<BR>
After an unknown period of time, I fell asleep.  I cannot place precisely when because I had my eyes closed for at least half an hour to enjoy the visuals and my dreams that morning had the same semi-animated hyper-real quality.<BR>
<BR>
Retrospective:  It's been over a year now since that experience, but the events of that night left such an indelible mark upon my mind that I shall never forget the details of my first and only experiment with 5-MeO-DiPT combined with DXM.  My friends and I look on it as one of the most mind-blowing experiences of our lives, and cherish that we share such an amazing bond.  The memory of the overwhelming emotions of love, brotherhood, and gratitude that we experienced, in concert with the discovery of how much we owe to chance our amazing life growing up together, has left us all with a greater appreciation for the intricacies of cause & effect, and the wonderful potential of these chemicals to bring such knowledge to light.<BR>
<BR>
