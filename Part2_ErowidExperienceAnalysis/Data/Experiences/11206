It was midnight, and I had a 10 page research paper worth 25% of my grade due at 12pm.  I started working on it, scouring the internet for sources to add to my document.  Around 5am, I just stopped working.  I was done, I had been up for 24 hours now, and hadn't had anything to eat for almost 12 hours.  I was all out of food and sick of the water fountain.  I was also about to pass out.<BR>
<BR>
To the right of me sits my bong.  That was the last thing I needed.  I decided a trip to the grocery store was necessary.  I put on my jacket and go outside; I had forgotten that it was snowing, but it wasn't a big deal.  I was so tired and hungry I didn't even feel the cold.  Once in the store, I searched around for some NoDoz or caffeine pills.  No luck.  I decided to look for a dietary supplement, because I knew those were full of a bunch of crap (caffeine) and not actual appetite supressants.<BR>
<BR>
Each dose (2 pills) contained 150mg of caffeine.  I immeadiately popped 5 pills (375mg) and made my way back to my residence hall.  I could feel it kick in right about as I was arriving home.  I no longer had a desire to eat from all the walking (I purchased and ate a bunch of chocolate, making me feel somewhat sick on the walk back).  The paper...I had to focus on the paper.  The paper wasn't happening.  My prior exhaustion (3-5 hours of sleep for the past week) on top of the caffeine was too much.  All I could manage to do was sit in front of my keyboard with a slight jitter.<BR>
<BR>
I decided it was hopeless, and crawled into bed setting my alarm for approx 3 hours later.  I got up and slapped together the rest of the paper in time, but it definitely was not my best work.  The moral of the story is: caffeine is not the cure-all to make myself  'alert'.  It made me feel sick and I had a lingering headache after the experience.  I probably shouldn't have taken that many pills, but I was used to taking my friend's Ripped Fuel regularly to stay awake on the weekends when I smoke a lot of weed late at night.<!-- End Body -->
