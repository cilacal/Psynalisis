<!-- Start Body -->
For sometime now I have been very interested in research chemicals and wanted to try one out. I first was compelled to try 2-ct-2 but after learning about its negative body effects, I was turned off. Then one day I began to pay attention to a little substance called 2C-I. Not much information has been created on this substance, but nearly all experiences have been positive. I then went through with ordering 100mg of this substance from an online company, hoping to get a taste of its potential. Though it took four days to arrive (and I bought express shipping!), I was eager enough to try 15 mg. My friend C was going to lend me his scale so I could get a safe measurement for six doses. But I couldn't get in contact with him. Unfortunately I am a very impatient person when I anticipate something for such a long time. My friend M and I used math and proportions to divide into what we thought was 15mg. This was a very foolish/risky thing to do, which I deeply regret being unaware of how much research chemicals I was putting into my body. <br/>
<br/>
We then got a call from my friend N who was curious about tripping. Ten minutes later N pulls up and we gave him a capsule. N was always interested when he asked questions about 2-CI before. For two hours we waited for the first wave but only 2 of us (Myself and N) were feeling anything. My friend M was angry that he wasn't feeling any effects yet and without my knowledge he insufflated a bump of 2-CI. Inside his room N and me felt a body buzz coming on so we got dressed in winter clothing that M had in his room. Outside was when then visuals appeared. The clouds were broken up, small, and spread apart, the perfect combination when you’re tripping. The sky began to appear like a conveyor belt of images, ranging at different speeds. Walking felt extremely different but not in a bad way. Ahead of me on the ground drops of oil on the road began to saturate and clump together. Without revealing anything about what I was witnessing, N turned to me with a smile and exclaimed he was seeing the same thing. This fast array of events had already revealed the drug's potential. <br/>
<br/>
I didn't know what to prepare for next and didn't care to prepare. I felt like a million dollars. I felt serene. The three of us then proceeded down to railroad tracks across the street. Nothing before could compel me to go to those train tracks since many homeless, alcoholics wandered them frequently. When we got there M started to feel it and began to experience color changes in the sky. When looking down the tracks, the rails seem to be persuading me to follow the path, much like the light at the end of the tunnel.  We continued down the tracks spending most of our time looking at the indescribably beauty in the sky. Shulgin suggested that he never felt anything to revealing or euphoric in the mind. I'd found the Holy Grail of euphoria. The night slowly crept on with massive visuals and an incredible sense of giddiness developed. This giddiness was very different than the one achieved from shrooms in that we were actually saying incredibly funny things. <br/>
<br/>
My mind could flow inside its own space or channel out into others conversations. Though stimulated, I felt complete mental clarity. No paranoia, no bad thoughts, no bad feelings. We spent the rest of the night walking around, lying around, riding in the bed of a truck, and going to a local supermarket. This substance possesses unique qualities that most other hallucinogens don't share. Near the end of the night we all had agreed this was the best thing each of had ingested, even better than x. We all decide the best name for this substance was Serenity. The purest feeling of Serenity was felt the whole duration. Those curious about hallucinogens would have a great time with this. Just be safe and have a great time with Serenity! : )<!-- End Body -->
