Well, let me first give back ground on the particular substances of which I will be speaking of. Amphetamines are sort of a love/hate relationship. I started trying meth 2 years prior to this. I found myself addicted about a year later. I got prescribed adderall xr starting at 15 mg daily and soon moved to 20, then 25. I continued using meth on and off, and only quit a few months before this. I have used amphetamines in pretty much every way imaginable, except I have not (and never will!) shot up. I would consider myself to be highly tolerant to amphetamines, unless I lower my dose for a week or so, or just go without for about a day or two.<br>
<br>
Vicodin is just a fun thing to do for me. I never have had much extensive studying of opiates, but I do enjoy them for the most part. However, I have TERRIBLE nausea! Mainly used for sleeping aid, but strangely it always has the reverse effect and oddly enough, I get REALLY horny on opiates. I had always thought that opiates would knock me out and cut off the possibility of sexual pleasure. I am willing to compare its effects on me to that of MDMA, which I have had innumerable experiences with. In general, ALL opiates FUCK me up. Like I am able to feel half of a vicodin to the point where it is externally noticeable because I get obnoxiously lazy and comfortable and tend to lay around.<br>
<br>
Anyways...<br>
<br>
I was at school in last period class. There was a sub, and I was bored and had a slight pain in my back, which occurs frequently due to a past injury, and I was in a good mood due to a very successful relationship (which now btw is over due to drugs...) and I wanted a fun time. Oh yes, it was also a Friday and I had nothing else planned. So I reached into my backpack and grabbed 2 pills and popped them in my mouth and downed them with water. <br>
<br>
30 mins later.<br>
I notice minor effects and get out of my seat and sit next to a friend, but on the floor. The sub didn't even notice. We just talked for about 5 mins and then both took the hallpass and went to the bathroom and I consumed 2 more pills. <br>
<br>
+30 mins<br>
Class is over and I am wandering outside looking for my buddy that I'll call Blue. Some background is needed on blue to understand how our relationship works. We did lsd together for our first time and had an AMAZING experience that changed our lives forever in MANY ways. He saved me from a meth/mdma overdose, and helped get me out of a longterm meth dependency. Pretty much, I trust him with my life. We are closer than most married couples (ya I know, its weird) and we usually can tell what the other is thinking.<br>
<br>
I find blue and when he sees me, he just laughs and asks what I am tripping on. I tell him whats going on and he laughs. He helps me get to a bench and we sit there and play cards until I can no longer hold my head up. I can't remember much else from this point onward in much detail. But I was peaking on my adderall at this time and I could feel it all over my body intensifying the effects of the vicodin. Around say 3 hours after the initial dose of vicodin, I was just out of it. I was so far out of reality that Blue constantly had to repeat the same phrases over about 5 times each just for me to comprehend them. And then I wouldn't know how to respond.<br>
<br>
The world felt so orgasmic and enjoyable. I felt purely euphoric and emotionally strong. I felt as though my relationship, with this other person whom we will call Orange, was perfect and that orange loved me and that everything in my life was perfect and couldn't go wrong. I texted orange, only to be denied of anymore satisfaction. Well, soon I forgot about their rude reply, and went back to that pretend world which I always long to go back to.<br>
<br>
Uggghhhh then the nausea hit me like a brick. I got up and bent over a trashcan which was near the bench because Blue had already brought it over when he first became aware of what I had taken. He really takes a lot of precautions, which is always wonderful because I am usually careless. So I was in luck that the trashcan was so conveniently placed in front of me for me to throw up in. ALL that I wanted to do at this point was throwwww up and get it over with! So when I discovered that I wasn't able to, I had the bright idea of spinning around in order to force myself to throw up. That just made the nausea really really really intense and I was forced to lay down until it calmed.<br>
<br>
My mom called pretty soon after and was wondering why I hadn't called and asked to get picked up yet. It was about 4 1/2 hours into the experience and Blue and I departed after he helped take me to the place where my mom was picking me up. She arrived and I got in the car and instead of going home she went the other way and said she wanted to get something to eat. Ughhhh that was the last thing I wanted to think about. The motion sickness of being in the car was already intensified and thinking about food made it way worse. Halfway to the place where she wanted to get food, I felt it coming and told her I needed to throw up. Instead of listening to me, she starts rambling about greasy food and saying 'oh you probably ate some burritos at school and they were just filled with fat and grease and now you're feeling it.' Wow, that did it! I grabbed the nearest paper bag and hurled in it. I opened the car door, got out threw out the bag, and threw up some more. Golly, that sure felt great though. That is the best part about throwing up, I feel excellent once it's over with! <br>
<br>
Other than that, we just went home I threw up some more, then went to bed. The next day I said I think I ate something bad at school. Overall, the experience was great. It might sound bad. But the level of euphoria and deep emotional stability and satisfaction that was attained was well worth it. However, the next day I was depressed, agitated, tired, and sore, with a pounding headache and some minor nausea. I can see how vicodin can be so habit forming in some. I know that if I had as much as I wanted, every time I felt bad I would just grab for that.<!-- End Body -->
