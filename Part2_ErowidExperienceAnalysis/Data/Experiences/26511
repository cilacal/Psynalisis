I aquired exactly 30 mg of 4-HO-DiPT (as a white powder) and divided it up by eye into three piles of ~10 mg each.  I was very precise with this, so I am pretty confident that the piles were equal.  Also, I knew it probably wouldn't hurt if I was off by a mg or two with this drug, so dividing by eye was prefered.<BR>
<BR>
The night began at a party (with few people I didn't know).  I had been happy to be back in town for a few days, so I figured it'd be a grand time to do some psychedelics.  I got out 10 mg of 4-HO-DiPT and put it into my drink.  A few people knew I was doing the drug (and they were not leaving), so they could help if something went wrong.  I put the 10 mg in my beer, shook it around a bit and drank it.  It tasted slightly bitter, but it wasn't horrible.<BR>
<BR>
After I'd finished about 3 beers I noticed a different feeling (other than alcohol intoxication), kind of a rush type feeling.  I talked with friends and basically got drunk the rest of the night.  I was being a bit more talkative than normally when I drink and that was about all I noticed until later.  It wasn't until I was pretty damn soused that I noticed anything from the 4-HO.  I closed my eyes and saw brilliant patterns.  Fractals of rounded squares.  Simply amazing checkerboard-ish patterns twinkling, all light-blue and orange on a black background.  I kept my eyes closed until something external caught my attention and then I was off to drunk land again.  The rest of the night is pretty hazy and I don't remember much (too much alcohol).  <BR>
<BR>
That's about it.  I'd like to take it without other drugs next time.<!-- End Body -->
