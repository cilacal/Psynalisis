Well I went to school and this kid gave me 10 caps I think they were eaither 150 mg's - 250 mg's. Well after 1st period I stoped and got a drink of water a took a cap. While I was in class I just got sleepy so I decided to take 1 more so after 1st period I went to one of my friends and hooked him up with one and I bought a water and took anouther cap. Then I said what the fuck and I took 1 more so I had taken 3 altogether we went to P.E. and while I was changing I wasnt feeling it so I took two more. We went to class and I started feeling real sick but I was chill so that people wouldnt know. Well that period past and I went to bio I was feeling real sick by then and my hands were shaking every outher minute everything would dissapear I was getting real scared so I asked my friend to just sit there and talk to me to calm me down so now everyone around me knew what was going on. When she had to sit down I really started freaking out and I ask the teacher if I could go to the office he let me go but I had to take my stuff with me and I was like trembeling so bad that I could barley put my stuff in my back-pack and everyone was looking at me. <BR>
<BR>
Instead of going to the office I went to look for someone to talk to cuz I was so scared. finally the bell rang and it was time for lunch and I found one of my friends and had him talk to me by this time if I sat down I would feel real sick and I guess it felt better to just walk and I could barley breath we went to the back of the school and I threw up twice. Not chunks or anything cuz the caps I guess had consumed all of my food so I was starving. When it was time for class I felt like cutting so that I could keep talking to my friend but he didnt want to so I just went to class and asked that kid how long it was going to last and he had no clue cuz he had never taken them before he was just able to tell me that I should have eaten before I took them and that I was only supposed to take two. Then I got the same feelings again and the kid next to me told the teacher that I was feeling sick so the teacher excused me and had the kid who gave me the pills escourt me. I went to the office and decided to call home and just say that I had a disgusting BLT. <BR>
<BR>
About an hour later my parent showed up and took me home. By this time I was real sick when she left the house I allowed myself to shake and I ate so that I could throw it up in an attempt to throw up the pills I had taken but it was too late so I was shaking and breathing funny and throwing up. I tried water bread u name it I ate it. I somehow managed to fall asleep and when my aunt came home I gave her the biggist hug knowing that I almost died if I hadnt decied to come home I would have died. I was drifting in class I dont know if you understand what I'm saying but I was blacking out in class.<!-- End Body -->
