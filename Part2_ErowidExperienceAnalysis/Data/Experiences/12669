Me and my roomie had never heard of AMT before the night we decided to try it with a bunch of people from our college. It was described to us as a mix of rolling and acid (the 'candy flip' as it was lovingly referred to). Since we are both pretty open minded individuals we decided to give it a whirl.  We took the pill at about 9 PM and then proceeded to go out and check out some parties on campus.<BR>
<BR>
After about an hour of hanging out I began to feel a little 'weird'.. it reminded me a little of the onset of E, but not quite the same at all. I basically couldnt describe it. I noticed my pupils becoming extremely dialated. My room mate was not yet feeling anything. After another hour we all seemed to be tripping pretty hard in 'waves'. We likened it to that because it seemed to constantly creep in on us in a somewhat of a rush sensation.. then decline and then come back even harder.. It was very intense, but extremely interesting and almost put us in a state of 'awe'. We all enjoyed painting with watercolors immensely and afterward seemed to stare at them for hours and watch the lines move and the different colors interact. This was not maybe 5 hours into our long( about 10-12 hour) trip.<BR>
 <BR>
The unfortunate part of my trip is that I happen to have an extremely sensitive, weak stomach. For the last 4 hours of the trip I could not stop throwing up.. I would throw up and afterward for like 5 minutes feel amazing and this incredible release, but... then the nausea would again take me over and I would continue to vomit. This made the last end of the trip a little rough and hard to bare at times because no one really wants to be throwing up in that mindset. I rode it out though and definately enjoyed the majority of the experiece.. it was intense, but not over powering. The last time I threw up would be the 5 pm the next day. I do not recommend this for anyone who is prone to stomach problems.<!-- End Body -->
