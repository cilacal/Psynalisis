<br>
I'm a daily pot smoker and have had experiences with the following drugs: LSD, Mushrooms, Cocaine, Methamphetamine, Amphetamine, MDMA, Benzos. It was my first time using 2C-B. Sorry for not getting enough details but I was severely damaged during that time.<br>
<br>
I was heading to an all-weekend party outside the city. I wanted to get some LSD but didn't find any so I purchased 2 x 250mg bags of powder 2C-B. I never tried this substance before but I read about it extensively so I knew the proper dosage and what was supposed to happen. On the way there (3 hour drive) I decided to try some of it. I wanted to take 25mgs but made a mistake in the process thinking 0,25g (250mg) equalled 25mg... I emptied about 3 quarters of the bag on a CD case and put the rest back into my pocket thinking that I should not start on a 25mg dose but less for the first time.<br>
<br>
All in all, there was about 200mg+ of 2C-B on that CD case. I then proceeded to lick all of it then took a sip of water and that was that. It was 8:20 PM at that time. About 15 minutes after ingestion I began to feel pretty weird and didn't understand why it was kicking in so fast. 10 minutes later I was fucked up and began getting nauseous. The rest of the ride took about 2-2.5 hours and I was in a different world. I was sweating like crazy, had bad cramps and severe nausea. When I would close my eyes I would see a different world full of swirling colors. I couldn't focus on anything in particular. An hour and a half after ingestion I had lost all touch with reality. In the few moments of lucidity that went and gone I realised that I either took too much (impossible... There was 25mg in the bag... Or so I thought) or it was a different substance. I remembered about the bromo-dragonfly incident that was sold as 2C-B-fly and major panic and anxiety set in.<br>
<br>
I was in a tunnel at one point that was rotating and I could see the road at the end of it. The lights from the cars dash were moving around and pulsating towards my face. I did not remember how I got there and tried to rethink my steps. It was like being in a movie where you forget the beginning. The body load was extremely uncomfortable and I asked the driver to pull over. The other people in the car didn't know the awful state I was in. I got out of the car and all I wanted to do was lay in the snow and go to sleep as the effects were more manageable with eyes closed. A friend from another car who snorted a tiny amount of 2C-B earlier looked at me in shock. He told me my hair was all 'exploded' and I had a severely morbid and fucked up look on my face. I couldn't really talk about it and all I was able to mutter was that I was extremely fucked up and took more then half a bag. I was really getting pissed off if I was asked other questions and couldn't really talk. My friend told me I took way too much and that you can make like 10 doses from that bag. I had a moment of regained lucidity and had an Aha moment. I knew there was nothing I could do about it and got back in the car as I was very dizzy, sweaty and it was like -3 deg C outside.<br>
<br>
From this moment the details of the rest of the trip are pretty vague. I thought I was going to die and was trying to survive the whole thing. I had some moments of lucidity when the hallucinations and body load stopped and I remembered that I read about 2C-B being permissive about overdoses and that all I had to do was sleep it off and wait for it to subside. So I set a goal of surviving until they reached the house and I could go crash on a bed.<br>
<br>
These moments of lucidity were few and scarce though. Mostly I couldn't remember who I was and what I took. I couldn't remember if I was born. I had massive flashing lights inside my head that seemed to head me somewhere. Then I saw the road again and it was all a big blur of headlights spinning and pulsating away. The orange BMW dash was getting very painful visually to look at. Strange thoughts and flashbacks of my life were seen. I remember thinking about my mother at one point and was very very sad. Then I couldn't remember who I was again and tried desperately to put my thoughts and the chain of events in order but I couldn't remember. Did I really take this drug? Am I still alive? Where am I going? Will I die? Why are these people with me? Was I always in this state? And many others I can't recall. During this time I was mostly with my eyes closed and hallucinating intensely. The nausea and body load was awful. It felt like I swallowed a big rock that was moving inside of me and pushing on my organs. My heartrate was probably thru the roof but I don't really remember checking it. The road being extremely curvy (mountain road) didn't help either and I tried throwing up a few times in a desperate attempt to feel better but couldn't.<br>
<br>
I remember getting completely pulled out from the world I was in. I felt sad and alone. No one could help me and I didn't want any help. The world I was in was beautiful and full of amazing colours. The music felt like a silk sheet on a windy day surrounding me completely. I was seeing the people in the car like thru a fisheye lens but couldn't really focus on anyone or anything in particular. Whenever I opened my eyes the body load seemed to intensify and it got better when I closed them to return to 'my world'. All I wanted to do was sleep. Can't remember much else from this point.<br>
<br>
It was 11:40 PM. The car stopped suddenly and it was like someone snapped his fingers in my ear. We got here, they said. I was like oh shit, now I can sleep, I'm gonna live. The body load was better at this point and I felt like I was slowly returning to normal. I was still in a state of utter confusion though. I got out of the car and headed to the house. There were alot of people and friends there and I said hi but I think they could see I was pretty fucked up. I couldn't stand up for long and dizzyness and confusion set in. I found some steps and one of my friends from the car took me to a room with this giant bed in the middle. I crashed there and things got better from then on.<br>
<br>
I was lying there with my eyes closed and an intense state of relaxation and peacefulness surrounded me. I had survived and was really happy and relaxed. The visuals had disappeared and I felt the slow return to baseline. This relaxed and 'always with a smile on my face' continued for about 4 more hours. It was ~12am or so I think and I ingested the stuff at around 8:20 pm or so. It seemed like an eternity had passed though.<br>
<br>
The next day I took a regular dose (more than 25mg though) and felt great, laughing hysterically. Always get your dose right people! This shit is really strong when u fuck up and can send your mind straight to hell. If you ever had high fever as a kid, like 42C+ you can relate to how I felt and the hallucinations I had. When u have 42-43C fever you are very close to dying and hallucinate intensely. So.. Be careful with the dose and enjoy. 2C-B is a very fun substance.<!-- End Body -->
