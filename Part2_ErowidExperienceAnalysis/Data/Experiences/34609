The following is an account of a friend having a bad trip on 2C-I.<BR>
<BR>
2 friends and myself decided to try this new drug that was billed to us as “super ecstasy”. I dosed at about 4:30 pm and my friend at about 5:30. The actual amount of the dose is unknown. We dosed by dipping a drinking straw into the vial and placing the contents on a piece of bread, folding and swallowing. The powder filled about 1/3 of a centimeter of the end of the straw. <BR>
<BR>
After about an hour we started feeling X style effects. This was good. We played music and hung out. At about 3 hours into it we discovered this was more like acid and not a rave drug. Visuals became prevalent and the body buzz intensified. At bout 8pm my friend started tripping bad and wigging out. He curled up in a fetal position in the floor, flaring his arms and legs, and started talking nonsense. We got him onto the couch where he proclaimed “Something’s gone wrong. GET IT OUT!!!” then started screaming uncontrollably for 15 min. He continued to peak for about an hour during which he couldn’t keep still. His eyes rolled back in his head and he began to convulse. He begged me not to leave him and to help him through this. At this point I started to get scared. I remember thinking “Oh my god, im gonna have to take him to the hospital”, and “if he dies… what do I do?” He begged me to make it stop but there was little I could do. I stayed with him and tried to convince him that everything was all right, and that everything was in his head. This was the first time he had eaten anything trippy and he was not ready for the experience. <BR>
<BR>
Finally I found the solution to his bad trip…. The Beatles. After listening to “Hey Jude”, “I am the walrus”, and “Lucy in the sky with Diamonds”, and reminding him that he was mellow his peak broke into a nice trip with fun visuals. Its now about 10pm. We relaxed and reflected on the trip and everything went well from there. By 1am we were able to sleep and put that behind us. <BR>
<BR>
The moral of the story… Don’t take this substance unless you are mentally ready, in a safe place, with safe people, and know EXACTLLY how much you’ve eaten as it doesn’t take much.<!-- End Body -->
