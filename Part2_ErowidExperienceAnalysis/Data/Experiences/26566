I was with one friend and a group of people I didn't know very well in an unfamiliar setting.  I was warned beforehand that AMT sometimes causes nausea, so I was a little nervous about that.  I made sure I knew where there was a bucket I could throw up in, just in case.  I did not know much about the substance, so was going in without any particular expectations.  I was not on any OTC meds or supplements at the time.  I had significant prior experiences with medium and high doses of LSD, as well as familiarity with several other psychedelics.<BR>
<BR>
I took 18 mg of AMT orally.  After about an hour, I had the sudden urge to wander around and felt extremely energetic.  I took a brisk walk for maybe fifteen minutes, and then decided it was time to have a seat.  For the next hour, I felt chatty and friendly towards the people I was just meeting, and things all seemed a bit more 'vivid' visually.  I was at one + or so.<BR>
<BR>
I had one drink at about the 3 hour mark, and was still energetic and felt like dancing to some music, but had begun to feel much less talkative.<BR>
<BR>
At about the 3.5 hour mark, I hit ++.  There was speculation that this was potentiated by the alcohol.  There were no open-eye visuals during the experience, aside from the sense of vividness.  For a while, I could see some very faint closed-eye visuals - tightly interlaced patterns that slowly shifted.  Around this time I started to feel excessively mellow - at any point I sat or lay down, I had no urge to move at all.  It was as if my inertia had increased: when I sat, I did not want to stop sitting, and when I moved around or was standing, I didn't want to sit.<BR>
<BR>
This got pretty boring after a couple hours.  I snorted 25 mg of MDMA at about the 6 hour mark.  Everything appeared very lush at that point, and I got some of the typical empathic MDMA feelings.  I remember being enthralled with the way lights looked behind fabric.  However, I was also full of inertia and barely felt like talking with anyone, so I simply sat, observed, and listened (for the most part).  I felt a bit of jaw clenching after the MDMA.<BR>
<BR>
I went back down to + around the 9 hour mark, and lingered there.  I felt tired but not sleepy.  I got a couple of hours of restless sleep, and finally felt like I was at baseline around the 15 hour mark.<BR>
<BR>
I stayed up for several more hours after baseline and felt lucidly introspective, and thought through a lot of things about myself and how I relate to people and things in my life.<BR>
<BR>
I luckily did not experience nausea at any point.  During the main part of my AMT experience (the 2.5 - 9 hour mark), I felt like I was coming down off of LSD but without any negative body load.  I never felt any 'peak' persay.  I also never felt like I wasn't myself, or like my ego was affected in any real way.<BR>
<BR>
It was an interesting place to go, but annoyingly long for such mild effects (probably because of the low dose).  From what other people have told me about AMT, I might be interested in trying it again at a higher dosage, but it is a significant time commitment.<!-- End Body -->
