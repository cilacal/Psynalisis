As an avid devotee of LSD for the past 25+ years, it is only in the past 5 years that I have become aware of various other entheogens that are still legally accessible in the USA.  I recently went to a party where I had the opportunity to try alpha-methyltryptamine for the first time.  I had heard and read various reports about AMT but didn't really go into the experience with any particular expectations, having had enough other experiences in times past that didn't always fit the textbook descriptions.<BR>
<BR>
After taking 30 mg orally around 3PM, I waited for about 30 minutes before noting any activity, starting as a vague restlessness that gradually turned to increasing nausea over the next couple of hours.  I felt it was time to start unloading the contents of my stomach before it became involuntary.  The nausea continued to mount over the next 15 to 20 minutes and I vomited a second time, a little more forcefully and a little less voluntarily, then the nausea subsided.<BR>
<BR>
During this time, I became increasingly aware of my senses and developed a pleasant sense of euphoria, much like I had experienced with psilocin on other occasions.  I had been told that I would likely turn my thoughts inward, but I was in a social mood and engaged in conversations with my friends.  Visual and tactile perception were notably enhanced.  My surroundings appeared bright and shiny with a bit of yellowing, but there was not a lot of spatial distortion and none of the auditory sampling and remixing that I typically experience with LSD.  There was some acceleration of thought processes and an increase of associations, but no feeling of things being in a runaway out-of-control state.  My sense of time was only mildly dilated.  Coherent conversation was still easy at this level.  There was a tendency to feel speedy--I could have engaged in physical activity--but I had no difficulty in remaining still instead.  All in all, it was a very pleasant state.<BR>
<BR>
After about 4 hours, I was confident that I had a feel for the curve of AMT's ramp-up and decided that it would be interesting to explore the addition of Salvia Divinorum.  Having experienced full-blown Salvia journeys in the past, I decided it would be best to take a more moderate approach until I was familiar with the results.<BR>
<BR>
It is difficult to describe the trip to those who have experienced other entheogens but who have never encountered Salvia.  My experience has been that it is unlike anything else out there.  For me, a single smoked hit of 10X concentrated Salvia results in a very strong sense of eternity: timelessness and deja vu.  There is a sensation of going out of body, a feeling of nakedness before the universe which seems to turn with a counter-clockwise rotation, greatly enhanced tactile sensations with an increased sense of sexuality, and a sort of 'flapping' as though passing through a series of doors opening and closing; doors that connect one moment/place/event/world to the next.  The edges of objects take on the appearance of a moving wavefront.  <BR>
<BR>
I myself feel as though my presence in the conventional physical world is a very thin edge, behind which is the 'real' me.  I have also experienced a dualism of insight and deception, with the desire to move about physically in order to investigate/prove/disprove the thoughts at hand.  This is not a good idea: Salvia can be very disorienting, causing one to lose one's balance and perhaps break objects, cause injuries, and otherwise attract unnecessary attention to oneself.  I highly recommend suppressing this urge and staying put until things appear more conventional again!  It can be very helpful to have someone on hand to remind you that no matter how things seem, there is no need for alarm and things will start to return to 'normal' after a few minutes.  (A single 5X hit produces these results for me on a much milder scale, a bit reminiscent of Cannabis.)  I would definitely recommend becoming well-acquainted with Salvia alone before doing what I did next whilst tripping on AMT:<BR>
<BR>
I smoked a one-hitter loaded with 5X Salvia concentrate and awaited the result.  Within moments, the familiar characteristics of Salvia interwove themselves with the AMT, creating a very pleasant and mellow time/space perception.  The best way I can describe it is that the Salvia and the AMT approached each other at right angles, the AMT from the left and the Salvia from the right, intersecting to form a violet-banded quilt of time/space.  Even in this state, I didn't feel incapacitated, apprehensive, or paranoid.  This might not be true for someone unfamiliar with Salvia, though.<BR>
<BR>
The Salvia stayed with me for about an hour, after which it was imperceptible.  I smoked some more Salvia a couple of more times through the night, with similar results and duration.  <BR>
<BR>
By about 3AM (12 hours after taking the AMT), I was having some interesting visual flares from the AMT, finally fading out enough by 5AM that I was able to sleep.<BR>
<BR>
A few of my friends that evening also tried this experiment and the verdict was unanimous (even from one fellow who had doubled his dosages of both):  If you enjoy AMT and Salvia Divinorum separately, the combination is not to be missed!<!-- End Body -->
