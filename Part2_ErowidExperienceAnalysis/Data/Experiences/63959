<!-- Start Body -->
I first must state that I am an experienced tripper and was well prepared for this trip. I currently am on 50mg of Seroquel at night for anti-psychotic reasons. I also take 60mg of Ginkgo Biloba extract twice a day for its vasodilating properties.<br>
<br>
I traded a bunch of pills for 30mg of 2C-B which I got from a friend. It was the first time ever handling the substance and I was very excited to try a new drug as I had not done so in quite some time. To prepare for my experience I did some simple mind calming rituals (deep breathing, stuff like that). I believe being calm and collected before a trip helps maximize the experience while also cutting down the chance that I have a bad trip.  I had some sedatives at hand if a starting freaking out, and had my Seroquel in case I needed to end the trip right away (It would knock me the fuck out). I put about 20mg of powder into some apple sauce and ate it, it was very bitter, tasting like MDMA powder. After that I went down to my basement to wait for the effects to begin. I ingested the powder at roughly 9:35 PM. At 11:15 I still had not felt anything besides some mild stimulating effects. At this point, pissed that I might have gotten ripped off, I ingested the rest of my 2C-B (about 10mg). <br>
<br>
About 15 minutes later, I started feeling very hot, kinda like a was coming up on some MDMA. I felt a strong urge to go outside and walk around. My sister was sitting on the steps talking on the phone. I told her that I must go connect with nature and starting walking toward the highway by my house, feeling that if I went this way I would see something beautiful. I was not to be disappointed, the sky had taken on a purple/pink hue and was amazing to look at. A huge electrical tower looked like some god standing over me, looking down with pity at me for not being able to see what he could see. At this point it felt as if I had taken low doses of Ecstacy plus some LSD, but there was some other component that I could not quit put my finger on. I also felt a general feeling of confusion, somewhat like being stoned without the disassociation from mind and body.  I walked back to my house to let my sister know that I was ok, and to get some water and check my pupils. Yup, they were fully dilated, and my face and body were very red. Body temperature  was slightly elevated as was my blood pressure and heart rate. I grabbed a bottle of water and decided to walk to the park near my house. <br>
<br>
As I was walking to the park I noticed that sounds were much more ominous and somewhat foreboding (but not in a bad way?). A great mettle clang sounded above me, and I jumped about 10 feet in the air before realizing that it was only the building next to me. When I got to the park there were two lovers sitting on a bench talking to each other. I immediately felt a surge of affection for both of them, even though I didn’t know them, realizing that all of humanity is connected. I smiled and waved as I walked by them. I lounged on the hill and stared up at the stars, I was not prepared for what I saw.<br>
<br>
I looked as if the cosmos were rearranging itself just for me. Stars glowed different colors and switched places with one another, sometimes shooting off into the distance, only to be replaced with another star from another galaxy. The night sky pulsed with different colors, changing from blue to green to a dark purple and back again. The grass below me shifted and waved, seeming to become a part of me. I came to the conclusion that nature is all consuming, that it is there for us, and that we should share it and respect it. I stared at the sky for about an hour.<br>
<br>
I went down onto the playground and sat at the end of a slide. I picked up some wood chips and a feeling of sadness and loss such as I’ve never felt hit me. I could feel the empty husk of what used to contain life within it, only to be striped of that life and to be used by man to create its own society. A train sounded somewhere in the distance, its sound echoed through my head. I became very angry at humanity, what right did we have to shape and warp nature for our own benefit and amusement? I also became angry at our government, what right did they have to tell us what we can and cannot ingest? It is our own body and our own life. At this point I began coming down from my peak, it was about 1:45 AM. I was filled with an all consuming urge to eat, as if I hadn’t eaten in days. Also at this time I got some mild stomach discomfort, which was only bothersome if I thought about it. I was filled with complete bliss as I made my way back to my house. When I got back to my house, I poured myself a bowl of cereal and sat down to watch some TV. Southpark was on and was extremely funny. By this time most of the visuals were finished, only some brightening of colors and some shifting of objects. I also noticed some very powerful sexual feelings, though I had no desire to follow through with them. I put on That 70's Show, which was extremely relaxing. All the cliche 70's furniture and colors were fun to look at. At about 3:00 AM I took 75mg of Seroquel to help me sleep, I had to be up in 3 hours for summer school (yikes). Sleep was a long way off and I didn’t doze off until around 4:00 AM.<br>
<br>
The next day: <br>
Today I feel fine, no bad after effects. I feel great to be alive and apart of this world we live in.<br>
<br>
Conclusion:<br>
2C-B is by far the best drug I’ve ever done (and I’ve done a lot of them). I would for sure do it again. Just as a reminder to people, be safe, know your drug and have fun. As a precaution I like to have some type of sleep aid or sedative at hand just in case something goes wrong and I start freaking out.<br>
<br>
Peace.<!-- End Body -->
