Previous experience: mushrooms, DPT, DMT, 2ct-2, DXM<br>
<br>
Setting: comfortable, clean college dorm room with friends<br>
<br>
An important note: 40mg of DPT was snorted about 5 hours prior. Effects had worn off, but small traces of chemical may have produced a synergistic effect.<br>
<br>
A saturday evening me and a few friends decided to attempt a breakthrough salvia experience.  This was my first time using salvia and I was very excited. I initially took one fairly large hit of Saliva 5x from a gravity bong. The effects were present, but somewhat mild.  It felt similar to coming up on a mushroom trip.  Disorientation, small body buzz, slightly psychedelic mind patterns. But nothing too remarkable. Effects subsided after 15 minutes and I decided to smoke some Salvia combined with a little 5-MeO-DMT.  (I have smoked 5-meo-DMT dozens of times and am quite familiar with its effects) <br>
<br>
We packed a decent sized (maybe .2g?) of Saliva 15x in a normal bong and added about 10-15mg of 5-meo-DMT (eyeballed). The hit was ignited with a butane torch rather than a lighter to allow hotter temperature and more chemical vaporization.  The hit was split between me and a friend.  I received the second and probably weaker part of the hit.  I held the hit in as long as I could (about 7-10 seconds) and exhaled slowly.  As I was exhaling I could already feel the effects: Intense warmth and body buzz accompanied by a rush of energy, it felt like my whole body had lost circulation but was regaining it at a fast speed.  <br>
<br>
I started to dance to the gypsy kings music that was playing. I felt immediately propelled into an alternate state of consciousness. It felt like I fell asleep and just started dreaming. Slightly similar to a good dream in REM sleep. At first I was unaware of anything and all i could focus on was the energy of the music and the dancing. After about 30sec-1min I became self aware. This state was characterized by a feeling of comfort and nostalgia, dissassociation yet self awareness( I felt that I was in an alternate universe, but I still maintained the knowledge that I was still in my dorm room). Colors became much more vivid and crisp.  I felt like I was having a very pleasant, lucid dream. Open eye visuals were colorful and stimulating, but somewhat mild.  Closed eye visuals were very intense. Probably some of the most intense I've ever experienced. Vivid geometric patterns and archetypes. I could control these visuals at will and could project myself from one reality/fantasy to the next. This continued for about 10 minutes or so then the trip tapered off quickly.<br>
<br>
Most psychedelics Ive done (shrooms, 2Ct2, dpt, etc) seem to have comparable effects. Salvia was unlike any of these.  Im sure the 5-MeO-DMT added to the experience as I could taste it in the smoke.  But the majority of the feeling was definately Salvia. This substance is very energetic.  Good, positive feelings, nice warm tingling and body buzz, dreamlike qualities.<!-- End Body -->
