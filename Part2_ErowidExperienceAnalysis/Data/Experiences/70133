It all started out one day when my friend (J) was having a get together at his house. Around nine people came in total including me and my half brother. Prior to this I had bought a reasonable sized bag of dried mushrooms (which I researched and found them to be the Fly Agaric type.) from a sex shop near by.<br/>
  <br/>
When I finally got to his house (at around three o’clock) I let myself in, and walked up to his room. Everyone was huddled around a water bong (hookah) and they were crumbling hash onto fruit tobacco and smoking it. I decided I would have a try seeing that I’ve seen pictures of my sister and her friend s smoking it. She said it was great fun! And it worked well. .. Although they used milk instead of water for the bottom half which was manky to look at (it tinged a red-ish colour with green dots). <br/>
<br/>
The time was now four o’clock & I decided it was the right time to eat the shrooms seeing that there was little hash left and I was bored. At that time I was unsure of how many shrooms to eat & since they cost thirty euro I was wary of giving any away… so I downed all of them at once (now knowing that was a very stupid thing to do) j gave me some coke to take away that horrible mushi taste!<br/>
<br/>
Time went by & we all decided to head down to the shop for some skins and fags. Me and my friend p skated while the rest walked. P & me got to the shop ahead of everyone else so we decided to just buy the fags and skins & meet back up with all the rest. Surprisingly I got served (I’m only 15 & don’t look old)<br/>
<br/>
Upon heading back to J’s house I started to feel the shrooms creep up on me! It felt like a light dxm trip (125mg), my skating improved as I felt I was watching myself!! When we all met up and reached the house the ground felt like it was gone all wavy or something and I lost my good sense of balance. Everyone laughed when they saw me stumble around. The trip was rapidly getting more intense which was worrying because my vision was very fucked! my vision was limited to a circle & I could not wipe the smile off my face!! That was one of the better features of the trip! Anyways time passes and I was getting extremely paranoid to the point at which I thought everyone was tricking me. Every time anybody laughed at me I would get really serious and punch them! So I closed my eyes only to find I could see caves and rock patterns this was cool but again freaky …<br/>
<br/>
At around six o’clock time was going so slow and my memory of the next two hours is very fuzzy. my friends said I was hallucinating and shouting curse words while running and falling everywhere. From that point on I lost touch with the world and was twitching like someone epileptic. I saw time and space and felt words & chased colours and phrases until I woke up in a hospital bed. I felt like I was in a coma for hours. My mum sister dad and half brother were all standing over me looking very worried. I was very confused and babbled a bit. The doctor hooked me up to an iv  and injected me with lorazepam. It made me sleepy and I felt no pain I cant remember much more of that night but my parents told me about it the next day along with some lectures about drugs.<!-- End Body -->
