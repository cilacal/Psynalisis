This story is about my first experience with 2C-B. It was a very troubling experience as I accidentally consumed the drug thinking it was MDMA. I was at a party and throughout the night consumed mild doses of cocaine, MDMA and speed. During the night some guys had taken some very strong 2C-B and were tripping very harshly, often acting aggressively. The drug was taken off them by the host of the party and then given to J. J is a friend of mine. At about 7 o’clock in the morning J offered me a line of MDMA. I was pretty sober at the time so agreed. <br/>
<br/>
It was not until after J, another friend B and I all snorted our lines that we realised something was wrong. As a waved my hand across my face I knew something was different as my hand seemed to move in slow motion while pulsating. It was then J realised that he had mixed up his bags and we had just snorted about 8 doses of 2C-B between the 3 of us. Being quite inexperienced with psychedelics only having consumed mushrooms, I was unsure of what to expect and was quite fearful of the repercussions of our actions. The party was in an artist’s workshop and all around me the colourful patterns on the walls seemed to be moving in circles. I decided to have a shower and found another friend and quickly explained what had happened as things where becoming dark very quickly.<br/>
<br/>
During the shower I started vomiting and convulsing. After about 20 minutes I was dressed by a friend and fed a valium to calm down. Once the valium took effect I started to regain some control. My memory was very affected at the time, as I had to keep asking friends what had happened and why I was still tripping so hard. After about 40 minutes I met up with my friend J who seemed to be at about the same level as me. We sat down on the floor of the workshop and began to enjoy the trip. <br/>
<br/>
The visuals were amazing as we began drawing pictures, the colours appeared to merge and move. I found it very hard to follow other people’s conversations, as they all seemed to be going around in circles with people constantly repeating themselves. I found this would come in waves, as I would first notice people talking in circles then they would talk in high-pitched voices. It was after these voices that the visual trips would fully kick in as we smashed up crayons to use the powder to finger paint. Music seemed to ebb and flow with the trip. It was playing constantly but I would only hear it occasionally and it seemed to be playing from very far away, really only a few meters.  <br/>
<br/>
After about 3 hours we decided to leave the workshop and walked around the garden. By now it was about 10 in the morning. The trip had started to die down but I was left while a euphoric buzz similar to MDMA. The rest of the morning was spent slowly cooling down after our somewhat unfortunate accident.  <br/>
<br/>
The whole experience left me with mixed feelings as I barely remember any of the bad reaction to the drug. But from what friends tell me it was quite a brutal OD with an ambulance nearly called. While the trip had spectacular moments it was not worth what my friends had to go through. It has been said that 2C-B trips are just as intense for the carer [sitter]. I felt this as after the experience I felt much closer the friends that had helped me through the darker parts of the trip.  <br/>
