Since the very first time i had heard of research chemicals, i had wanted to try them very much.  One day a friend of mine told me about a site that you could order several chemicals from.  i didnt really have too much of a preference with which one to get, but he wanted to get 2c-i.  he described to me that it was very similar in chemical structure to mescaline, and also that there was an mdma type of effect as well.  the order came about 5 weeks later.<br>
     <br>
I decided that i would buy a digi to weigh out the doses.  i planned for the digi to go over 2 decimal places.  .02 would equal about 20mg which i read was the preffered dose.  the only digi i could find only went over one decimal place, so i planned to weigh out .1g which would equal 5 doses that i could split up.  it didnt work out that way.  the shits way too sticky or something because it didnt register at all on my digi.  <br>
<br>
<span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span><br>
<br>
For my first dose, i just smeared some on my finger and put it on my toungue.  it took about 1 hour and a half to kick in.  there were nice trails and some dots of color, but the visuals were very minimal.  the mdma like effect i found to be very nice.  i felt love towards everything.  since it has an mdma like effect, its a stimulant so sleeping was not possible that night.<br>
     <br>
The next time i dosed, i put the 2c-i in a vitamin c pill that i had broken apart.  im not sure if vitamin c potentiates the trip at all, but i figured it wouldnt hurt.  i took one 1000mg vitamin c pill after taking the dose of 2c-i.  im sure i did a lot this time, however i dont have much of an idea on how much i took.  i had eaten that day so it took very long to kick in.  aproxamintly 2 hours and 15 minutes.  <br>
<br>
The first thing i notice was a slight speedy feeling, folowed by very very faint dots of color.  i occasionally checked my pupils until they finally showed signs of dialation.  the visual trails were more intense this time, and i enjoyed them very much.  there were slight shapes that were very faintly colored.  they looked kinda like interlocking eyes. this night i found it very hard to sleep but managed to get a little bit of sleep eventually.  <br>
     <br>
I also found out that tripping 2 days in a row is possible, unlike most of the other hallucinogenics that im aware of.       <br>
     <br>
I belive that 2c-i is a lot of fun, however i dont think it as is potent as i thought it had been made out to be.  im not dissapointed at all though.<!-- End Body -->
