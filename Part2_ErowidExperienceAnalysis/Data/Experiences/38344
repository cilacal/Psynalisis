So my friend aquired some 2cb from some ppl he knew from back in the day. About a gram of powder in a glass vile. We divided up a 100mg weighed out section into 3 parts for me my friend and his brother. We emptied out some capsules of some echinacea crap cleaned them with Q-tips and filled them with what we call 'chemicals' the name we gave 2cb. <br>
<br>
 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span> <br>
<br>
5 minutes after ingestion I remember seeing the ceiling have a weird water bed effect like a mild visual off lsd and remember thinking of my lsd trip during the winter. I got some safety and comfort from this familiarity but realized it had only been 5 minutes. I don't really remember what happened the next 30 minutes<br>
<br>
I rememebr hearing a loud buzzing that got really loud real fast then back down again, from a wisper to a jet engine by my face. I went upstairs to go throw up and looking down at the roud toilet everything became round. Bottles of lotion and knobs on the faucets were round and solid colors. these visuals were way diff than anything Ive seen before. there were also intense patterns. Tribal arrows and flowers on everything movings and pulsating. I actualy thought everything around me was living and very earthy. not like shrooms tho but sum strange erie life form. <br>
<br>
Soon after I went downstairs and continued to puke in a bucket. I was handling myself well but my body wasnt. after that it was Id hafto say the most intesne trip ive ever experienced. Id compare it to 30 hits of acid. I knew the floor was cluttered with crap but it was a solid purple with no objects. a weird concave bowl shape like it was sinking in the middle. my friend nicks face was sprouting tribal patterns. I remember thinking he got tattoos or something. they moved and twirled and grew and I remember seeing a red glow on him and then he looked like a demon I thought. but not in a scary way at all. <br>
<br>
a cheech and chong move was on tv and i glimpsed at a part of cheech coming out of a car with streams of light emitting form nething on the tv that moved. it cudnt tell if the patterns were already on tv or if that was me trippin off this shit. i got sum dry mouth and asked for sum water and my friend went upstairs to fetch me a glass. i drank it down and then thought it was warm and turned on a fan. I thought it was cold and turned it off then got thirsty again . More water fan on fan off more water. Fan on fan off water. <br>
<br>
what I had thought had been a few hours of turning finding comfortable palces on the couch was actualy no more than a few minutes. the scene on tv was still the same. cheech and chong were smokin the same joint. my friend looked tired from fetching water. The wall to my left looked like it turned to a latex sheet. It looked like sumone pressed a giant chamelon up against it form the other side and it changed the color of the wall where it touched. <br>
<br>
I tried to read the time again but now it was out of focus it looked like looking thru some weird textured glass. everything was refracted weird and the glass on the tv looked broken. It looked like everything was seen thru a broken glass window. I stayed up all night and in the morning i asked my friend and his brother if they had seen what I did and we all shared the same weird trip with the same effects. <br>
<br>
We took it again a few days later but only 25mg and none of us had the same trip. I don't know why. the other 2cb trips were more mellow with beautiful patterning and was how it was always described online. could 33 be the magic number? has no one else had this experience with a first time 2cb trip? (this in no way was a bad trip. the few words that made sense when I was on this was 'fukin sweet we need more of this chemicals'.<!-- End Body -->
