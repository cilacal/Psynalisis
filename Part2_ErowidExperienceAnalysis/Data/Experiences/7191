I suppose we've all heard the DMT story a hundred times.  Fantastic tales of being rocketed and thrust about in a roiling frenzy of zen nothingness.  The experience of void, death, life and for a crucial moment that lasts but a second and yet forever at once not knowing or caring what the difference is between either.  <BR>
<BR>
But what is really going on here?<BR>
<BR>
Is it truly perceiving the entirety of the universe at once;  are we really dead during that time?  Why is it that these are the likenesses we commonly draw from to describe the trip?<BR>
<BR>
It seems almost paradoxical that among descriptions of the 5-MeO-DMT experience you will indeed find descriptions such as 'perception of the entire universe' along side 'perception of void and nothingness'.  Everything and nothing at once forever but only for an instant.  The experience challenges you to strech your imagination to its limit and one conjures up these extremities of thought in a seething explosion of cerebral activity.  And it's not as though we are conscioius of such thoughts, only of the bleary fluid mush that has become our existence.  <BR>
<BR>
At the peak of the experience one seems to indeed enter a state of zen.  The senses and mind become transfixed and the mind is emptied of content; one enters a state of near perfect focus, but focus on nothing.  DMT seems to forcibly strip away anything familiar, or at least distort it beyond any recognizable form.  At the peak of my strong experiences, right after exhaling the hit, the visuals become so intense that my visual field truly swirls away to blackness.  Or at least blankness, for the distinction between black and white is as useless as the distinction between anything so diametrically opposite in the DMT world.  <BR>
<BR>
And so perhaps this is why we liken this to our preconception of what it very well might be like to experience the dead state.  With DMT standing in for our neurotransmitters, it effectively stimulates our brain indiscriminantly and with no order whatsoever.  Thus it is that thoughts, or at least concepts, from all branches of the human experience are triggered at once and with such ferocity as to flood our senses with everything and anything we know or sense or have sensed and remembered as well as makes us feel everything we can feel at once...angry, sad, happy, others...all at once and incredibly intense so as to make them indistinguishable from each other as all the colours together make white, which is nothing like its constituents...though seemingly more pure in some sense.  <BR>
<BR>
And thus what is so much mental noise any more than everything seeming as nothing, the way a crowd of many intelligent discussions sounds like a rumbling murmer of gibberish with only the odd word popping out every now and then.  Fragments of recognizable speech that are so discontinous and mutually irrelevant that it may as well be that it contains no real message at all.<BR>
<BR>
And therefore to the topic of death.  I postulate that the 5-MeO-DMT trip is not death so much as life throttled to the limit.  In such a state one is incapable of any sort of thought for all the noise, nor is one capable of interpreting the senses for all they have been warped and twisted.  What more is death than the end of body and mind?  When all comes to a halt, we are at death.  As white is to black...one and the same.<BR>
<BR>
This is only at the peak of the experience, mind you.  Soon after one is still firmly in the grips of the trip, but capable of amazement and thought.  There is preliminary reflection of the brief stay with eternity one has just exited, elevated mood and the very psychedelic leftovers of the trip as reality slowly starts to assemble itself and the engines start to lug back down to their usual idle.  The bulk of the trip is spent here, though the impact lies in the nothing.<BR>
<BR>
To those of you who have been there, this may provide some food for thought.  For those of you who havent, I assure you that no trip report can truly describe the experience.  The english language is such a clumsy tool and it so much requires a common frame of reference to be properly understood.  For this I apologize as I have here contributed, as many others, but a tiny fragment of the trip that only begins to scratch the surface of what this substance has in hold.  We do what we can :-)<BR>
<BR>
Safe tripping all, I hope this finds you all well.<BR>
