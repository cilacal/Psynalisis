This is one of the finest RC drugs to of come out of the whole market, I agree most of them suck, besides &#946;k-2C-B, 1P-LSD and a few benzos. But this is the nicest NMDA antagonist I have ever had, the experience is amazing if a little weird. The come up like &#946;k-2C-B and 1P-LSD it's very very smooth like silk. There is no nausea or weird body sensations of any kind, there is no vasoconstriction though my lips were a little numb at one point, but the rest of me was fine.<br/>
<br/>
Its pretty much non-toxic when taken orally, I only say this as I made a stupid mistake of taking too many benzos with it and found myself redosing, I blame the benzos, but I did use them as they have been said to be neuroprotective against the possibly fictional Olney's Lesions. I initial dosed with 60mg, but wanted more, I already had 2g dissolved in a solution where I transferred it into another container and that's where I drank the lot without realising it.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='erowid-warning'>[Erowid Note: 
The doses described in this report are potentially life threatening. The amount taken is beyond a heavy dose and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Doses such as this have been known to cause hospitalizations and/or deaths. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]</span><br/>
<br/>
I know that was stupid, lucky it has a high therapeutic index.<br/>
<br/>
Anyway as for the effects, it feels likes a nice euphoric high, really nice. Without the benzos, everything is clear-headed and there is no confusion, its all very floaty, with no hypnotic effects, nfact its more fo a stim.<br/>
<br/>
There is opened eyes visuals if you sit there and stare at things and zone out. I was just lying on my bed staring at a some socks on the floor. But what I saw was a farm and people going about their day as if it was from an aerial view. It wasnt a cartoon or anything it was looking like real life.<br/>
<br/>
Closed eyes visuals is a strange one, imagine your in your bedroom watching TV, you then close your eyes and your're instantly in a classroom talking to the teacher about something, your're still aware that your in your room, and you know the TV is on.<br/>
<br/>
BUT you are instantly dreaming or remote projecting somewhere else as if you just took over someone else's body from an alternate dimension. I did go higher and I can only explain it as much as returning to the source and it made me feel like nothing really matters in the end, possessions and things don't exist and mean nothing as they are an illusion and all that does matter is how you treat others. I entered the source, it was like an awakening dream or a different plane of reality, indescribable really. It was like I was lucid dreaming but awake and able to go about my day.<br/>
 <br/>
I like this drug a lot, is fun and interesting, sadly to say it shall never be seen on this earth ever again, with the UK ban on drugs. I believe its all the stimulants which are causing problems to people and the cannabinoids.<br/>
 <br/>
So I'm trying to stock up by lending money and getting as much as I can, I think 30g shold last a few years maybe, though I have gone through 5g in a week, there is tolerance too and the trip lasts from hours to maybe 12+ with after effects lasting the next day.<br/>
<br/>
One thing I noticed was the lack of interest in smoking, I usually like to smoke when on psychedelics but on this it was completely gone. Maybe if proper safety research was done t could be sold as a supplement in small none psychoactive dosage.<br/>
 <br/>
The RC market has excited me, there is so many new compounds that I haven't tried yet and probably won't ever been made.<br/>
<br/>
I know some are safe and would be far superior in effects and safety than many drugs we have to day, but at the same time many drugs, mostly the stims are dangerous and too addictive. Its such a shame we can't continue along this past of finding novel compounds that can intrigue and help us understand our minds and the world around us.<br/>
 <br/>
Once its gone its gone and that makes me sad, this drug is amazing and I sugest you all at least try to get some and try it once.<br/>
 <br/>
So far its legal as of May 2015, this wont last for long.<!-- End Body -->
