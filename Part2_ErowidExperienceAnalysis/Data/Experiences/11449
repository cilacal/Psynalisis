It all started pretty normally, an average christmas at my uncle's house, family around getting pretty drunk, including me. I probably drank 4 or 5 beers and 5 or 6 glasses of red and white wine over dinner. During this time I asked my uncle if he was coming for a cigarette he said that he would wait until after dinner and probably smoke a fat spliff instead. <br/>
<br/>
So I waited for him to skin up, in the end I had to do it myself in his bathroom. I rolled 2 pretty average sized joints and we went out to smoke them. After I had had a few tokes my head felt ready to explode, but I stupidly ignored this and continued to chuff away at the next joint. <br/>
<br/>
When we returned into the house I felt pretty stoned but nothing out of the ordinary, however after about 10 minutes I felt really fucked up and at this point pretty much lost all contact with reality and decided to go to sleep in the sitting room. While sitting there I began to feel really nauseated so I decided to go puke up in the toilet, I proceeded to puke violently for 10 minutes. I looked around the room and I realized that I was in a seriously bad state, I had fat red eye, I was shaking and my heart was going at 130 bpm. Worst of all I knew that I had to travel across London in about 40 minutes, so I went downstairs an sat under a cover for half an hour, during this time I felt like I was physically disintegrating and my brain seemed to be smashing around my head. After this time I suddenly felt fine and started to have detailed and articulate conversations with all of my family, which is almost unheard of when I'm stoned. This whole experience really shocked me.<br/>
<br/>
I am a regular user of many drugs and have done some very dangerous combos before, e.g.Valium, alcohol and cannabis, all in high doses, and have never really been sick before, then to get really fucked up off just one joint really scares me, it makes me see how incredibly powerful cannabis can be. So everyone out there be careful when smoking dope, you really never know what could happen.<!-- End Body -->
