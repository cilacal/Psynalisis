Well, just yesterday I had the goal of writing my 6-page research paper for my English class. But I knew I couldn’t do this cuz I’m usually tired and just wanna sleep. Soooo.... I thought of the brilliant idea of using the aid of caffeine pills to keep my mind focused on the task at hand. <br>
<br>
I went to my local pharmacy (CVS) and was searching where I could find some caffeine pills. After a while of searching I found the sleeping pills section and conveniently the caffeine pills were right there as well. I wondered which brand I should choose, I mean I could get 80 pills or I could settle for 40. I wasn’t even considering by the packages that had less. I finally settled with the pack of 40 vivarins cuz they were only $2 less then the pack of 80 CVS brand pills so I figured that they must have been good or something.<br>
<br>
Alright, at that time the fun was on its way... I waited until I had privacy up in my room and I cut one pill in half and scraped all of the yellow outer part off the pill. I crushed the pill into powder and decided to suck up some lines. I gradually snorted almost the entire pill while I simply swallowed another pill. I waited for a lil and I figured that my concentration was better so I got started on putting together my paper. I started to feel somewhat stimulated so I had the sudden desire to masturbate so I knocked one or two out and got back to work. <br>
<br>
Anyways...when I started typing up this thing I downed another yellow pill and put on some music. I had some good energy by now and reciting the songs on the radio and I was spitting words as smooth as a piece of glass. I really was enjoyin myself by now. I was lovin the energy the pills gave me. Well I continued writin the paper and by now I almost had 2 pages which was real progress for me. Whenever I felt as though I needed more energy to help me finish the job I took another pill.<br>
<br>
By now I think I swallowed 2 pills and snorted the most of two other pills and just swallowed whatever was left of each pill. Also, throughout the entire time I must have crapped like 3 times. I also checked my pulse every minute to see if it got any faster, umm I guess it did speed up a lil bit. After I finished three pages I took a break and used the internet and just listened to music or whatever. Oh yeah, by the way, I had a can of diet coke with lime. I eventually had my 5th and final pill and after about 2 hours after I took it is when the damage occured... <br>
<br>
I felt so horrible. Something like a really bad hangover where u feel really nauseous and wanna throwup. it was weird cuz I felt nauseous but when I tried to throw up only a lil came out, I guess I didn’t eat enough. Awww man this was the worst feelin ever. How could caffeine do this???? I was tellin myself that I would never do drugs again I just wanted this feelin to go away. I seriously thought I might die or something but I realized that my friend survived when he did a gram of coke, so I kinda knew that everything would be fine. Still I just couldn’t believe how bad I felt. The nausea was horrible. All I wanted to do was sleep but with all that caffeine in my body there was no way. It was 3 am by now and I wasn’t even considering finishing my paper, I felt so horrible...I failed to do the task and now I felt like shit.<br>
<br>
With some extreme luck I was finally able to sleep who knows when, but I woke up soon enough and was just glad it was over, even tho I felt like crap in the morning, but no where near as bad as the nite before...by the way, in the morning I weighed 114 and usually I weigh no less than 118. I guess my metabolism increased quite a bit, plus I lost some fluid weight too of course.<!-- End Body -->
