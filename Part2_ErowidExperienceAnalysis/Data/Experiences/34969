I have really never felt the need to post an experience because usually nothing I experienced compared with other experiences of the same substances.  However, this experience was very different.  The time frame's length for the experience is close to seven hours.  I had also never done it alone.<BR>
<BR>
9:15 PM Took about 25 mg. Waited an hour to start feeling the effects. Nothing.<BR>
<BR>
10:15 PM Waited 30 more minutes, give or take.<BR>
<BR>
10:45 PM Took 10 mg more.<BR>
<BR>
12:20 AM Walked outsite to smoke a cigarette.<BR>
As I smoked a cigarette, I looked down at the green hose on my porch. Suddenly it became all scaley like a garter snake. Knowing it was just the beginning of a trip I was not worried at all. The bricks on the wall looked interesting, as I zoned out looking at them I saw all sorts of things in the grooves of the bricks that I knew weren't there, i.e. random faces (no colors just brick) and undiscernable words.<BR>
<BR>
In previous 2ci experiences I have had a better, more articulate grasp on reality. By this trip, I was an experienced 2c-i user but this time, it was much less psychological and much more visual. Upon returning inside, I put in a funny movie.<BR>
<BR>
approx. 1:50 Movie had finished. I closed my eyes and was bombarded with rainbow patterns, flashing neon lights, flying around the stars, trees in outerspaces with branches that shimmered and lit up as I went by. I went in my bathroom. There is something about the paint on the wall in my bathroom which always provides visual entertainment. Staring at the wall I started to see clouds form, expanding out like a puddle of water, eventually it appeared that a skull with an afro was holding a knife and brandishing it at me. There was an unreadable title under it. When I looked down to pee, the seat of the toilet looked similar to the bricks as in there were patterns of people and the large lid looked as if someone inside it was looking down from above inside the lid, but looking up at me. It could have been a reflection, but I doubt it.<BR>
<BR>
2:30 In my room, trying to fall asleep listening to music. First I put in a CD which I was very comfortable with and had listened to many times while I was going to sleep. It was too trippy. Changed it to some regular rock music, that made me have lots of bloody and violent CEVS and OEVs such as a character in the movie I had watched with dripping fangs of blood staggering toward me holding a gun when I closed my eyes. When I opened my eyes my red and blue comforter looked soaked in blood dripping down to my floor. I decided at this point to take out my contacts. I was done for the night, I was tired of violent images, blood soaked, sharp object penetrating mayhem. <BR>
<BR>
After putting in a trippy techno cd, I managed to return to rainbow fractal chaos.<BR>
<BR>
All in all, it was a difficult experience, but it could have been worse. I managed to fall asleep at 7:30 in the morning. I had come down at about 4:30 but I still could not fall asleep.<BR>
<BR>
In conclusion, I will continue to experiment with 2ci, but with people and a lesser dose.<!-- End Body -->
