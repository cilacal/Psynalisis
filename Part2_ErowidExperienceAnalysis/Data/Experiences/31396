ok it starts out a bumbpy ride i spent mad money to get a gram of this beautiful chemical only to be jipped by the united states postal service. the tracking order said that the package had arrived but it didnt. first the company said they didnt wanna send me a replacement. after i got all the papers from the post office to file a complaint of known delivery they decided to send me a replacement. the next day it was in my hand.<br>
<br>
got together with some friends. the three ryans all of which were trippin. one on 2ci and the other too on dxm. the trip started out nice we were all just chillen havin a good time in justens basement. then my friend pat showed up with my other friend alex. me and 2ci ryan got in the car with pat and alex. then we drove around and parked to toke. well after i toked everything just went crazy the world toook on a different shape and look and i was tripping hard. it reminded me of amt in that when u look at lights the look all disstorted and pretty. but amt they moved more. also if i closed my eyes i was moving through a tunnel. at least when we were driving.<br>
<br>
the the other ryan called and we picked the two dxm ryans and drunk justin.we drove around for a little bit. the energy in the car was very weird. my vibe kept changing it went from wanting to chill to wanting to go home. i dont know wut was causing this but i have a feeling it was 'demons' in my head. after a while of tripping we all went home.<br>
<br>
now when i got home i thought it was gunna go into a positive mode. but no it didnt. it wasnt a bad trip it just fellt bad. i was having very negative and stupid thoughts. i kept reliving every akward negative vibe moment i had. in fact by the end of the night i felt like my friendships were gone. but this must be a delusion in my head or something that has been slowly happening to me. i also realized sadly that i dont know my mom and that i dont talk to her enough like i use too. this is a big deal to me because she lives so far away and we never get to see eachother. and lately ive been not going there becasue my life is soo busy. but anyway i decided i want to talk to her more and that i should try being nicer to my family. ive got shit to work out and the retro spect 2ci gave me was one step in that direction. in a week or maybe less il try it again and i prey to the gods that my vibe can stay pure and positive.<br>
<br>
i give it 5 stars..its nice clean and decpite what others say is a spritual chemical. i could feel more energy on this drug then i could handle.<br>
<br>
o and ryan if u see this...good times<!-- End Body -->
