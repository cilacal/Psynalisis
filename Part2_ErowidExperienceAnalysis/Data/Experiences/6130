It was 10:15pm. I was sitting in the basement of my friend's (J) house. I have used 2C-T-7 several times before this. I pulled out the little baggie containing 20mg of 2C-T-7 and was going to split it with J. We cut it into 2 lines and snorted it.  The first 20 minutes were extremely PAINFUL as always with 2C-T-7 My eyes began watering and my nose felt like it had been dowsed with gasoline and set on fire.... I looked up at the poster on the wall. It began to move. The edges of the poster began curling inwards and gently swaying from side to side. The visuals off 2C-T-7 are absolutely incredible. We decided to step out of the basement onto his back porch. As soon as I stepped outside, I felt a very different vibe. The energy released from the earth and plants around all seemed to be flowing and I could feel it all around me. I glanced up at the sky and the stars were all moving....It seemed as if they were giant strobe lights in the sky, searching for something (or someone) down on earth.  I have no idea as to how much time I spent staring at the stars. Next, I recall, I was talking to J and we somehow got totally confused as to what the conversation actually started out as. J began laughing and had an uncontrollable fit of laughter. I was still seeing very prominent hallucinations and looked down at my watch. It was 1:00AM. We smoked some high quality pot and J told me that he was having the greatest hallucinations that he had ever seen!<BR>
<BR>
We ended up going to bed after watching the sunrise at 8:00AM.<BR>
This was one of my most enjoyable 2C-T-7 experiences as I felt as if I was one with nature and all the materialistic things in this world totally disappeared.<!-- End Body -->
