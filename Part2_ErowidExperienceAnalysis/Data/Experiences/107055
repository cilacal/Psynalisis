<!-- Start Body -->
I had woken up at 6am after a night of drinking and I had taken a small amount of MDMA as well. I had around 10mg of moxy to my guess but it could of been much more as I had no scales and the dealer had said it was 50% stronger than the last batch. I was excited to try this as many of my friends who have little to no psychedelic experiences had told me it was amazing and the best drug they had ever had. I have taken acid twice, 2C-B twice and done quite a few trips on shrooms with the highest dose being 7 grams. I have thoroughly enjoyed all of my trips and always leave them learning new things and having slight mystical experiences. It was 6:40am when I swallowed the bitter tasting jelly.<br/>
<br/>
+15 minutes- I start feeling pretty nauseous and get a very uncomfortable body load (I have pectus excavatum so my chest capacity is pretty restricted which didn't help with the extremely increased heartrate)<br/>
<br/>
+20 minutes- Holy shit I am tripping fucking balls.The patterns I see on my wall are identical to my last shroom trip. Everything is morphing and breathing, just the usual visuals but they are pretty intense. I start to get very hot and I start feeling very uncomfortable and jittery but this is only physically. I decide to go for a cold shower and it felt amazing but I still have this horrible body load which now starts to freak me out. I get out of the shower and lie in bed for around 10 minutes and put on some music which sounds good but pretty distorted and trippy. <br/>
<br/>
+40 minutes- I now wish I hadn't done this as the physical discomfort is now really affecting me mentally and I keep thinking about waking up my mum to get some benzos and carbamazepines just to shut the trip down and sleep it off. I decide against this and go to my kitchen and I pour a glass of gin and drink this. I find myself looking out the window and feeling good and then I come up with a great plan-Go for a walk! (whenever I have felt uncomfortable on trips I find that nature totally cures me <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">whenever I have felt uncomfortable on trips I find that nature totally cures me</div></div>). After I stroke my cats for a few minutes while I am still tripping hard but I am much more chilled out after the gin I go to my room and get dressed.<br/>
<br/>
+1 hour- I head out for my walk and I have already planned my route. I find that walking feels amazing and I look at the clouds and it felt as if I was as tall at them and that I could see in front of them and behind them if that makes any sense. I get to the woods I was heading to which has a river that leads to the beach. Halfway through the woods I stop and close my eyes and I feel a total feeling of oneness and it is extremely pleasurable. One thing I notice that I keep saying to myself in my head or so it seems is 'you need to be careful what you are saying/thinking in these realms' (which I'm sure has happened on previous trips) and another thought which was 'I am glad to be welcomed to this realm and I never want to leave' (note that I am a pretty spiritual person).<br/>
<br/>
+1 hour 30- I head along to a cliffside and sit on a bench for a while and I admire the sea and my town and I start coming down slowly as the visuals decrease but I am still in a great psychedelic headspace.<br/>
<br/>
+2 hours 30- I make it home finally after going to a shop and buying cigarettes (which was very hard to do), my mum comes into my room to say that she is leaving and I am still tripping as her face is morphing.<br/>
<br/>
After this I come down gradually but pretty quickly. My experience has been pretty good but I won't be using this again as it was pretty straining physically as my chest I still sore as my heart has been beating very hard and fast. <br/>
<br/>
It is now 3pm and I can still see the pattern on my wall if I concentrate a certain way which was pretty cool.(I have also been able to do this with the pattern I seen on acid even several months later). I thought my trip would of also lasted longer but it could be due to the fact that I drank the gin and also the past few months I have been abusing MDMA and cocaine and I am still battling this.<!-- End Body -->
