<br>
Ten minutes or so after popping a gelcap full of this smelly substance, I began to feel a queasy tightening in my stomach. I thought it was odd, because I'd assumed the gelcap would take at least ten minutes to dissolve, and from what I’d heard about AMT, I thought it built up over the first hour or two, not at all prepared for the waves of electricity coming up my spine. I was stunned by how quickly it fucked me up. And unfortunately, the overriding sensation was 'Oh fuck, I just poisoned myself.' I had taken the pill on an empty stomach.
<br>

<br>
I stumbled to the bathroom down the hall to puke. The liquid in my stomach was a violent yellow color, looked like some queer chemical reaction with my gastric juices, thick and viscuous. I hung my head over the toilet and retched several times. Just a godawful almost sinister taste. My roommate was in the bathroom and when he heard me trying to purge my guts, he asked if I was okay. I sputtered through bleary eyes and mucuous that I felt like shit. 'You look like shit, stay away from me.' I went into this experience with a cold, and he was deathly afraid that I might give it to him. He says he's never been sick in his life. Odd. At least he scurried off somewhere else, because I was freaking out at the idea of having to pretend I wasn't under the influence of some really bizarre psychedelic.
<br>

<br>
Extreme discomfort, I remember thinking about the Neal Cassady comment, and deciding that this was indeed NOT a fucking rolls royce, no more like a bulldozer, man. Euuughh. I sat in the stall for awhile. The toilet paper dispenser became visually interesting. The sides were melting, the visuals were different from LSD, everything looked more solid and oozy.
<br>

<br>
I left the bathroom and managed to find the lounge in this state, still feeling quite nauseous, generally ill. Two girls were watching Ace Ventura Pet Detective at three in the afternoon, so I decided to join them. The movie's horrible script made me feel even more ill, but I decided to watch it anyway. When it was over, I made way back to my room, drenched in sweat. I thought perhaps I was allergic to this compound and maybe I was going into shock. I collapsed onto the bed, incapacitated but how fucked I felt. I tried calling a few friends, just to have someone to talk to, someone I trusted. Nobody was home so I just lay there, examining the many textures of a bauhaus poster, watching my roommate's guitar stand stretch and bend, waiting for the physical side effects to diminish so I might be able to appreciate these other aspects.
<br>

<br>
Over the course of the next two to three hours, which were ridiculously long, I just let my eyes absorb the room. I was definitely having LSD-like visuals, strong after-images, dense trails, an odd, shiny phosphorescence was coming off the walls. I eventually gathered enough courage to get up and turn on some music. modest mouse helped me feel slightly better.
<br>

<br>
As physical symptoms resolved themselves, I ventured to get up and move about and start talking to people. I called a friend in NY and proceeded to listen to him bitch about all sorts of things. I remember being pretty surprised at how normal my thought patterns were. I felt altogether lucid four hours after taking the drug. We talked for awhile and he gave no indication that I sounded like I've sounded before when I was frying or on mushrooms. There was no mind melt as with acid. I actually think that's the best part of doing LSD is the alternating feelings of utter profundity and absurdity. AMT is not really a bulldozer in that aspect then. 
<br>

<br>
I think I was just too physically sick to note the better aspects of this trip. I will give it another chance someday, lower dose most likely. I just don't see how you can beat good ol LSD.<!-- End Body -->
