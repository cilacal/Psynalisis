I got some Salvia 5X in the mail today from a friend.  Obviously, I was anxious to try this stuff.  I'd done my reading up on this substance all over the web, but nothing could prepare me for what I would eventually experience.<BR>
<BR>
T+ 0:00  Smoked:  3/8g 5X Salvia extract.<BR>
<BR>
At first, me and 2 friends carefully divided up my Salvia bag into 3/16g doses.  After smoking mine from a bong w/screen, I was un-impressed at the results.  After 2 or so minutes (enough time for each of my friends to smoke a bowl full), I re-loaded the bowl with approx. 3/16 more grams of 5X.  <BR>
<BR>
...the room I was in was a place I was comfortable with.  I've done 'shrooms there, smoked a whole lot of pot, and drank and drank and drank, so I felt OK smoking my salvia there.<BR>
<BR>
After my second bong hit, I immediately felt something very different.  I could tell something was going on.  The little elves in the forest to my right were not communicating, but it was ok, because the man/thing to my left was about to smoke too, and I knew that would be a good thing.  The forest was the home of the little ones... yet to be named... and they were the reason for this thing to exist.<BR>
<BR>
[That's the best I can explain of the 3-4 minutes that passed after my second hit]<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
T+4:00 - 7 or 8 beers later<BR>
<BR>
After a long night of drinking, we retire back to my friend's room to smoke more of the Salvia.  I pack the bowl of his bong full of the 5 for him, fully ready to re-pack it for myself once he was done.  He puts the bong to his lips, inhales, and immediately coughs out all the smoke.  Not wanting to be one to waste any substance, I immediately pick up the bong and smoked all that is left of his bowl (if I had to guess, maybe 1/4g of the 5X extract).  <BR>
<BR>
WOW<BR>
<BR>
What I experienced next is possibly the most incredibly psychotropic experience of my life.<BR>
<BR>
Colors... whirling... spinning... flying....  <BR>
<BR>
After about a minute I'm aware of the fact that there are 2... [What’s?] People sitting there....  they know something [English??] that I can't figure out...<BR>
<BR>
Something about them being the all-knowing, all experiencing beings of the universe....<BR>
<BR>
After a few minutes of swirling, pulsating madness, I realize these to be my friends, but still can't figure out any way to communicate with them<BR>
<BR>
After a few tries at 'Bleh the thing wertng ghann...'  and ' you're then tharrs... blehn therrrg....', I finally re-mastered the English language... but nothing I could think of was letting me express to them what had just happened.<BR>
<BR>
The only way I can describe this is:  POWERFUL. I was going into this experience expecting very little, but came out a changed person. The absolute power behind this drug is something unparalleled in my years of experience.<!-- End Body -->
