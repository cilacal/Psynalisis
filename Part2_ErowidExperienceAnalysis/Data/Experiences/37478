I had been a fairly regular drinker up until my experience with alcohol poisoning. I drank every weekend, and sometimes drank till I puked, but i had never really gone overboard with alcohol. I, like most kids my age, didn't really realize how dangerous alcohol can be in high doses, and had never really considered that too much alcohol can kill you. Woops! Ignorance didn't help me in the end.<br>
   <br>
The experience began fairly regularly, me and my friend, H, were bored one saturday afternoon, so we decided to take 6 shots each of Vodka. I have a pretty low tolerance, so that is about as much as i could have drinken before getting queasy. Me and H were having a great time and decided to head down to the beach.  <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span>  We drove down to the beach (i would never recommend drinking and driving, you know it kills) and we lounged around for a few hours, just talking and laughing, usual drunkeness. Soon it was hours later, the sun had already set, and my buzz was begining to wear off. H then called up some of her other friends and invited them down to come join us. They arrived around 7pm with a cooler full of various bottles of hards, beers and wines. They all sat with H and began talking with her, but it was awkward for me since I didn't know any of them very well, so i just sat by myself, lonely, swigging a bottle of tequila. Well, swigging is probably the wrong word, i some how ended up chugging most of the 1 liter bottle. <br>
<br>
I calculate that I took around 18 shots worth of tequila within 5 minutes. I had no idea how much i had drinken, all i knew was that i wasn't feeling the buzz of the tequila yet and it was 15 minutes later. So I chugged three beers. This gave me a grand total of around 21 drinks in my system, all drinken within a 20 minute timespan, with a further 6 drinks that i had drinken approximately 3 hours before. A few minutes after the few beers i started to feel really, REALLY drunk. All the tequila, which had so sneakily lied in wait, was beggining to hit me. I stumbled over to a friend, C, and told her i was starting to feel sick...<br>
<br>
cut to the next morning. I wake up, on a roll-a-way bed in my house, with my mom on a roll-a-way next to me. The time jump between me at the beach to me in my house was like the blink of an eye. I looked over at a clock and the time was 5:30 am. I looked down at my shirt and noticed that it was covered in puke and blood. I started to panic, 'What the fuck happened?!''Did I drive home?!''Why am I here?!' I have never blacked out until this, and i could not remember a single detail of the night after the aforementioned. I was suddenly taken over by an urge to vomit. I walked out of my house, not totally convinced my mom knew what i did, and started puking. My mouth was bloody, i am guessing from coming in too much contact with my stomach acid. My mom then came up beside me and said, 'that was the worst night of my life.' <br>
<br>
It took accounts from my friends who were there and my parents to piece together what happened. After my memory cut off, with me telling my friend C i was feeling sick, i walked over to a lawn chair by myself. My friends went over a little later to find me passed out, puking all over myself. They picked me up and took me up to my car, which was a pretty good distance away. They said the whole time I was just mumbling 'please no, it hurts so bad.' They loaded me in their car while my friend took my car. They were to afraid to tell me parents what had happened when they got to my house, so they just put me on a roll-a-way bed and left me (bastards). Luckily my mom awoke (mothers instinct i guess) and found me. She stayed with me the whole night. She said i was unconcious, shivering, drenched in a cold sweat, and vomiting in my sleep. I could have easily died had i not been under supervised care the whole night.<br>
<br>
Cut back to the morning after. That morning i was running to the bathroom to puke every 10 minutes, which decreased in intervals until later on that night when I stopped puking. I lost 8lbs, i felt weak and sick for days after, and was scared out of drinking for a long time after. I began drinking again a few months later, and continue to, but i have not gotten sick once from alcohol since then. It took me a night of hell to learn how to drink, lets hope it isn't the same for you.<!-- End Body -->
