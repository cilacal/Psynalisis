I became interested in Clonazolam because I had experienced a few months of poor sleep which hadn't responded to OTC medication and improved 'sleep hygiene'. To this end, I took 0.25mg before bed, and found that it did increase the time I was able to remain asleep, from an average of 3 hours to 6. So in that regard, I feel the drug was highly successful. I experienced no side effects, and didn't feel the need to take it on days that I didn't work. It is important to note that I work nights, but hadn't had problems sleeping through the day until recently.<br/>
<br/>
I got the idea to try a bit more to attempt to experience the more recreational aspects of this drug, so I doubled the dose. I had anticipated that I would simply fall asleep more quickly, or stay asleep longer. What actually happened was I got very hungry, prepared a meal - after this, I have no recollection of events. None. I woke up in bed about 8 hours later, and assumed I had slept.<br/>
<br/>
What had actually happened was I had taken the dose at midnight, ate at approximately 1AM, wandered around the kitchen, drank something which upon later inspection seemed to be cooking oil and diet cola (?!), factory reset my Vita (not why I was expecting to utilize cloud save data backup, but here we are), and then woke my boyfriend up at 3AM when I KNEW he had work at 6AM... to ask for a backrub. He had me lie down instead, which is how I came to wake up in bed.<br/>
<br/>
I understand through further reading that these incidents of amnesia are far less common among those with experience with drugs within the benzodiazepine family, as it were. Unfortunately, I have none, and I think it really shows. I still use this drug at 0.25mg and it has continued to function as intended, however I would strongly advise caution to anyone in regard to the amount you chose to use unless you feel comfortable blacking out - I know I don't, regardless of the circumstances.<!-- End Body -->
