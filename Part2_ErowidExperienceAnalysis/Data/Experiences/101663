At around 9pm I took 10mg. I was with my brother and three of his friends, who were all only smoking weed that night but I'd wanted to try this for awhile so I bought a capsule off one of them and figured I'd see what the fuss was about. I was feeling a little buzzed after about an hour, and it was quite pleasant. My earlobes felt like they were melting when I tugged on them.<br/>
<br/>
It was 10:45 when I felt it hit properly, and it felt similar to MDMA mentally for me - a strong buzz around my head, and instant euphoria. My muscles kind of seized up though, which I didn't think anything about at the time. I spent the next half hour just hanging out and having a good time.<br/>
<br/>
The guy that sold me the first cap gave me another one, which I wasn't going to refuse, having fun as I was. I took a second 10mg dose at 11:30.<br/>
<br/>
We listened to music, and I started having trouble remembering where in the song it was, kind of zoning out. I didn't enjoy the music as much as I had hoped I would (my experiences with MDMA are much more intense in this aspect) but it wasn't unpleasant.<br/>
<br/>
My brother was having a grand time trying to lead my line of thinking - saying things such as 'why do you have arms?' and 'it's someone's job to print the t-shirts you buy'. I repeatedly asked him to stop because I trust myself to think and do what I'm comfortable with when I'm intoxicated and his leading was setting me on edge because I didn't particularly want to have existential thoughts, I just wanted to have a good time. The disassociation started setting in fiercely and I was trying to keep myself more grounded in reality than it seemed my brother wanted me to be.<br/>
<br/>
I started to hallucinate at 12:15. First it looked like the curtains were waving with a slight breeze, then soon everything looked like funhouse mirror reflections if I didn't take the time to specifically focus on them. I needed to go outside for some air for a few seconds because while it was interesting, I wasn't handling it well.<br/>
<br/>
I spent a lot of time lying on the floor as my muscles tensed up in random bursts - shoulders, legs, stomach, back, all just seizing up periodically as I lay there. It wasn't unpleasant, but it was odd. My jaw locked up pretty substantially, and I had a strip of leather I use for when I grind my teeth which I used to keep myself from breaking them. I personally kind of like it when my teeth grind though so this wasn't a big deal.<br/>
<br/>
At 1:30 I figured I should go to bed ‘cause they were all passing out and I wanted to try to sleep because I had work the next morning.<br/>
<br/>
Time slowed down a lot - I would put my phone down and lay in bed and then probably 5 minutes later it would feel like I’d been there for hours. Which I guess is possibly a cool thing if I wasn’t starting to have a bad time by then.<br/>
<br/>
I was hallucinating still when I turned the lights out - it looked like lights were still on even though it was pitch black in my bedroom, and I couldn’t remember when I switched positions so suddenly I’d be in a place I didn’t remember getting to even though I was mostly awake.<br/>
<br/>
I spent the whole night wishing someone was there to hold on to ‘cause I really need physical grounding when I’m high and MDMA (which was my reference point as it was the only other thing I'd done at that point) enhances what’s real while this did not do that. So I spent the entire night both paranoid I’d get no sleep for work/still be high for it and unable to tell what was real and what wasn’t. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">So I spent the entire night both paranoid I’d get no sleep for work/still be high for it and unable to tell what was real and what wasn’t.</div></div><br/>
<br/>
My brain decided also to try to come up with scenarios that I would feel comfortable in and could act out in my head to like placebo-ground me but those weren’t real so that caused me to be even more disassociated and I couldn’t concentrate on them long enough for it to have worked anyway.<br/>
<br/>
I slipped in and out of consciousness for the rest of the night, tossing and turning with much of the same disassociation throughout. My alarm went off at 8 and I got out of bed.<br/>
<br/>
I felt distant and nauseous, and was uncharacteristically quiet. I was having trouble not going into a panic attack, but I got to work without any trouble.<br/>
<br/>
I luckily was able to have short naps while I was at work (mostly by the toilet, as I felt like I was going to vomit). I also had mild diarrhea.<br/>
<br/>
My shift ended at 1 and I went home, then had a nap until 4. I felt normal when I woke up, if a bit mentally foggy but that is most likely just from the nap.<!-- End Body -->
