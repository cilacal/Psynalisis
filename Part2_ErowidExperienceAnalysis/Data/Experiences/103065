I snorted 1000 ug of 25i, maybe less than that. But judging by previous mescaline, LSD, psilocin and a vast array of other chemicals to gauge the intensity of this experience with. (I do large dosages to try and get the most out of the experience instead of chronic mediocre dosages) it must have been AT LEAST 800 ug+ .<br/>
<br/>
It was being sold as LSD, the dealer himself a dumbfuck and believing it was, but considering I did real LSD awhile back, the second the trip hit although there was a lot of similearities there was a few things that immediately threw it off<br/>
<br/>
I snort the 'acid' with 3 other people all doing '1 drop' each and the dealer immediately leaves. It takes about 180 seconds for me to start noticing effects, I am greatly surprised that it wasn't bunk and was at first happy as hell. But my friend who was compulsively trying to 'FRY ON ACID' the whole day quickly says 'CAN THIS STOP NOW' at first I thought he was a pussy... I told him to pack his fuckin seatbelts and thats when shit got cray<br/>
<br/>
We quickly got so high to the point we couldn't move or talk, the visuals were I hate to admit the best I ever had and I hate to give 25i props for that, for once I experienced synethesia where I could hear the visuals, see sound, and my sense of smell became touch. Very weird and hard to understand, AND BTW this is by minute 4... Not even 240 seconds later and I am at a semi-uncomfortably intense +++ experience. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">Not even 240 seconds later and I am at a semi-uncomfortably intense +++ experience.</div></div> <br/>
<br/>
THAN SHIT GETS CRAZY<br/>
<br/>
As all my senses start to blend into one universal format, I was taken into the 'void' of how people describe 5-MeO-DMT. It was pitch black but I could see stars and weird circular machinery and Mandelbrot sets. I for once on any drug adventure experienced extreme auditory effects, it sounded like a V8 engine accelerating but with lots of echo and it would reach a point of deafening intensity and with LOTS OF ECHO would slowly taper off, the noise was very uncomfortable. At one point I existed as nothing but a sea of atoms, I forgot I was alive. I entered a 'thought loop' where minutes felt like hours...  During the 5 minute point I could have sworn we were going to die from serotonin syndrome and was panicking hard about death but during the 'time loop' death didn't bother me, I now think that we're already dead... <br/>
<br/>
Anyways, I am the first person to attempt to start walking around, I knock over a very expensive shelf containing expensive glassware and my friends were crying via bad trip, too afraid to care. I ended up leaving the house, where I black out again *as I did during timeloop* and I only remember the part where I look down and I'm naked... Dont remember why I got naked or for what... <br/>
<br/>
I dont remember cops, I dont remember hospital, I remember spending another night awake in jail... Wondering WTF DID I DO<br/>
<br/>
Since this I have quit all drugs and obtained a job, but I might go to jail for indecent exposure and trespassing. <br/>
<br/>
Please don't do 25i, I was the person that thought I could handle my drugs <br/>
<br/>
I dont remember getting naked or why, <br/>
<br/>
