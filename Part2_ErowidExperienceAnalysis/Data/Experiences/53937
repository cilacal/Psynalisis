About two weeks ago I went to a party near my house that catered to techno and pyschedelic trance fans.<br/>
<br/>
Before going myself and a friend had tried to organise some ghb but had failed and so opted to get E instead. Now, since both of us have rather high tolerances he got 4 pills and I got 5.<br/>
<br/>
Upon arriving we double dropped, the time was around 10pm, we then double dropped again 40 minutes later. About an hour after that I ran into an aquaintance who I hadn't seen in a while who mentioned he had 'psychedelic mdma'. I bought two 100mg caps of him and gave one to my friend. We dropped these around 12:30.<br/>
<br/>
Later on he told me the mdma was mixed with 2CB.<br/>
<br/>
After about an hour I was really starting to feel the mdma at which point I saw the person I'd bought it from go into the bathrooms. I followed him to say thanks and to tell him how good it was. However I ended up waiting for about 30 minutes outside the bathrooms at which point his girlfriend came running out, so I wandered in and found him unconcious next to a toilet. Myself, another friend and the bouncer carried him outside where we learnt from his gf that he'd down half a 40ml vial of nearly pure ghb and he'd been drinking. Much chaos ensued but eventually we got someone to take him to hospital.<br/>
<br/>
At this point it had been quite a while since I'd taken the mdma and was starting to wonder what exactly was so psychedelic about it. As soon as I walked back in the club I knew. My vision became a soup of neon colours, people's clothing was changing colour more rapidly than I could follow and the entire world was made up of tiny red and green pixles.<br/>
<br/>
I found my friend who'd also taken the mdma and asked if he was tripping to which he replied no. I told him he would be shortly and then proceded to tell anyone who'd listen about how confused I was but also how amazing it was. At one point I tried to go and dance but that was impossible as I could barely see, let alone dance.<br/>
<br/>
Not long after that my friends decided it was time to leave so myself and my friend piled ourselves into another sober friends car and I then tried to direct her back to my house. Things were complicated by the fact that I couldn't see out of her windscreen as it was full of swirling motes of colour and strange fractal patterns.<br/>
<br/>
Thankfully we got home safely, where she went to bed and myself and my mate sat outside tripping and talking nonsense for several hours.<br/>
<br/>
All in all it was utterly amazing, except for the ghb drama, and I wish we hadn't left the party as early as we did.<br/>
<br/>
The combination of the mdma and 2cb was like an ultra friendly candy flip and whilst I tripped harder than I ever have before it was always fun if a little confusing but never overwhelming. There was none of the tension and 'sense of impending doom' that I associate with lsd.<!-- End Body -->
