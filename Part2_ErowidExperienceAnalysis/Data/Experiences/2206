my first adventure with 2ct7; started with 20mg, another 10mg as it came on, about 1.5 hours later. taken at a party in familiar and comfortable surroundings, with a dozen or so friends, some of whom i hadn't seen in a year or so. my mindset going in was set for party and socialize with these friends, just plain Fun plus whatever the material wanted to show me.<BR>
<BR>
as it came on, i fell into an aimless, dreamy state of mind. i seemed physically capable of doing things like making chai and tending a fire, but had no concentration or will to do so. wandered about the party for 3-4 hours like this, feeling vaguely bored at times, was able to socialize with friends. it was very setting-dependent: if the music got me on my feet, i could dance; if the conversation was engaging, i could talk with people and get into that flow. walking around the party, visiting with folks or hanging out somewhere felt surreal, disconnected. yet i recognized everything and everyone around me, felt in reasonable control of my self and my reactions, etc.<BR>
<BR>
i tried various ways to think and not-think about some Things in my life both great and small...felt 'normal'. no new threads or connections or surprises or anything special. in fact, i was struck by the fact that, 3 hours into it my thought processes seemed to be operating at baseline. a sense of waiting for the next level takes over. i had tentative plans to mix this with 2cb, since it was available at the time, so 4 hours into it i take 20mg 2cb.<BR>
<BR>
the zing was unmistakeable and quick (15-20 mins). lots of social energy, dancing and other physical activity felt great. still daydreamy, had moments of slipping into vivid reveries, then 'waking up' and being very engaged with my environment. emotional shifts between desire for people and wanting to be alone or distant. weird and quick segues between these states. lots of sensating and moving around. lost track of time. some hunger, ate a little bread and jam. the recurring moments of 'waking up' as i came down became more frequent and lasted longer, but without any sensation of being sleepy as i usually experience it. at T+10 hours, i finally laid down to sleep, successfully, except that i kept waking up. able to fall asleep again after each waking with no problem. when i was awake, i felt surprisingly clear-headed.<BR>
<BR>
woke up the next morning in a bad mood, felt some ire at how the night had gone, irritated. wondered if it was a waste of time or not. it didn't seem like anything worthwhile had been accomplished or experienced the night before. i didn't feel back to 'normal' until the 3rd day after. my thought processes were different, my emotions were taking strange turns with little or no provocation. issues and problems that had been on my mind before and during the experience came to the fore and demanded to be dealt with. 5 days later i can report some headway on these sticky personal issues though no conclusions or breakthroughs per se. i was able to explicate the more complicatd emotions around the decisions to be made, which was illuminating and helpful for me and my partner.<BR>
<BR>
to summarize, if i ever repeat this combination, which is unlikely, it'll be with a smaller group of people who are very close to me.<!-- End Body -->
