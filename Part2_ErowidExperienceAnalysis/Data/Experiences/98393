I was feeling stupid on friday night. Not only was my dose irresponsible (as there have been hospitalizations from 1200mcgs of 25c alone), my mindset was improper. A few days before I was informed that my grandfather has stage 3 cancer, and a very small chance of living. I know many people that 'trip through' bad events to gain insight, but this was not the time or place. <br>
<br>
I flipped a coin and heads was the outcome, so in went two 600mcg 25c-nBOMe blotters and one 1200mcg 25i-nBOMe blotter at T+0:00. I lost track of time talking with friends online, and by the time I checked, it had been 1.5 hours since I put them in my lip. As usual, there was the uncomfortably large wad of chemical-flavored spit in my mouth, which after looking at the time and noticing how high I was, was promptly spit out into a cup. I removed the three blotter pieces from my mouth shortly thereafter, and while I was doing so my brother came downstairs and asked if I wanted a dab of oil. This oil is no nasty brown, I should mention; we only stock high-quality golden wax. It had been at least a month since my last dab of oil, though I live in a stoner's paradise, so I happily obliged, if only due to my lack of judgement. I took a relatively large dab, on recollection alone I'd say it was a point of hash oil. <br>
<br>
The titanium nail was heated, I inhaled and touched the dabber to the nail on the oil rig, and off I went. I coughed once, but from so deep in the chest and with such force that my eyes teared. I immediately got some egg nog (unusual considering my go-to drink is sweet tea and I'm lactose intolerant) and sit on the couch. I was tripping so hard I couldn't comprehend the TV or computer. It was full open-eye visuals, so intense and vividly colored that it often obscured the warped and unrecognizable images on the TV. I knew I was incapacitated, for the most part, so I just kept sitting until 2AM, when my housemate 'E' and his co-worker 'H' arrived from closing up shop. I was convinced that they knew I was tripping, considering I was wrapped up in a blanket, drinking egg nog with a shit eating grin on my face. I went out for a cigarette with E after realizing I was unable to maintain conversation with H on any more complex of a level than 'what's good, bro'. While I was having a cigarette with E, I told him about my concerns. <br>
<br>
My trip had turned sour in the last 20 or so minutes since E and H arrived, not because I didn't enjoy their company but because I realized that my resting heart rate was astronomical (I could feel my heart beating through a thick blanket, it was faster than it had ever been from physical exertion, and I work a manual labor job) and that even though I'd been wrapped up in a blanket for 2 hours, my arms and legs were freezing. My hands were orange and frosty cold. My limited train of thought led me to believe that the dangerous heart rate combined with limb coldness were the signs of a minor phenethylamine overdose (CNS overstimulation, vasoconstriction, and inability to think straight) which made me about 50% sure I was going to die.<br>
<br>
I told E this, but he didn't take me seriously and went to bed because he thought I was just stoned. I was convinced at this point not only that I would die, but that my best friend and housemate had abandoned me and was indifferent to my possible death. This was probably T+4:00 after dosing without any decrease in effects. <br>
<br>
Open Eye Visuals were bright, vivid, complicated fractals, Closed Eye Visuals were very realistic mechanisms and environments. The two I remember were 1. A large clockwork mechanism with gears and cogs, colored pink and blue, all rotating against each other in perfect timing, and 2. A large data bank, with shelves, that I was zooming through the middle of. Every time a file peeked out of a shelf, I would hear a subconscious thought. Something simple like 'Remember to clean your tea table', but so many thoughts so rapidly, within fractions of seconds of one another, that I had to open my eyes and shake it off. These closed-eye visuals were more intense than heavy smoked doses of DMT (which, after coming into 5 grams of it, I had a lot of experience with.) <br>
<br>
I stared death in the face, not a literal visualization of death, but a flash of thought every now and again that I will probably die from my irresponsibility within the night, at which thought I couldn't bring myself to care. I realized before this that an odd life has desensitized me to pain, pleasure, and fear, but not that my disregard for pain and fear have permeated into my existence so far as to make me unafraid of death. I realized that instead of having caution and fear as natural reactions to danger, I must consciously exercise caution in the face of danger so as to not maim or kill myself. I contemplated the oddity that I'd prefer to keep living, but I didn't fear death coming as soon as today, but put the idea on hold for pondering some other time. <br>
<br>
I need to repair my mind, but psychedelics may not be the way to do this. More than that, I need to exercise caution, not only in daily life, not only in work, but in recreation. In the same manner that I walk around an open manhole or avoid a random fight on the block, I need to dose in a responsible and safe manner; to stop foregoing safety in the pursuit of pleasure. Another thing I learned is that I had been chasing this level of high with 25x compounds for quite some time, but the milder, more clear-of-mind ++ high is much more preferable and more comfortable. This was a strong +++ for sure. 8 hours, out of which 6 were more intense than DMT, but on the downside the comedown was horrendously unpleasant and I felt like death the next day. <br>
<br>
I STRONGLY advise against taking doses in excess of 1200mcg (and NO, I don't mean 1200mcg of each), in my psychedelic experience the high became not only unpleasant but felt dangerous and damaging to my body. Please exercise caution where I did not, and be advised that these substances, like classic 2c's, are potentiated drastically by cannabis and have a steep dose-response curve.<!-- End Body -->
