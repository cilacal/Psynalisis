My bro and I were always after whatever we could get. The MS Contins and oxy's were getting way to expensive and we were always after real H but could never find it. My bro started a new job about 3 months ago and quickly found himself immersed in the drug culture. Sure enough, we found a guy who had the real deal. <BR>
<BR>
Last saturday we started it out nice with 20mg's valium mixed with 4mg's xanax and just drinkin beer all day. We were feeing wonderful and stupid too. We were getting bored with the benzo buzz We decided we needed the extra boost of an opiate, the real thing would be perfect we thought.<BR>
<BR>
He called The Man, the bundle was purchased, we split it 5 bags a piece and we immediately started snorting away - all the while we kept this a secret from our wives. The Man supposedly told my bro that this was some very powerful high quality stuff - and his bags were quite generous to boot. I have always been very cautious about my intake so I was snorting 1/4 a bag at a time, giving it some time then go back later for another line, etc. The Man was right about the quality - the euphoria was breathtaking and absolutely wonderful - well worth every penny - best I ever had.<BR>
<BR>
I was not paying much attention to my bro who had snorted the stuff before so I figured he knew his dosing. He was in and out of the bathroom quite a bit. We were still drinking moderately and we popped a couple more valiums and xan's. I honestly don't know how many he had but it wasn't many that I saw - just a couple.<BR>
<BR>
Well, everything was fine we had a great fuckin night. I remember him saying a few times 'there is no better buzz then this'. Around 2am we parted ways. I went home with my wife and my Bro went in and went to bed with his wife.<BR>
<BR>
Around 9am the next morning I got a call from my sister; she woke up to her peaceful looking husband cuddled up to her except the problem was he was cold and his lips were blue. He of course was dead and had been dead for quite some time. He couldn't be resessitated.<BR>
<BR>
Later we searched the house and found nothing so I figure he must have snorted all 5 bags.<BR>
<BR>
As you can imagine, the fallout from this incident has been a complete fucking train wreck like I have never seen. I'm 29, he was only 28 and my sister is destroyed in every way. Imagine waking up to the lifeless body of your soulmate right in your face. She said she originally woke up because she was feeling cold from something - it was my bro's cold lifeless body. I can not even believe this happened to me - I can not believe I am a statistic - I was always one of you guys reading these stories - never being part of one. <BR>
<BR>
My sister knew about the valiums and xanax but not the H. I had to tell her about that, that we lied, sneaking in the bathroom and doing lines. went behind her back, etc.<BR>
<BR>
Holy shit guys, please be fucking careful with this shit. You don't need a needle to OD and die from it.<BR>
<BR>
My wife raided my stash of drugs and flushed everything down the toilet and I was happy to let her do it. (I kept quiet about the small stash of MS Contins I had hidden in the basement because I'm a fucker and I still wanna get high) And you know what's sicker still, is that my sister made me swear to never do the shit again and I'm already high on a handful of MS Contins right now - I even thought about shooting these things for my farewell salute to drugs but if that went wrong - the repercussions would be Earth-shattering for my already-fucked family.. Even though I am high, I don't plan on getting any more of these and going back to the simple old beer and whiskey routine.<BR>
<BR>
Fuck. I'm not going to preach to anybody, just learn from my mistake, don't ever let somebody go to sleep on heavy doses of H - even snorted - they might not ever wake up...<!-- End Body -->
