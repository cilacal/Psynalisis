I've been working on furthering my 2c-i experience, as I feel that it has interesting and unique synergies with each combination I try.  It's 'gentle' nature and un-pushiness are very appealing to me, as I can generally go on functioning normally while under it's influence. The combos have ranged from alcohol to salvia, with many more included. This particular instance was on the day that I tried amphetamines for my second time.  I had copped a bottle of 20 or so dexedrines 2 days earlier, and had only experimented with a small (30mg) dose the night before.  I really enjoyed the focus it gave me, and not to mention the light, but pleasurable buzz.  I was talking with the ease a 6 pack of beer produces, while maintaining my sober thought process. After a long, sleepless night on the internet, (I don't usually sleep at night very much anyway) I had posted and received replies about combining 2c-i with amphetamines.  I received a green light, with the only caution being that it might be a bad idea to combine a stimulating drug with amphetamines, if one doesn't have much of a tolerance.<br>
<br>
So to building a tolerance it was then, and I downed 4 15mg of the time-released capsules and waited for the effects.  In about 30 minutes or so, I felt the speediness coming on, and I eventually eased into a very nice and measurably intense high. I was chatting away on the internet to a friend or two, and I realized it was time for class.  I absentmindedly felt the vial of 2c-i in my pocket, then took it out. After a brief mental argument, I decided 'what the hell' and poured out a healthy dose of about 20mg, perhaps a tad more, and swallowed it down before I could change my mind. Despite being a confirmed 2c-i enthusiast, I had taken about a week's break prior to this day, just to fight tolerance a bit, so I knew that would be fun by itself.<br>
<br>
I emptied my pockets of any drug paraphernalia in the improbable but possible incident that I might have a nasty reaction, and left for english class. We discussed research papers and everything was fine and dandy. Then the 2c-i started to kick in. With the amps in my body, 2c-i lost its characteristic friendliness.  Instead of the intense yet controllable sensations, it became very pushy.  The visuals were not the usual light, wispy waves and ripples, but solid, forceful distortions that my perceptions warped to match. The high was different also. I expected that the addtion of another stimulant would make my mind race, like with pot, but instead I was able to make stable, but trippy, thoughts.<br>
<br>
Then I had a sort of embarassing moment.  This english professor is the type that is always doing examples of various grammatical concepts and writing topics on the blackboard, calling on people for answers along the way.  I like to credit myself as a fairly intelligent student, and in this english class I am called on quite frequently because I will generally give a correct and somewhat insightful answer, even on the many occasions I’d be tripping. On this day, however, when she got to the example portion of class, all I could think was 'don't pick me, don't pick me'.  Naturally, she instantly did. In my head I knew what I wanted to say, but when I opened my mouth the words came out in a broken, halting fashion, kind of like on fear and loathing when Johnny Depp was checking into the hotel on lsd.<br>
<br>
Something like this had never happened to me before, I had never lost control to this degree on any substance. My voice was being manipulated by my wavering surroundings and perceptions, and to make it worse, hearing the stuttering sound I made only increased my troubles, because I’d try to think about what I had already said. After an eternity I managed to spit out something, and the professor just kind of stared for a moment, apparently in disbelief that such utter stupidity would come out of my fairly educated mouth.  She moved on quickly after that, but I was still floored by the realization that I really was so messed up I couldn't talk.<br>
<br>
I waited impatiently for the class to end, then I skipped my next one to avoid any further incidents, and headed back to my dorm.  I socialized various, people for the remainder of the night, with my ability to communicate in a somewhat normal manner returning to me after the 2c-i quit peaking. I went on to study for an exam without trouble, and had the focus to unravel an extremely entangled slinky.  I was still feeling considerable effects up to 9 hours after ingestion of the 2c-i, both substances apparently prolonging the effects of the other.  After most discernable effects subsided, I still had a very thick afterglow lasting up until I went to sleep, which I experience none of with 2c-i alone.  <br>
<br>
This was a very intense but enjoyable experience, surpassing all before including my 50mg+ escapades, but that's a different story altogether. I definitely intend on trying it again.  As a word of warning ,however, you might want to save this combo for situations that don’t require composed communication. Otherwise, enjoy, and have fun.<!-- End Body -->
