First of all I'd like to say that I have done every drug out there except Heroin. I drink heavily and smoke tons of pot. No drug can begin to compare to my many xanax experiences. A friend of mine (who is a total mess mentally and physically) gets tons of pills of all sorts. Anyway, rewind to one day a little after Christmas. I had been taking xanax regularly as they were cheap and easy to get. So I get a call from said friend that he just got 50 bars (2mg). I bought the whole bottle. After selling 10 or 15, I started popping them.<br/>
<br/>
I started out with what I call trail mix (2 10mg percocet and 3 2mg xannies) I had a pretty high tolerance for these two substances so it wasnt a big deal. I was fucked up but nothing I couldnt handle. Around 7pm another friend called to see if I was coming over to watch football that night. I drove over there with a 12 pack of Bud and watched the game. Smoking tons of pot and passing xanbars around like M&M's. I leave for home around 11 or 12 that night. As I get home a friend calls hearing I had some pills so I sell him 5. So I was sitting around drinking and at about 1 am another friend calls and wants some. He cant get a ride over. So I was all fucked up and driving didnt seem like a bad idea. (NOTE: Xanax makes you feel like you can do anything with no repercussions. I call it whiskey in a pill)<br/>
<br/>
<span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span><br/>
<br/>
So I drive the 40 minutes down to his house with no problem. Get there about 2:30 am. Hang out, drink beer, eat a few bars. Nothing to it.  At around 5 I start thinking its time to leave knowing if I crash on his couch I will be there till dinner time the next day. So I leave. After turning the wrong way out of his driveway (onto a one way HIGHWAY) I make a u turn over the grass median. I'm driving along (FUCKED UP) the road fumbling for my lighter in my pocket and drops on the floor. As I lean to get it, I swerved. Blue lights in my mirror and I know Im screwed.<br/>
<br/>
So I pull over (on the median which is the wrong side) and wait for the law to come walking up to my window. I hadnt been heavily drinking in hours but I stunk like booze. He asked me out of the car and thats when every pill Id eaten kicked in full effect. I fell out of the car onto the officers feet. In cuffs the put me in the cop car. Knowing I still had about 15 xannies in my pocket I reached around (in cuffs) pulled the bottle out of my pocket and stuffed in my boxer briefs. During the short ride to the station I was shitting bricks as this particular town is known for hard time for any drug. I also had 5 or 6 loose bars in my back pocket. So brilliant me ate them in the back of the car to lessen the count if they found them.<br/>
<br/>
Cut to inside the station. I was slurring so bad the cops barley knew what i was saying. One cop who I presume was on motorcycle duty walked in with those tall boots and leather jacket and I said something to the effect of 'Evening Hitler, how are things in the third Reich'. Then the smartest thing I did all night occurred. I refused the Breathalyzer. Why? Cause I knew my blood alcohol had diminished under the legal limit and I was clearly, without a doubt falling down drunk (thats what they thought) If I had blown low then they would have taken blood. At my expense. And know I was on xannies which is a stiffer fine and loss of D.L. for longer. So I call my mom and tell her to pick me up. It was 6 am so she was still sleeping. I heard the message a day or 2 later. I said I was arrested by CH Township cops in AC Twp. Both wrong. I didnt know where I was. The cops hearing this tried her again a few minutes later and told her where I was.<br/>
<br/>
So the cops bring me to her waiting outside the little room where I was berating every cop I saw. When they went to had me the tickets I slapped them out of the cops hand and said 'Fuck off pig, mail the tickets to me'. Then as they physically forced me down to pick them up (the tickets) the little bottle of xannies popped out of my waistband. It was like slow motion. The little bottle tumbling end over end to floor. I tried to step on it put one cop grabbed too soon. He stood up and with a smile he said 'And what are these?' Thinking on my feet I said 'those are my allergy pills I got online from Canada' He asked my mom if I had allergies and she said yes, I owe you one mom. He handed them to her and we were on our way.<br/>
<br/>
So I get home about 6:30 or 7 am and pass out. My mom comes in to check on me and she cant wake up. Next thing I know I in an ambulance. I get to the hospital and check myself out and had to panhandle train fair to get home. So there I am, in my boxers and a t shirt on the train at 8 am. Commuters staring at me cause I had no shoes, had heart monitors stuck all over me and I looking angry. Any way in the end I lost my driving privileges for 2 years and it cost 4000 bucks in fines and surcharges. Xanax are fun, but dont take more than 2 bars and not too often. AND : NEVER EVER DRIVE ON XANAX .<!-- End Body -->
