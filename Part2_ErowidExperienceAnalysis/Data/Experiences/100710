***Caution*** The dosage report you are about to read is considered thirty times the safe and recommended dose. Do not try this under any circumstances. We are experienced psychonauts and have a strong tolerance to this drug.<br>
<br>
 <span class='erowid-warning'>[Erowid Note: 
The dose described in this report is very high, potentially beyond Erowid's 'heavy' range, and could pose serious health risks or result in unwanted, extreme effects. Sometimes extremely high doses reported are errors rather than actual doses used.]</span> <br>
<br>
People call me Cowboy, myself, and my BFF, code name Gypsy, are traveling vendors at music festivals. The story you are about to read is our most recent adventure that took place at 'The Great Blue Heron' music festival.<br>
<br>
After the first night we had sold or given away almost all of our doses of NBO. The next day people were coming from everywhere to shake our hands and give us hugs and thank us for the amazing time they had the night before. They said the music filled their souls with light, the food tasted better than anything they had ever known, sex was a religious experience, even going to the restroom was a great adventure.<br>
<br>
Riding an electric high, and feeling super good because we had made so many people happy, we decided that night 2 we were going to push the envelope and see where this crazy substance would take us. This is a summary of our experience, as best as I can remember.<br>
<br>
9pm (5,000ug I-NBO/ 220mg MDMA)- we finally sold out and decided it was time to party. we each took 5 doses of 1000ug NBO and a 220mg MDMA Lambo from the man, X4U. 20 minutes later we were in Nirvana.<br>
<br>
11pm (5,000ug I-NBO)- At the drum circle on the war path music was a visible wave. We were surrounded by white energy emanating from the people. Everyone was on another plane. We were having strong open and closed eye visuals along with an intense body buzz that could be compared to an orgasm. But we were not close to finished. We new if we wanted to feel this way until sun up we needed to re-dose. Re-dose we did.<br>
<br>
12pm (10,000ug I-NBO)- The previous 5mg enabled us to maintain this amazing ride we were on, it truly was a living, breathing, bliss. But Gypsy and I have a tendency to push the envelope. We new that the feeling we were experiencing was not as far as we could take it, so at midnight, under the milky way, to the sound of a hundred djembe beating in unison, beating just for us, we doubled our dose. <br>
<br>
2am (10,000ug I-NBO/ 220mg MDMA)- I can't put into words the absolute ecstasy we were experiencing after the 2am dose. It was as if our bodies no longer existed. We were living energy, riding a current from person to person, experience to experience, like electricity arcing across pieces of metal. Everywhere we went there was pure joy and contentment. It was as if for just the briefest of moments we were all one soul, one love, and it was the greatest experience of our lives. I have never felt so alive, so free of pain and regret, we only lived in the moment and it was true bliss. The world around us no longer carried any resemblance of the reality we left. People had turned into animals, angels, living plants, and the neon lights that illuminated the warpath were something similar to what Alice saw when she fell down the rabbit hole. Trees talked and moved like people, the ground was a soft sponge that welcomed our feet into it, instead of meeting it with force and gravity. The music was visible and a multi-colored spectal wave. Gypsy and I had truly broken through the doors of perception while still conscious. <br>
<br>
5am (10,000ug I-NBO)- by 5am the body buzz had left us, the energy was gone, the ride was over. We were living in a painting much like a Picasso, but were nearly sober accept for the world existing in brush strokes. The last 10,000ug did nothing. I think our bodies were completely spent. We had sweat gallons of water, and were completely and utterly exhausted. I crawled into my tent and went to sleep. Content to dream of the night i just had and already looking forward to the next Heron to come. <br>
<br>
Our experience was a good one because we are very experienced trippers, not just with hallucinogens, but with this drug in particular. I have seen old acid heads completely puddled and seizing off of this substance at 3000ug. I can't stress enough not to abuse this drug like we have. It affects everyone differently.<br>
<br>
That being said now we can talk about the after effects. We were husks of human beings for about 4 days after. Muscle cramping and convulsions, eye twitching, numbness in fingers and toes, irregular bowls and extremely vivid dreams, like a conscious unconscious.<br>
<br>
Everyone who tried it loved it, everyone wanted more to take home, wanted phone numbers we couldn't provide. This is a wonderful drug. But it is dangerous. I believe it has the power to heal sick minds, as my entire outlook on life changed after I started taking it. I put my family back together, removed myself from the grip of depression, and found peace with myself after the war in Iraq. I love it, and I recommend it to everyone. But this is not a drug you can just shovel in your mouth. You have to doggy paddle before you can swim, or you will drown. Thanks for taking the time to read our story and be safe out there. Also if you are ever at a music festival and see a Cowboy in a straw hat and a Gypsy in a fedora, stop and say high. :)<!-- End Body -->
