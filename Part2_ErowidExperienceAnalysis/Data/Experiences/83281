Don't want to make it too long. I'll try my best. If you want to skip the story you can go to the main point in the end.<br>
<br>
First of all, I'm 20 and I've been diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder. At first I tried to deal with my problems on my own, but eventually succeeded in smoking weed and hash for one year which made my head problems worse. I then gave my health in the hands of the 'professional'. Took all the drugs he gave me, like Wellbutrin, Paxil, Ativan, Remeron and some others. They did not work at all. While all this was happening I started researching a thing or two about depression, human brain, drugs and how they work. It is then when I realized that psychiatrists and other mental doctors don't really know what they are doing. None of them could tell you the exact mechanism of depression, anxiety and others psyche problems, so they hand out drugs which are believed to cure depression, and its all nothing but a method of trials and errors. <br>
<br>
I stopped seeing my doc, and I should mention that I live in Latvia. Shit country, but if you know how to, you can by a lot of interesting drugs in pharmacy's without prescription. And relatively cheap. Most antidepressants for less then 25$, codeine/paracetamol 30/500 mg for like 5 bucks. And many many more. I also have a lot of friends who can score some benzos, tramadol or speed, also not to pricey. <br>
<br>
In summer 2009 I decided to quit smoking cigs, smoking weed, drinking anything with caffeine (I don't even eat chocolate anymore). DXM also traveled in my ban list some time ago. I did it because these substances gave more bad than good for me. This summer I tried speed for the first time, but wasn't impressed at all. And in August I found one drug, that turned my life around. Benadryl. As simple as that. It somehow destroyed my depression and anxiety very effectively, which speed, alcohol, DXM, weed and other stuff couldn't. My grades went up, I could socialize with people again. Couple of those pills made me apathetic and happy about everything, they made me sleep like an angel, and greatly improved my orgasms and sex drive. I had no more depression. So I decided try speed one more time. Took a couple of benadryls as usual, snorted a couple of big lines and in 5 minutes could feel how the hair on the back of my head is getting up. Now that was one hell of a night. I never tried E, but I was soooo happy, talkative (not just mumbling all the time, but I could listen to people, feel their problems and wanted to share mine). I also consumed a fair amount of alcohol that night, but leaving the apartment when there was <i>so much left to discuss</i> was a big bummer. To my surprise I was the king of the world everywhere I went. I carried a girl through the all city, danced like no others and shared my most intimate stuff with my friends. When compared to my first amphetamine use it was day and night, although the amount consumed wasn't much greater, and the speed was good both times. <br>
<br>
I knew that antihistaminic activity of Benadryl couldn't provide all this bonuses to my life, because I tried Remeron and other antihistamines with no success, so to make the long story short. It's Benadryl ability to antagonize Muscarinic receptors. I believe M1 receptor is the most important. After that summer I did speed 20 or more times at parties and weekends. Most of this times I had a very close intimate conversations with different people. Before this summer I did not wanted to share my problems with people, but now almost all my friends know everything about me, like when I use Speed+M1 antagonist I am not afraid of being absolutely naked in emotional and psychological way in front of them. <br>
<br>
Many stuff happened this autumn and winter. I did DXD, a lot of drinking, codeine up to 300 mg many times, but it all was just for fun. I wasn't as depressed as before, I don't have addictive personality, and always know when to stop. <br>
<br>
So, my main point: I always did speed with M1 antagonist since that summer. My highs from speed was bigger, longer and more emotional than all of my friends highs. I bought a bag of speed today to study all night for my exam. I am also taking tianeptin right now (which is a serotonin reuptake enchancer, thus raising my dopamine levels in important parts of your brain) but it does not interact with drugs much, except making codeine high 100 times better. And I wasn't taking any muscarinic antagonists like Benadryl this time. I made an experiment, and here's the result:<br>
<br>
Snorting 4 nice lines gave me the rush, but wasn’t  as intense as usual, and wore off a lot quicker. This was a lot worse that all of my previous times. I then took some Dicyclomine (I believe it is called Bentyl in USA and UK), which act as M1 muscarinic selective antagonist. And boom, all the jitteriness’ and other bad side effect subsides when Dicyclomine hit my brain. My heart rate slowed down and everything in the world was perfect. I could do anything, and eventually understood everything I couldn't about math in 3 months in 3 hours. My friends visited me, and I was like Oprah, knowing what to say, what to ask, so everybody talked to me, and I had no problems keeping the conversation. They invited me to have fun with them several times, but I declined, since I needed to study. They eventually convinced me, and we had a great time together, and even composed a song (I play guitar and sing also). When I went back to my room I felt like alone, because everyone was doing what any normal person would do on Wednesday 3.p.m. – sleeping. Depression washed over me, I did more lines but it was worthless. I felt alone, and wanted to talk to someone, like a scared dog sitting at my laptop trying to understand something from my math to no avail. I then took some more Dicyclomine and bang! I felt great again! Wrote this report, and will do some more speed, finish with my math and do something else!<br>
<br>
And it is nice to know that studies shown that M1 antagonist lower amphetamines induced neurotoxicity! That's nice. I wonder is it just my special brain chemistry, because I can't find reports about this combo. From the science point of view – acetylcholine (M1 agonist) and dopamine have some kind of relationship. Because there are antiparkinson drugs which act as M1 antagonists to level dopamine/acetylcholine concentrations in human brain. <br>
<br>
Muscarinic antagonists - Benadryl, Bentyl (dicyclomine), Oxybutynin and some others.<!-- End Body -->
