A while ago, a few friends of mine and I were heading up to a private party thrown in the mountains. The weather couldn’t have been any better. The skies were crystal-clear. Not a cloud to be seen anywhere. We had just arrived and the sun had started to set over the tall mountain peaks. Immediately, it started to get really cold. There was a room set up in an old shack that was standing up nearby. Power generators were outside, providing the room to be heated with space-heaters. Nearby, there was a cave entrance, where generators were set up and wires were thrown in. I could hear faint music going on, and I knew there was a big party going on inside. <br>
<br>
********<br>
<br>
First, I found a 20 mg tablet of 2c-B and consumed that around 10, saw some lovely pattern shifting. Nothing too impressive, but around 12 midnight, I took 2 hits of acid on top of that. I walked into the cave and started seeing things on the walls. A kandy kid girl who was bothering me the entire night to see if I had found some E was walking with me and latched on to my arms. She had found some, and I could tell. We walked past the party inside the cave and to a point where we were deep in the cave. I really started to peak at this point, and I was seeing worms on the cave ground everywhere. I knew I was hallucinating, so there were no actual worms. For some reason, when I walked out of the cave, it was 2. I have no idea how I wasted two hours just peaking on acid without even knowing it, but I when I walked outside, everything seemed different. The stars were moving around in the sky, and I could only see a few certain ones.<br>
<br>
Outside, people were playing with a flaming tether-ball around a tetherball court they had made. I watched a man get hit by the ball in the face, and what looked like he had been covered in fire. I focused again, and they were all right. Nobody had gotten hit. I walked back on to the chill room where everybody was just sitting down, relaxing, listening to ambient music. Outside of that room, there was a campfire going. I really started to lose it when I forgot who I was, what day it was, and what time. I pretty much thought I didn’t exist, and I was stuck in a world only known to myself. Colors shifted, patterns flying over my head, and everything in between. This happened for what I thought was around 5 or 6 hours. The entire time, I even remember talking to people inside and outside the room, but I was not there. I was looking for my friends to see if I could find anybody I knew, but nobody was around. I couldn’t relate to anything. I didn’t even know where I was.<br>
<br>
Around 7 in the morning, I actually ran into a few friends of mine who I knew from a rave I went to before then. As hard as I was tripping, I actually had a normal conversation with them. It seemed really weird, because the more people I knew that came back to talk to me, the more I was coming down off the acid. I finally found my friends who were out in their own little world on too many mushrooms and alcohol… they found me. We started wrapping things up getting ready to go home. The acid finally peaked one more time when my friend stated she needed to use the bathroom. As she was walking away, all of a sudden, everybody around me started peeing. Guy on the roof was peeing outside the chill room, there was a guy next to me peeing, and all around, everybody was peeing. They all come back up at the same time and start to do the pee-pee dance. Weird. Then my friend comes back and she goes “Man, I had to walk a half a mile before I could find a spot to pee. Everybody was doing it too”. Pretty much that just fucked up with my head. <br>
<br>
***<br>
<br>
The sun came up. Possibly the most beautiful thing I’ve ever seen in my life. It looked like it was coming up from every direction on the horizon. North, south, east and west. The mountains reflected the light in the colors they possessed. The lighter it got, the more everything came back to normal. I looked at a bush next to me which was losing its leaves. The autumn season was changing the colors, and I saw the frost melting slowly off of it. Touching something that cold seemed so different to me. I don’t know why. <br>
<br>
Finally, we headed out, and went back home. I still couldn’t drive until after I was at my friend’s house, so I passed out on their couch for a few hours. I couldn’t believe that I was so out of it, that when I came to, I was still hallucinating over 15 hours later. I got up after that, and went home. That was probably one of the wildest nights of my life.<!-- End Body -->
