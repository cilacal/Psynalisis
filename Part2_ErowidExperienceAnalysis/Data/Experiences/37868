It was a beautiful sunny day and after reading some reports online I decided it would be the perfect time to try my first solo 2ci trip. Previously I had taken 2ci at 12.5mg once and at 15mg three times and so I was fairly certain of the effects I would recieve and that I would be ok on my own. I swallowed the dose in a capsule at 2pm and proceeded to go out the back and find a nice sunny spot to relax. <br>
<br>
The phone rang and I decided to answer it and it was my friend seeing if I wanted to go to the beach with him and another of our friends. This kinda changed my plans for the afternoon but Piha beach is just too beautiful to pass up so I gladly accepted. They picked me up just as I was starting to feel some alerts at around 1 hour after ingestion and we had to run a few errands before heading out. This included going to the bank and heading over to a friend to pick up some cannabis. <br>
<br>
All in all it took us 2 hours to get to the beach so for the second hour of the drive I was starting to really feel the effects of the drug. It was amazing because all my previous experiences with 2ci have never presented such amazing feelings as this one. I think the beautiful weather had something to do with it but my body was going through waves of awesome euphoria not unlike mdma but still distinctly different. I was not experiencing much visual activity when we got out of the car except for enhanced colours. <br>
<br>
At the beach we found a nice spot and smoked four or five cones of excellent cannabis which for me was the catalyst for the main event. As the weed kicked in I just sat back and looked at my surroundings and suddenly everything was alive. In the distance trees blowing in the wind were covered in a shadow type effect which swayed and undulated making them look like the ocean. Massive cliff faces were flowing and shifting as if made from liquid and the clouds in the sky were going through some serious twisting and warping with some slight colour changing. It was an amazing sight and was so much better than anything I have previously felt on this drug. <br>
<br>
Previous experiments have all been at night time and have had a more toxic/artificial feel to them with most effects being felt after doing nitrous but during the day it no longer felt like a chemical. The effect slowly came on and felt like any other organic drug out there, and I hesitate to say this but I actually had a similar feeling to a really nice daytime mushroom trip I had without some of the more serious mind bending. I also experienced some levels of insight this trip like sitting on a the rocks at the beach and imagining the world from their time frame. Without even knowing it I could have been sitting on a collapse or major geological shift due to the amount of time these things take. I think this insight was brought on by the fact that the dramatic scenery at our location pretty much shows you what has happened over thousands of years. You can see where cliffs have collapsed and where entire chunks of land have separated from the mainland and sunk into the sand. It is a truly amazing place.<br>
<br>
My mind frame throughout the experience was almost perfect and was heavily influenced by the initial stages of the afternoon spent in the backseat of the car. It was the perfect metaphor for my afternoon just being in the back seat and letting other people take care of the situation as usually I am the person who drives and generally organises things.<br>
<br>
So we stayed at the beach for about one and a half hours and then headed back, stopping at Wendy's on the way home. I must note that at this dose, and having smoked plenty of bud, interaction in public was a little awkward. Simple things like the girl asking me to step foward to order were confusing and all throughout the day at different public locations I seemed to see people at the extreme end of each stereotype. I could see them and felt I could almost pinpoint exactly what sort of people they were and what sort of things they liked to do. This was also noted while watching people talk. I could clearly pick up on things I would otherwise have completely ignored like little facial expressions which could give away what the person was really feeling. The girls who served us was rather tall and skinny and seemed very shy and I felt as though I could see her projecting her inner feelings. When she made a mistake with our order and my friend asked her to change it I could see the embarrasment just pour out of her but it was as if nobody else saw it. This aspect was one of the most incredible aspects of the trip, one which I have not experienced in other settings.<br>
<br>
All in all this was by far my most enjoyable and rewarding experience with 2ci. I will definitely be taking it during the day again and almost certainly in the outdoors as these factors seemed to bring out so much more from the drug. I feel now that my ideal dosage would be around 17-18mg as at 15mg nothing really overwhelmed me and I feel the peak activity would be a little more exciting with a small dose increase. After five experiences with this substance I can safely say that the best way to approach the drug is to do your research, get in the back seat and enjoy the ride.<br>
<br>
Peace.<!-- End Body -->
