I ordered a gram of amanita muscaria 25x resin, I'd been thinking about trying this mushroom, but since I partied so much in years past, I figured I would bypass the actual mushrooms and just go straight to the concentrated form.  <br/>
<br/>
I was so excited when it arrived.  I've used psychedelics before, peyote, magic mushrooms, acid, etc.  So I spent 3 days preparing for my 'trip', with meditation, making sure my mind was in the right place to do this.  From one horrific trip many years ago (on blotter acid), I learned to prepare myself mentally for my little 'adventures'.  So anyways....    <br/>
<br/>
The place I bought the resin from said to start with 1/2 a gram.  I don't have scales, so I just 'eyeballed' the resin into three fairly equal blobs, scooped it up and put it into 3 capsules.<br/>
<br/>
12:30pm  I took one capsule, with 2 pieces of candied ginger right beforehand to eliminate any problems with nausea.  (can get the candied ginger at your grocery store, in the produce department usually).  I sat there, all excited, thinking, ok, this is going to be FUN.  Well, I waited for the recommended two hours, for it to kick in, but still, nothing happened.  At about 1 1/2 hours, I thought I felt something, but then it didn't go anywhere.  So basically, nada.  But no nausea either, so that much is good.  I despise throwing up!!!  <br/>
<br/>
2:30 pm  'Ok, this isn't working.'  So I took the second capsule.  Waited rather impatiently this time. <br/>
<br/>
3:00 pm  Damn!  This isn't going to work!  Took the last capsule.  Totally disappointed. There went $16 down the toilet.  Kind of getting grouchy about the whole thing, lol. <br/>
<br/>
3:30 pm  Hmmm...music's starting to actually get into my head, sounds really incredible.  Wow, I think it's starting to work finally.  Cool!  <br/>
<br/>
4:00 pm  Life is so beautiful.  I can feel every beat of the music in my blood, in my muscles, in every cell of my body.  Swaying to the beat, in my chair, I'm losing all sense of time.  After this point, I can't give any timelines, because time simply didn't matter any more.  I remember thinking that I felt so incredibly happy inside, all I wanted to do was dance to the music.  I have no idea how long I danced for, but it was incredible.  Keep in mind, I HATE dancing.  Normally I have two left feet, but the music literally felt like it was inside me.  Piece of cake, this dancing bit! :)  <br/>
<br/>
Some time later, after the dancing bit, I felt such peace inside.  I felt like I literally became one with everything in the universe, I became the wall, I became the sofa, I became the painting on the wall, I became my house, I became the sky.  It was the most incredible feeling I've ever experienced, bar none.<br/>
<br/>
I spent the last part of the trip meditating, on the couch.  I don't remember much of what happened there, but I do remember feeling like I was talking to God (mohammed, allah, jehovah, by whatever name you call the creator of the universe) and the feeling that, even in the negative experiences we have in our lives, that it ALL serves a purpose.  'Everything IS as it should be' type of feeling, it was something I've never felt before, in all my years of tripping.  A voice in my head, telling me that I needed to relax and just go with it (my life experiences).  My body felt really strange, I got it into my head that I could feel the bones in my forearms, and how wonderful it felt, to be able to feel that.  I don't remember all of it, but later, I ended up feeling extremely cold, so I crawled into bed and got under 3 blankets to get warm.  That's pretty much the last thoughts/actions I remember having, because apparently I fell asleep.  <br/>
<br/>
I woke up around 10:30 pm?  I don't remember what I dreamed, but I woke up feeling absolutely fantastic.  Very much at peace with everything.  Very contented.  The only two negatives I experienced, was the coldness during my experience, and later that night, itching during my sleep.  I must have itched terribly that night (although I don't remember it) because I dug the hell out of my back and arms.  I had a some gut cramps later that night, around midnight, and a couple bouts of diarreah.  But compared to what I felt and experienced?  I can live with having to take an immodium pill afterwards. <br/>
<br/>
I went a little too easy on the dosing though, even though they recommended 1/2 a gram to start, I wanted to start out easy, in case it made me throw up.  So I did it by thirds, but once it did get going?  Hold on!!<br/>
<br/>
Would I do it again?  Well, although I experienced none of the typical visuals that psychedelics can *typically* give, the body buzz, and the mind trip it gave me are beyond describing.  So I am *definitely* planning on doing this again. I'll change my dosing a bit next time too, so that should help. <br/>
<br/>
It was an INCREDIBLE experience!!!!<!-- End Body -->
