As you can see, I am 18 years old, 225 pounds, and 6 feet tall. I have never smoked marijuana or done any sort of drug to get 'high' before. The only thing I have done that is even remotely close to getting 'high' is smoking unfiltered tobacco, which gave me a slight 'buzz' as some people may call it.<br>
<br>
Many of my friends smoke marijuana and have pressured me to try it with them. In an effort to not break any laws, I bought some Serenity Now online. It is my belief that it contains JWH-018, however it does not say anything about it on the package. I received it in the mail within a few days.<br>
<br>
I made a homemade bong out of a glass bottle, a pen, and a 4 millimeter socket wrench piece. The socket wrench piece is what I consider 'a bowl.' I packed as much Serenity Now as I could into the 'bowl,' lit it, and took a hit. I didn't feel anything so I proceeded to light it again and take a few more hits. The smoke was very smooth and I did not cough at all.  At first, I felt a slight head buzz and I couldn't help but smile. I was thinking, 'Whoa. Am I high?' After about 5 more minutes the back of my throat started going numb. It almost felt like my throat was tightening, as if I was suffocating, but I knew I could still breathe perfectly fine. I became a little nervous. Then my heart or the area around my heart started becoming numb. This made me more nervous. I went from a state of happiness to slight paranoia and fear. After I got over that it felt as if I were dreaming. Everything I did felt like it was a dream, and I kept asking my self 'Is this real? Is this really happening? Did I really just do that?' It seemed as if everything was happening twice. The first time, it's just me performing a normal action. The second time, I would feel like I had just dreamed about what happened the first time. For example, I got on my computer and started typing something. Every time I typed one letter, it felt like I typed it twice, but the second time it just felt like a dream. Everything happening twice felt like it took some effect on my coordination. <br>
<br>
I attempted to walk in a straight line. I walked in a straight line almost perfectly but my mind felt like I was about to fall over every time I took a step. It was as if my muscles had minds of their own and had perfect coordination, but my actual mind had poor coordination. After all of this I started getting a bit more stressed and paranoid about getting in trouble or getting caught. At the time I felt the best solution was to just lay down and try to relax. After I laid down in my bed I stared at the ceiling and it felt like my eyes were pulsating. I still had the feeling of numbness in my heart and throat. The more I thought about it, the number it got. Somehow I found out that this feeling of 'numbness' could actually be controlled and moved around to any part of my body. I soon discovered that this feeling wasn't just 'numbness,' it was actually quite pleasurable. I then proceeded to move this 'orb of sensation' around my entire body, massaging each of my toes, feet, legs, arms, head, and etc. It is hard to keep it in one spot, but with enough focus it can be done.<br>
<br>
This next part may sound perverted or inappropriate, but since it was part of my experience I figured I should include it in this report.<br>
<br>
I proceeded to move this orb of sensation, well, 'down south,' if you will. This is where I then discovered that I could increase and elevate this feeling of pleasure. It was a struggle to keep it held in the same spot, but I focused a lot and kept it there. It felt like I was about to have an orgasm, but not quite. I also found that it was a lot easier to imagine things, almost as if you were hallucinating, but able to control what you hallucinate and how. I then proceeded to imagining having sexual intercourse with an attractive girl, and this increased the pleasure. Then I began to masturbate to the point of climax. I was still keeping the 'orb' in the same spot. I experienced what was probably the longest and most intense orgasm I have ever felt in my entire life. I was able to maintain the orgasm for at least 5 minutes. I know I could have held it longer if I wanted to though.<br>
<br>
I have no idea what it feels like to be high on marijuana seeing as I have never smoked it, but I have never heard of any of my friends describing something like this while high on marijuana. I have never done any other illegal drugs like LSD or shrooms to go on a 'trip,' but if I had to describe Serenity Now and it's effects, I would definitely call it a 'trip' and not just a 'high,' based on my current understanding of the two.<!-- End Body -->
