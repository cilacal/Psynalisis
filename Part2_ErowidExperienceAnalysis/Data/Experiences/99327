Before I get started, I would like to point out that I made a couple of critical errors during the build up to my journey. This account is being written for the purpose that it might help others not make the same mistakes.<br/>
<br/>
I was somewhere around Poco Loco, on the edge of Chatham, when the drugs began to take hold.<br/>
<br/>
Around midday on a Friday I began the long train journey home from my place of work to my brother and his girlfriend's flat, I met my Fiancé there. To speed the journey up I had been drinking, quite heavily, putting away 9 550ml cans of 5% cider. The plan for the evening was to dose with 2C-I, and show my fiancé (who is anti drug use) that I was completely competent whilst under the influence of 'drugs' and that she had nothing to worry about when I decided that I wanted to trip.<br/>
<br/>
I believe being drunk was my first error, my judgement was impaired and I adopted a rather cavalier attitude. There was a large gig being put on a couple of houses down from my brothers place, and we’d decided that it would be fun to check it out. I had previously taken 2CB before and was anticipating very similar results with 2Ci. My second error (and definitely the most severe error) came when I tried to measure a small dose (3-5 mg) by eye of which I planned to take by route of insufflation. The hit I had was probably closer to 12 mg, with that route of entry is a very strong hit indeed.<br/>
<br/>
<span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Two samples of powder (even of the same chemical) with equivalent volumes won't necessarily weigh the same. For this reason, eyeballing is an inaccurate and potentially dangerous method of measuring, particularly for substances that are active in very small amounts.
See <a href="/psychoactives/basics/basics_measuring1.shtml">this article on The Importance of Measured Doses</a>.]</span><br/>
<br/>
I started to come up within 5 minutes at 22:00. <br/>
<br/>
+0: Administered the hit, walked around a bit trying not to sneeze.<br/>
<br/>
+3: started to see trails from moving objects like cars, hands, my finacé…<br/>
<br/>
+5: extreme nausea, sat down, took deep breaths of fresh air, head was spinning quite fast.<br/>
<br/>
+8: Went into the gig, was extremely hectic, started experiencing severe muscle relaxation resulting in feeling as though I needed the toilet, asked my brother if I could quickly pop back upstairs to use the bathroom. We got upstairs, and I started to experience severe disorientation, the floor was rolling violently, creating large lumps in the carpet as the walls swayed and rocked in unison.<br/>
<br/>
+15: I lay on his couch, experiencing even more OEV’s, he has a glass chandelier type light, lights were bouncing off this and creating some really nice patterns. I called my friend (whom I’d taken 2cb with the previous New Years Eve) maintaining conversation was hard, and my phone started to feel like water in my hands, making it nearly impossible to hold on to. I put some music on (LSD by 1200mgs) I’ve listened to the album to great lengths, but it sounded like a completely different track, unrecognisable. I’d like to mention at this point that the times I’ve dosed with the 2C drugs music, especially psy-trance, has been absolutely incredible to listen to. <br/>
<br/>
+20: The trip took a rather drastic turn here. I was plunged into a cartoon world of menacing faces and endless repetitive patterns. I thought I had passed out or slipped into a slumber, later to be told that my eyes were wide open and I was talking, walking about the flat and responding to questions (rather incoherently, but responding all the same). Unfortunately from here on in, I lost all concept of time and reality being immersed in 100% OEV for several hours.<br/>
<br/>
It started with me conversing with my fiancé, I was making some fantastic connections and break through discoveries about relationships and love, culminating in having a visual display of my love for her (this was in the form of a spectacular pattern that erupted from me and surrounded us both as we engaged in a loving embrace).<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
I went deeper into my own thoughts, now unaware of temperature and anything around me. I started seeing how my own thoughts were being created, most of them selfish thoughts with regard for only myself, and no-one else around me. Through-out I was posed with the question: would you give up everything you are and have in order to be one with your partner? An easy question to answer yes to, but yes wasn’t the answer my brain was looking for, it seemed that it wanted a physical display of love and devotion to prove myself to her. This menacing pattern re-occurred for some time, and I felt my movements being restricted (previously I was able to move around my thoughts and see what was happening all the time). <br/>
<br/>
It was at this point that I lost grasp of the knowledge that I had taken a drug, resulting in me panicking about the my state of mind. To help me out, my brain started projecting more visuals to aid in me thinking this. Seeing a scene where I was sat on the bathroom floor in a straight jacket, surrounded by white coats with concerned looking faces peering in. The scene vanished and I was plunged deeper in to thought. <br/>
<br/>
I made a link that my direct control of thought was effecting the world around me, and every time I thought of something horrid, it would happen to the people around me. This is where I saw a reflection of my lazy attitude towards life. If I was responsible for the world, my immature attitude and careless nature would surely result in the end of the world, sure enough I was presented with an image of me sat in the middle of a city, surrounded by death and decay. This sparked some anger and uncontrollable rage within me, I felt myself hitting things and throwing things in a childish tantrum, (later to be told that I got up and started throwing tables and chairs around the apartment).<br/>
<br/>
The scene switched again, and I was presented with an image of myself in a mental asylum, with grey hair, looking vacant, I proceeded to enter my own head within this image. There were endless menacing patterns and pictures, I saw myself inside my own brain, although I did not resemble a person, I was a morphing shape, changing from a ball into a square, into a face and so on. I couldn’t move. There was a single word rotating around my head “eternity”. Again I started to panic about my mental state of mind. <br/>
<br/>
My memory falters here, I am unsure how I escaped the hellish surrounding. I remember something happened, I felt like I achieved an answer and that was sufficient payment to return to the previous level.<br/>
<br/>
There I was, alone in a room, having conversations with pictures and faces, always receiving identical answers, and repeating the same conversation. I’m told at certain points I said “Am I trying to explain this, or are you explaining this?” which fits with what I was seeing. Again I couldn’t move, and surrendered to the menacing thought that I had indeed lost my mind. It was a semi comforting thought, and I relaxed my whole body, knowing that I wouldn’t need to move anymore, and someone would be taking care of me. (possibly influenced by my fiancé saying “I’ve worked with old people before, I’ll sort this out”<br/>
<br/>
I’m told I was like this for some 4 hours.<br/>
<br/>
I kept advancing through layers of psyche and with each break through, things became more real. I had a strong smell of vomit around me, and I’m told that I spuriously threw up intermittently. I once again remembered that I’d taken a drug. I could hear re-assuring words from my fiancé, brother and his girlfriend. I heard his girlfriend say “do you want this to be over now?” Which resulted in me killing myself inside a mental asylum. I then received a large cold bucket of water to the face and body, which transposed into me being reborn. I then had some fantastic moments in my own head with my fiancé, holding onto her as tightly as possible. I could feel warmth again. I was covered with water however, and due to the way I had killed myself I felt I was lying in a bloody pool with many cuts over me. I could see paramedics and faces peering in, looking disappointed and angry. I said out loud “I deserve this”. Which received a cumulative “aww” from the curious onlookers. I heard my fiancé say “rest now, its easier that way”. I rested for about 10 minutes, during which I asked her to be closer to me (she was already clutching me like a child), when she said she couldn’t, I asked her to be inside me. <br/>
<br/>
Soon after I came too lying on the kitchen floor, quite wet, and cold. I put on some warm clothes and retired to the couch with my fiancé. Finally I was experiencing what I had hoped to experience in the first place. Gentle OEV’s, and a warm glow as people spoke around me.<br/>
<br/>
The drug is powerful, I would highly recommend some micro-scales to measure out accurate doses, if I had been on my own I could have done some serious harm. I also vomited and could have easily choked. I had some fantastic help from my Fiancé, Brother and his girlfriend. <br/>
<br/>
I can't say I enjoyed this trip, I wasn’t prepared for a full OEV experience like that and it has shaken me up quite badly to the extent that I’m not sure if I will dose with the 2C’s anymore. The things that really unnerved me, was the fact I couldn’t hold onto the thought that I had taken a drug, and that I had no control over where my own thoughts took me. <br/>
<br/>
Lessons learnt: don’t drink prior to tripping, and never measure out a small dose such as 3MG by eye.<!-- End Body -->
