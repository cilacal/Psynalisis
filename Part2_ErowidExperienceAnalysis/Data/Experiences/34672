being 16 years old, it would be safe to say I have not had much experience with psychedelics, or really any drugs other than marijuana and a few legal highs.  I'm not a real big partier, and don't like doing drugs to 'be a rebel' or to 'get fucked up'.  Psychodelics always appealed to me, because of all i had read about mind expansion, etc.  So when my friend approached me with 5-MeO-DMT, a drug with a short trip and strong affects, I seized the opportunity.<BR>
<BR>
Sitting in my bedroom, we pull out the aluminum foil apparatus.  We had no way of precisely measuring our dose, so we decided to start with one grain of the powder and move up until we felt something.  My friend goes first.  He puts the flame under the foil, melting/burning the drug.  smoke raises faster than he can inhale and the hit is gone.  My turn.  Same thing happens.<BR>
<BR>
We go back and forth for another hit or so and we are both feeling very euphoric.  Comparable to feeling fairly high on marijuana.  Then it's my turn again, and I get the first REAL hit on a fairly large amount of the stuff.  I hold it in, blow the smoke out, and look at my friend.  he is laughing at me.  i tell him<BR>
<BR>
'holy shit'<BR>
<BR>
The first few minutes of my trip cannot be explained any other way than sheer panic.  I wasn't prepared for what i was feeling,  I went from feeling nothing to a full blown trip.  I had trouble breathing, and couldn't speak at all.  My friend turned on ambient music, but any sound at all was making the panic worse.  I felt sick.  i managed to tell him to turn off the music and the fan, and we sat in silance as i lay in a recliner, rocking my head back in forth with my eyes closed.<BR>
<BR>
After the room became silent and i managed to get a hold of myself, it was a VERY enjoyable experience, though I'm unable to put it all into words.  I felt as though i had melted into the chair i was sitting in, and could not stop rocking my head.  It had seemed as though a long time had passed, but it had been 10 minutes.  I looked at my friend, and gave him the biggest smile i have ever smiled.  For awile I was unable to speak, as i couldn't hold a train of thought at all.  More time passes, and I feel mentally up to speed.  I stand up to exchange spots with my friend so he can have his turn.  Jelly legs.  I almost fell over, but managed to make it to my bed.  My friend decides not to load a lot on the foil, and takes a hit.  I have no idea wether or not he felt anything or not, but i sure know i did. <BR>
<BR>
I had never done any psychedelics prior to doing that, which exlains the panic i felt.  All in all, i'm very glad i tried 5-MeO -DMT, but I would hesitate to do it again until i had had more experience with drugs of that nature.<!-- End Body -->
