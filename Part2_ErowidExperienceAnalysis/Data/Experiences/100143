Frightening 25i Experience<br/>
<br/>
My friend had purchased two tabs of 25i, and asked if I would want to try some with him. I told him I had heard of several people having negative experiences from the substance, and that these negative effects were increased with an increase of dose. 'Let's just split a tab first.' I said. I cut the tab evenly in half, and at 7:30 pm, we both ceremoniously placed the tabs on our tongues. The effects of 25i did not kick in until about 80-90 minutes after consumption. <div class="pullquote-right1"><div class="pullquote-text">The effects of 25i did not kick in until about 80-90 minutes after consumption.</div></div> We both kept the tabs in our mouth the whole time.<br/>
     <br/>
As I began to peak, I got the giggles. I felt wired, and uneasy. After an hour or so, the giggles went away, and I started to feel very anxious and still wired. At 12:00am, my friend went home. I was left in my house with my parents. This didn't bother me much, but my negative feelings began to worsen. Things began to 'breathe' as I would stare, and shadows in the corner of the room began to move.<br/>
     <br/>
Long story short, I stayed up all night long on my couch, surrounded by lots of pillows and blankets, and my cats as I watched freaks and geeks. Because I had tripped on psychedelics such as LSD, DMT, and mushrooms, I was able to convince myself that the visual hallucinations were unreal, but I noticed that it was far more difficult than it was to do on other psychedelics. <br/>
     <br/>
Around 3:30 am, I began to have a difficult time breathing, I suspect this was an anxiety attack. I could only catch my breath when I would yawn. My nose also began to bleed a little around this time. I tried to remain calm and just ride out the trip. At this time, I was not having many visual hallucinations but my body still felt pretty trippy. <br/>
     <br/>
I finally passed out around 6 am, I woke up with little to no hangover to my surprise. I would advise anyone considering taking this drug to be very cautious with the dose, start out with half a tab. I have read that the results vary greatly even with a person taking the same dose on a different occasion. All I know is that I will never be taking this again!<!-- End Body -->
