Before I start the story about the experience I want to first explain my background a little with chemicals and plants. Over the last three years of my life I made it my mission to experience the world in as many ways possible and to see the world for what it really is. This desire lead me to trying a wide variety of substances. Many of the substances have been consumed many times at varying dosages. These include, LSD, 2C-B, 2C-E,2C-I, 4-AcO-DMT, Mescaline, Mushrooms, DMT (smoked and eaten with Syrian Rue), MDA, MDMA, DOC, MXE, 25I-NBome, and Nitrous.<br>
<br>
The Setting<br>
<br>
My girlfriend and I were told by a friend that he had a Vial of the best LSD he'd ever taken. Naturally my girlfriend and I thought we better get over to check it out before it was all gone. We arrived at my friend's house and were greeted by him and his girlfriend. We proceeded to sit down around a table to catch up and smoke a little hash. Then my friend's gf went to their bedroom and brought out a small plastic dropper with a clear liquid substance filling the dropper. She claimed it was the 'best lsd' that she got from family. Naturally I was skeptical as I rarely find real LSD in my area.<br>
<br>
Time of Dose - approx 10p.m.<br>
<br>
I would place time markers for this experience but Time is a joke during this; I was totally outside of Time/Reality as you will soon read.<br>
<br>
The Experience<br>
<br>
My friend placed two drops of liquid underneath my tongue and told me to let it absorb underneath my tongue, not to swallow. He also placed two drops underneath my gf's tongue with the same instruction. We sat back down at the table and continued to talk about the past week and also to do a few nitrous balloons. Approximately 15 minutes after the drops were placed under the tongue the effects of the liquid could be clearly felt and seen.<br>
<br>
 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> <br>
<br>
Final Thoughts - I don't see the world the same anymore, it is impossible. While I've found how to see the beauty in my new found knowledge I don't recommend it to others. I've seen through my own eyes what reality is, how we perceive it and how it's created. I've stepped outside of Time. I've stepped out of place. I've been my own friends and had full length conversations with myself through their bodies. Ever since this experience I've had little desire to trip. I have a few times, but it's mostly taken away the desire. It is also important to remember the basic rules to tripping. SET, SETTING, DRUG, DOSE - I was in an kind of familiar place but didn't feel completely comfortable, I didn't know my buddies gf that well and she was the one who acquired the vial, she did not realize that what she had was actually 25I-NBOMe not LSD, I wish I knew how much of this I did, but two drops is hardly a reliable calculator seeing as none of them had remotely close this type of experience, they noticed barley anything except some decent visuals.<!-- End Body -->
