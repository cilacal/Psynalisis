It was one of those weeks where I just wanted to trip.<br>
<br>
I remembered my girlfriend at the time always talking about this shit she had done called 2C-E, or as they called it in my town, Europa. The way she described it to me made it very appealing. Describing things like trees uprooting themselves and walking over to a different location. So I decided I had to try it. I talked to her about where she got it, and she gave me a dealer. I bought approximately 100 mg of it. I was going to split it between myself and two friends. A and B. We had my other friend, C be our sober sitter and driver so we could go or do whatever we pleased.<br>
<br>
We measured out 20 mg for A and B and I measured out 25 for myself because I wanted to have a crazy trip. We all put the powder into orange juice and drank it. Nothing happened for a good half hour. Getting into the common tribulation of 'hey, do you think we should take more?' but we decided to stick it out.<br>
<br>
1h in: By one hour, the full effects of the body load were kicking in for me, I felt an incredible amount of energy emanating from my chest. I would compare it to the feeling after taking a shot. That sensation of warmth. My heartbeat was racing too. But I was not getting any mental effects. My friends had already fallen into their trips, and I was alone at this point. I waited another 10 minutes and then a feeling slowly encroached on me, I felt as if I was slowly starting to rush forward, and I just kept accelerating and accelerating. My thoughts, my mind, my soul was racing so fast. Incredibly fast. Then everything stopped, and I was in a new world.<br>
<br>
About 2h in: We all were laughing hysterically for a good half hour now over the way that the antenna of the van moved in the wind. I laughed so hard that I started getting a headache. A then decided that he wanted to go to the mall. It was only 8pm so we decided that it would be a great idea, and C decided that he thought we were alright to go as long as we weren't too stupid about it. We arrived at the mall, and when I got out of the van I felt fine, but once I walked through the doors into the bright mall, everything started shifting. Patterns emerged out of everything, I'd say the best way to describe it was like a persian rug. <br>
<br>
Beautiful, elaborate diamond shapes encompassed my whole spectrum of sight. They danced and I watched in awe. Then I felt a tap on my back and saw C. We went from store to store trying on hats and laughing and grinning. I'm surprised we didn't get in trouble. Our pupils were the size of grapes. As we were leaving the mall, the floor started to look like an ocean, whitecaps and everything, I heard the waves of linoleum as they crashed upon the stone walls. I felt the rubber water come up to my shins. <br>
<br>
At this point I had lost track of all time, I don't remember anything significant happening until later when A and myself decided to drive off on our own when C and B left.  <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span>  We parted ways and me and A stopped at a harbor to smoke a bowl. We talked about everything that made sense to talk about. We thought about the conscious mind. What if you hadn't been brought up to know what anything is? Would you see the same things as someone educated? these were the questions we pondered for hours. The one that stumped me was the colorblindness theory we came up with. If someone sees blue as white in their vision, they are still brought up to think that the white they see is blue, so we may all see a different color when we look at 'blue'. Who knows?<br>
<br>
The comedown happened about 8 hours in and I just went home and went to sleep. Very memorable experience.<br>
<br>
Overall, it was up there as one of the greatest bonding trips I have ever had with my friends, not quite introspective and spiritual, but a damn good time.<!-- End Body -->
