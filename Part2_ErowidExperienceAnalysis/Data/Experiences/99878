My last Trip Report submission ended with a stark warning about high-dose ingestion of nBOMe's. I should mention now that my fixation with phenethylamines as a stress relieving agent with the potential for analytic and introspective thought on life started with 2C-I, which I recently acquired more of. This wondrous therapeutic drug was missing from my life for around 2 years until last week, and even the first dose reminded me of how much potential for mental and spiritual healing this drug has; for those who've only indulged in newer phenethylamines that haven't been banned by the DEA yet, nBOMe's and various new RC's share nothing in common with classic 2C's. On to the report, though, I feel like i'm blathering to nobody.<br/>
<br/>
It was a day much unlike any other; after helping my little brother maintain his aquarium, I was threatened with a propane canister, had a metal shelf rack thrown at my head, and was punched in the nose. I'm fairly sure it's a fracture because of the immense swelling that day, and that I can still feel horrendous pain upon touching my nose, 4 days after the fact. Having recently come upon 2 grams of 2c-i, I thought that this would be a perfect time to ease my anger towards my brother; not in his violent acts but in his ego and sense of entitlement and superiority that led him to get violent after the simplest of disagreements. It was time to trip through it, and see what my subconscious could come up with.<br/>
<br/>
T+(0:00) 22 milligrams of 2C-I was carefully weighed on my milligram scale, which I calibrate every time for safety's sake. I weighed out an additional 15 mgs for my significantly smaller and less tolerant trip buddy, 'E' from my last report. We'll call him Chester, though, for easier reading. We both leaned over an air hockey table and insufflated our doses. Chester and I both noted that the typical lightning-hot 2C nose burn didn't occur until a couple minutes after the initial dosing. By the time it subsided, around 20 minutes later, our pupils were full-moon large, and we were both sufficiently blasted. From there, we sat down on some comfy chairs, drank tea, and talked about what happened that day, as well as other recent life events.<br/>
<br/>
T+(1:00) Thoughts of re-dosing occurred. Although 2C-I, in my opinion, is much safer and more agreeable than nBOMe's, I remembered my last trip report, and how I had realized at that point that a floaty ++ is much better for my mind and spirit than an overwhelmingly trippy +++ or ++++, besides the fact that these are still research chemicals, and the effects on the body are still largely undocumented. I passed up on the idea and decided to enjoy my ++ with one of my best friends. Chester, who responds to phenethylamines much better than I do, noted that he was starting to see intense Closed-Eye Visuals. This was noteworthy considering he rarely, if ever, gets visuals from hallucinogens. According to him, it's much more of a mental elasticity than it is a visual experience. I would agree with him, although the visual aspect is important to me, if only as an indicator of how safe I am in my current mindset. We got our blankets out and relaxed for a while, still just talking about life.<br/>
<br/>
T+(4:00), or somewhere close to there, was when the peak began to fade and we got on the computer to do a few things. We watched some PC Demo from Revision 2013 (trippy as always), I played some Borderlands and noted how I scared myself shitless a few trips ago after getting surrounded by particularly frightening enemies, and then set up a few more hours' worth of chill hip-hop albums. Chester and I went back to our couches, blanketed up yet again (not due to vasoconstriction, but because it was 62 degrees in the house and we were both freezing), and proceeded to have a really thoughtful conversation about why my little brother acts the way he does, and the details of his ragefit. <br/>
<br/>
For example, 'he always had an ego, but it was only bolstered by handing over control of the weed business to him. Finally he had control over something, and since then it's been impossible to teach him something, help him with something, or in any way allow him to indirectly concede that he doesn't know about something, has neglected something, or doesn't know what he's doing in regards to something. Any attempt to correct him in his infallible knowledge of the world and everything in it results in the kid going on the defensive, usually with an argument or threatening others with a knife, a can of mace, or a heavy object. Beyond that, he feels as though he's earned everything he's been given. This is a kid with a free ride through college that has never worked a day in his life. Handed a college education, handed a $1000 weed operation, handed all his contacts, handed food, water, shelter, and aid in whatever he fails to do in a timely fashion.' Chester noted that he's essentially become a product of conditioning in an environment where he was often coddled and rarely punished for misbehavior.<br/>
<br/>
I should say right now, I wouldn't have typed all that out if not for the sole purpose of highlighting the unique mindset of 2C-I. In personal experience, it allows me head space and a degree of separation from my worldly problems and my ego, giving me the rare chance to step back and view an emotionally-charged subject without emotion, without previous bias. Even with a fractured nose, I could understand why he did what he did, instead of throwing it off as him simply being unkind. I won't try and generalize by saying that everyone will experience this, but for those i've shared the experience with it seems to be a pretty common effect of 2C-I.<br/>
<br/>
T+(5:00-8:00) was fairly uninteresting. Watching visuals fade, zoning out on TV with good music playing, etc.. I won't go through all the keyboard-mashing just to make this a more arduous read.<br/>
<br/>
T+(9:00) I fell asleep on the couch with minimal effort, thoroughly exhausted from a long day and a thoughtful night.<br/>
<br/>
The main reason for writing out this report wasn't a mind-blowing ++++ spiritual journey, nor was it getting scared and panicking. This is simply written to highlight yet another wonderful experience regarding 2C-I's affinity for enabling me to analyze a situation in which i'd normally be blinded by a haze of emotion and pride. I highly suggest 2C-I if you're in a happy and stable set & setting, either simply for having a fun night with friends or to sit back and think through an event in life. All I can say is I hope others gain this mindset through 2C-I, since it's truly a useful substance and a wonderful time.<br/>
<br/>
Best regards, and remember to trip responsibly and with purpose.<!-- End Body -->
