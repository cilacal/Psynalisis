I had been planning to go to my friend’s house on the weekend for a little get together with some friends from school. All week I was trying to get my hands on some ecstasy because I had done that many times before and loved it. Instead, I ended up getting some AMT from a somewhat reliable source, because there was no ecstasy in the area. I got 4 pills, which had a very little amount of white powder in them(40-60mg), for $15 each. I was told, ‘whatever you do, don’t take two or you’ll go crazy’ and ‘don’t snort them’. So I made my trip to my friends house on Friday and had planned to wait for my other friend (we’ll call him E) to get there so we could trip at the same time, since we both had never tried amt before.  I was planning on selling the other two pills to friends of a friend but had clumsily dropped them in a puddle, which pissed me off to begin with.  <br/>
<br/>
So when E arrived, at about 12:30a.m, we were kind of in a hurry to eat them because we knew they took a while to kick in and it was already late. So after we ate them we were just chillin’ in the basement with three other friends, who were not tripping but just smoking pot. I felt a little hazy shortly after taking them, but nothing too unusual. Then about 15 minutes later I felt sick to my stomach so I asked E if he felt sick at all, and as soon as I asked him he ran to the bathroom and puked his guts out. I sat down for another half hour feeling like shit, then got up and puked my guts out. <br/>
<br/>
Not too much later (10min.), I was feeling physically exhausted and clenching my teeth like crazy (I felt like I was rolling, but not as happy), but the only visuals so far were tracers and exaggerated lighting. It was not until around 2 a.m. or so until the visuals got amazing and my senses seemed to all be heightened. The touch of anything to my body felt great, and little figurines came to life. I got confused a lot at whether I was supposed to sit down and watch t.v., or explore. I stood up every so often to examine the floor as it danced and swirled. <br/>
<br/>
I felt like I was seeing the earth move under the carpet. This drug was strong enough to make me not even want to smoke pot! I felt no need to, even though I was physically capable of it. It was not until about 6a.m (everyone else was sleeping) when E and I finally decided to take some bong rips. Then we sat down and started watching cartoons, but I was analyzing them like had never done before. This is when everything turned bad. I started relating every message of the cartoon to my life. I would think a thought and if something good would happen on the show, I would think ‘yeah I’m supposed to be thinking that’. Or when something would happen on the cartoon I would think it was directed directly at me, and only me (which reminds me of the time I tripped on mescaline and I got the same effects, only the environment was different so it fueled more positive thoughts). I felt like everyone else in the world were just actors and they were only here to convince me that it was real. So I said to E ‘I’m starting to get some pretty weird thoughts’, but I couldn’t explain them. I didn’t know if I had just discovered the key to death and I had obtained a message somehow that I was on my way (to the afterlife), or if I was just going crazy.  <br/>
<br/>
I was so confused at this point and I wanted out of the situation. I went upstairs and tried to leave through the side door, but when I tried to open it the alarm went off and his dad came out. I apologized and went back downstairs. At this point I told E what happened and felt like I really needed to leave then. So I went back upstairs and went out the door this time, only to see his dad outside with the dog. I said ‘I gotta go’ and he said ‘have a good rest of the summer’. (I must have looked like a basketcase). But anyways, I got in my car and was trying to find my way out of the neighborhood, which was unfamiliar to me. <br/>
<br/>
 <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> <br/>
At this point I was still hallucinating, but not nearly as much as 3 hours before. I drove around in circles for about 10 minutes and then finally found my way out to the highway. I don’t remember exactly what I was thinking at the time, but I know I wanted to die, or rather I thought I was supposed to die…like it was planned out that I was supposed to wreck my mom’s 97 Honda civic into a middle highway barrier across two lanes of traffic. So that’s exactly what I did. But as soon as I saw the smoke I yelled in anger because I was still alive, or rather because I now knew I was alive, or maybe because I did not have an easy death. I don’t know. <br/>
<br/>
But I got out of the car, and walked across the highway only to see a man stopped along the road (who happened to be an off- duty police officer).  I talked to him as he was on the passenger side of his car and got in the open door of his driver’s side. I was having a heated discussion with him and tried to start the car to drive off, but there were no keys in the ignition. So I got out and ran down the road trying to hitch hike my way home before the cops got there, and miserably failed. It was not too long before I was tackled, cuffed, and thrown in the back of a cop car.  But the stupid cops left the door open while they were talking to me. I remember yelling at them and them saying to me ‘how would you like to get your ass beat by two of the smallest cops in town?’ <br/>
<br/>
The drug was fueling my anger completely. This pissed me off so much that I got out of the car and ran down the street against oncoming traffic, yelling ‘go ahead and kill me muther fuckers’, all while being chased by these two cops. Then, once they caught me (I am a pretty fast cat) they tackled me again and threw me in the back of another cop car (but this time they shut the door). Then while they were talking to me through the window, trying to see if I should go to the hospital or jail, I started realizing what was happening, and I thought I was in hell. I thought I had died and I was in hell, or almost there. Then they put me on a stretcher and were tying me down and putting something on my face (oxygen maybe). <br/>
<br/>
I thought they were wrapping me like a mummy and they were going to bury me without telling anybody. At that point I thought I was alive, but they were going to kill me. I remember resisting the wrapping by kicking (even though I was restrained. They later told me that I was biting and spitting and that it took 7 of them to hold me down, which is hard to believe because I am a small guy). I remember being put into an ambulance, but after that it gets foggy. I then woke up in a restraining bed in the Hospital. There were cops all around and I would not go to sleep because I was afraid I would wake up in jail. I spent all day in the hospital and sobered up eventually. Keep in mind that I am a normally laid-back, easy going guy, and would never in my wildest dreams even think about committing suicide, resisting arrest, stealing a car, or anything like that if I was sober. I don’t like to blame all of this on the drug. It is partly my fault because of the environment I chose to expand my mind in.<!-- End Body -->
