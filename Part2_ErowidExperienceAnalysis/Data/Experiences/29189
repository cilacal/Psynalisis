Well the night started out fine at around 6:30pm me and my two friends smoked about five bowls and were hanging out. We then decided to give the good ol' dealer a call and see what he had. He came over with three vials of AMT. I looked AMT up on the net and it described to me something that sounded pretty damn fun. But, I was very sketchy about the whole situation because well i'm a sketchy person. So, I decided not to take it and just 'baby-sit' my two friends. <BR>
<BR>
They took the vials at around 8:30pm and being very skeptical they thoguht it wouldn't work. So at around 9pm they both started complaning about a stomache ache and harsh nausea, they took three tums. My friend 'Sally' went to the bathroom to puke, she was in there about 10mins and puked beyond belief. While 'Sally' was in the bathroom, 'Jan's' trip began disoriented behavior, her body was numb and tingly. <BR>
<BR>
'Sally' came out of the bathroom and her and I agreed that smoking would make us feel better so...we all went downstairs to smoke some more. 'Sally' was not feeling anything and felt that she should take my vial...I said just to take half because it still could possibly be in your system. So as 'Sally' and I were smoking a couple of bowls, 'Jan' was tripping hard, vivid colors, mild haulcinations,twitching feet, couldn't feel her body...*But the entire time she still felt nauseated*...<BR>
<BR>
We went upstairs again it was about 10pm, time seemed to be going so slow. 'Jan' could barley walk, she layed down on the bed and just stared into space. 'Sally' went and took another vial (I told her to only take 1/2)...It was 10:30pm and both of the girls were laying down on the bed complaning about their stomaches and head's hurting. 'Sally' said she felt like she needed to have excessive bowel movements, but she couldn't go. They both had the worst gas also. They kept on saying 'ALL I WANT TO DO IS SLEEP!!'<BR>
<BR>
The time was 11:30...The whining and complaning didn't stop, both of them were taking trips to the bathroom laying over the toilet because they felt so bad and they just wanted to puke...They were seeing faces in the air and patterns in the curtains still...It was 12am, 'Jan' was complaining about how bad her head hurt and she just needed to throw up but couldn't, she said if felt like knives were coming into her head. 'Sally' was on the bed curled up in a ball holding her stomache. Finally, I gave them some dramamine at 12:30am, they just layed in the bed and held their stomaches 'Ahhhh, I feel so bad, I want to die, I feel so nauseated'...They had been drinking water the whole night by the way, and before they ate a bit...I gave them one dramamine each to try and wave the nausea and with that they seemed to calm down and pass out at about 1:30am. <BR>
<BR>
The next morning (Right now) they seem to be 'normal' again...'Sally's' jaw hurts because of her grinding her teeth and 'Jan' feels exhausted and out of it and both of their heads hurt a lot. <BR>
<BR>
I hope you all just don't think 'Oh,that was just a bad batch'  because it wasn't...It was the worst pain my two friends have been in, and I hope you all think twice before doing this stuff. It's a big deal...Just stick to the shit you have done before and know about...<!-- End Body -->
