<!-- Start Body -->
I've been playing with jwh-018 for about a week and a half. The '18' is 99.9% pure in powder form. I've been playing around with the dosing trying to figure out my tolerance. I started the dosing very slowly spanning a few days. Last night, I decided that my '18' voyage didn't go far enough into the cosmos so I smoked and ingested around 30-40mg. I smoked more than I consumed. I don't have a mg scale so I eyeballed it referencing my previous trials. Again like before, tolerance with mild effect. This point was around the hour and half mark. <br/>
<br/>
Around the two hour mark me and my girlfriend got some Chinese food. This was the biggest mistake ever. I had chicken and broccoli (brown sauce) and white rice. Also scarfed down a few pork dumplings. The food was good quality, safe, never had a bad meal from the restaurant. 20 minutes after eating I fell into a void, a place where no one should ever go. I felt like something went really wrong because even at my highest point in the past I never felt this high. My brain dissolved into a nose dive towards an abyss where time felt forever and space was a place of uncertainty. The universe was a closet which we were born into without ever getting to see the outside world...<br/>
<br/>
It was the rice or something in the Chinese food that amplified the effects of '18'. Why I say this is because the same effect happened to me more mildly a few days prior when I ate rice after smoking '18'. This time it was unexpectedly profound...<br/>
<br/>
Going back to the nightmare, I excused myself after the 20min launch. I went to the bedroom with water in hand and I laid down. It was 10:30pm. I was slipping, falling deeper into the rabbit hole. I really thought that my brain was going to shut down, I was so so so so so so fucking high that my soul felt like it was on its way out of my body. I reassured myself that this would pass while making the usual mental promises of never doing this again, please let me live, I'm so stupid, I don't want to die before my time... yadda yadda. <br/>
<br/>
10:35pm and all I want is to get off this ride. So scared... don't want to go farther. But of course, I went farther. All I could do was try to calm down and drink water hoping to flush the chemical out of my body. I drank as much water as possible. I urinated twice within 20 minutes. With each came a 5% reduction. <br/>
<br/>
10:40pm I want to destroy the clock next to the bed. It gave me false hope in thinking that it would end. Every moment was an eternity, every passing minute was a lifetime. I can't close my eyes without feeling the toll of '18'. It held me and wouldn't let go. I couldn't stop rotating my feet, I would look around the room, stare outside the window, stare at the clock, stare at the temp reading on the A.C. The outside world was so foreign, it was a place where I had a feeling of purgatory. <br/>
<br/>
10:50 Enough is enough... my brain is melting. 10:55pm Heart rate and pulse way to high. My chest is going to explode. 11:00pm more water, trying to take my mind off of heart beats. I focused on breathing calmly. 11:10 I'm hoping my girlfriend doesn't come to bed cause I can't stop moving around. I didn't want her to know that I was over the edge with '18'. Didn't want to go to hospital or anything like that. Somewhere I knew I was going to make it. 11:30... The meltdown continued... overall, the feeling of what I was going through was similar to having your body teleported like in Star Trek but not materializing on the other end. 11:35 last time I looked at the clock. I was finally able to fall asleep... really glad. <br/>
<br/>
In the morning, I woke up 6:45am ready to go to work. Everything was surreal, like I was in someone else's body. I got into my car and drove to work. I didn't have any coordination problems. I'm still spacey after 12 hours from the trip. My mind feels like Swiss Cheese. I'm not having difficulty integrating or maintaining thought; however, I'm feeling a little bit of psychosis. 15% percent of my perception of reality is 'out of touch'. The world feels fake and my appreciation for life is greater after almost losing my soul. <br/>
<br/>
My advice... Be Very Very careful. I'm not a novice and I don't shy away from a spiritual journey but '18' is a serpentine hellbent on making you its bitch. You don't have to dose high to get wasted. Try a little with rice or some other carbohydrate. <br/>
<br/>
Respect it and it will respect you.<br/>
