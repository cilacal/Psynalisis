<br>
This compound is nothing short of remarkable, and it is completely understandable why it is one of Shulgin's 'Magical Half Dozen', and is the last legal one. I find this compound helped me and others dramatically with art. I am an engineering student, and I normally have no interest in art, but found myself able to use the right side of my brain almost entirely. I have, since this trip, grown to appreciate art. It was beautiful in that regard. I often remark that it is an 'Artist's Adderall.' Shulgin said that this compound has a 'seemingly infinite number of uses' and I completely agree with that.<br>
<br>
The first time I took this compound, I explored the 5 senses through it. I found that my tactile, oral, and visual senses were enhanced, while smelling and hearing things remained relatively normal. My appetite was mildly affected, but I was still able to eat a few scoops of ice cream and drink 16oz of lemonade without much difficulty.<br>
<br>
Visually, I was seeing sinusoidal patterns in the sidewalks as I walked, and the streets became more vividly defined with colors (they had a cold steel color to them, and some pretty interesting shading). Tracers were abound on this compound, and with color enhancement. There was no morphing or warping or breathing of textures I found, unlike 2C-E. I felt extremely creative, and could see many things. This is when I realized that it has many uses for artists, and when I knew I would have to explore the compound artistically. <br>
<br>
I would see fractals in the paper, and I could see where it was thick and where it was thin when I was drawing on it, and I was drawing to these curves. I would then draw, and my hand would flow freely, and so I listened to music as I drew. I would feel the music, and would draw to its beats. I found that I enjoyed longer, slower, songs, and in a sense, found this to highly effectively my ADD. I drew for 5.5 hours straight, and ended up making a really good work of art, all things considered. It made me an artist.<br>
<br>
Tactile senses are not to be overlooked, either. I found many textures to be soft, or smooth, and my tactile senses overall were very enhanced, but remained relatively normal. It shared MDMA's property, in this regard, where some of the things that it was acting on in my brain, MDMA also acted on; particularly the stuff that makes textures feel much more vivid and amazing. I could not help but be sensitive to temperature changes, and I constantly felt cold, which was partially because 2C's act as vasoconstrictors, so my extremeities received a bit less blood flow and felt a bit cold. I also sweated a lot, which made transitioning from cold buildings to warm outsides...interesting. This is part of the reason why it is labeled as entactogenic.<br>
<br>
Auditorially, things remained relatively normal. I mean, if cannabis makes music a +++, this stuff maybe made music sound a bit more interesting that normal, at a + to ++. I noticed that I preferred long, slow songs. In particular, I loved Rush's '2112', Fuck Buttons' 'Tarot Sport' album, and I also enjoyed Explosion's In The Sky in general, because the songs flow together rather smoothly and they are long (so I wouldn't have to mess with my music player).<br>
<br>
Mentally, I found this compound to be relatively clear-headed. Conversation flow was normal, and I could comprehend thoughts, and I felt an enhancement of empathy (though nowhere near what MDMA does for empathy). Creativity definitely is enhanced under the influence of this compound, as well. Ideas and thoughts flow freely, and things that one would normally be reserved about, one would find himself less reserved (though, again, MDMA does this part better as well). I do feel at peace with myself under this compound, and it does have the entactogenic property to it. If I were to take this with a close, or significant other, it would be a bonding experience for the both of us.<br>
<br>
Physically, I felt a bit nauseous at about 90 to 120 minutes after dosing. I could not avoid purging, and my nose ran a bit afterwards (and I will say that slightly acidic mucus in the nasal passages does not feel good while tripping). However, aside from the nausea, there is the typical, and classical, phenethylamine body buzz. It was about what the body buzz of 2C-E's was, but possibly a bit less; it certainly wasn't as heavy as DMT's or 6-APB's. I felt a bit sensitive to temperature changes, and when it was 25 degrees celsius outside, and a gust of wind blew, I felt a bit cold - albeit refreshed. My heart rate had also increased, as is common with phenethylamines.<br>
<br>
Other things I noticed:<br>
<br>
CNS Stimulant (Accelerated Heart Rate, Increase in blood pressure, Increased Stamina)<br>
Mydriasis (Pupil Dilation) <br>
Vasoconstrictor (constricts blood vessels; caffeine or OTC pain-relievers can counteract this if it grows problematic)<br>
Bruxism (Grinding of teeth)<br>
<br>
Euphoria present (though nowhere near MDMA; also euphoria is not guaranteed)<br>
Time dilation<br>
Visual enhancement (contrast and colors are enhanced, though they never change; things don't warp or breathe, either).<br>
Entactogenic<br>
Mildly empathogenic<br>
<br>
Overall commentary:<br>
<br>
I love this compound. One of my favorite compounds of all time. The first time I dosed it, I decided to explore the 5 senses to see which ones it was the most reactive to. After discovering that it had great potential for art and visual things, as well as enhancing creativity, I decided that this is probably a compound meant for art, and proceeded to explore it that way the 2nd time I dosed. When I did this, I drew a picture for 5.5 hours, and when it was done, I was not only proud of it, but it was also the best work of art I had ever done. I am not an artist, but this compound made me one. The picture was called 'Naturalis/Aritificalis', and was a take on the left and right sides of the brain, and each half of the picture represented a side of the brain. I drew things very detailed, and even started going down to the fibonacci number sequence for drawing vines and leaves and brances and stems. The amount of focus and creativity that flowed through me was alien to me, and I feel changed throughout the whole experience.<br>
<br>
<br>
Medically, this compound shows some importance:<br>
First of all, in regards to the DEA's scheduling system, this would be seen as Schedule I because they will claim it has no medical uses (and they won't look for them) and it has a 'high potential for abuse' (even though I have no physical or mental desires to take the compound again; I don't have any reservations for taking it either, though). There is no physical desire from me to take it again, and the nausea I remember from the oral doses keeps any mental desire far away. However, here's what I think it would be useful for, medically.<br>
<br>
Depression - While it does not induce euphoria, it helps catalyze euphoric feelings. In combination with weed, it would certainly be highly beneficial.<br>
ADD/ADHD - I had never felt as focused as I did when I was on this, coloring. Never before had I ever colored for 5.5 hours.<br>
Narcolepsy - This substance is a CNS stimulant, but also doesn't kill appetite, and thus is useful for me. Nausea is the only downside, so I take it on an empty stomach so I don't lose food.<br>
Couple's Therapy - This compound has worked well for me in this regard.<br>
<br>
Cessation of smoking - This is something I did not expect. I am not sure if it was the DMT I had smoked the day before first trying this compound, or if it was the compound itself, but I haven't smoked nearly as much as I used to. I found that while I was coming up on this compound, I was craving a cigarette; after I purged, I no longer craved one and forgot all about the fact that I was a smoker. While tripping, I tried smoking a cigarette, but ultimately got bored with it, consciously felt and acknowledged that I had no need to keep smoking, and then puffed on the cigarette like a cigar rather than inhaling it. I then put the cigarette out in some spit, and drew with it on the roof (which is when I found out that this compound has significant art potential).<br>
<br>
I haven't smoked more than maybe a total of 3 cigarettes since I tripped. I have severely slowed down my smoking, if not stopped it all together. I feel no physical cravings, and few mental cravings. I might have found a cure for smoking.<br>
<br>
Closing commentary:<br>
<br>
From helping me quit smoking to bringing out the latent, inner-artist inside of me, I learned a lot through this compound. I am sure it has many, MANY more uses, and I would love to find all of those - especially before it goes illegal. Shulgin was definitely right when he said that this compound has 'seemingly infinite uses.' This compound is good for at least artists, smokers, and those seeking creativity and inspiration. I am sure there are plenty more uses for it out there, waiting to be explored. While the compound is not necessarily strictly medical, I feel it should be available to the general public in carefully measured doses.<!-- End Body -->
