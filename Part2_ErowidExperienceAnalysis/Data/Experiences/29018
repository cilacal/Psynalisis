I had tried to get drunk before the previous year on New Year's Eve by drinking wine but nothing happened. The next year I was determined to get drunk as hell. I had to know what it was like.<BR>
<BR>
So I got a 375ml bottle of 40% Vodka (well my mother did, I was 16 at the time) and set myself to drinking it. I sat down and started playing some video games, sipping the vodka while I played. My mother suggested mixing it with orange juice but I just wanted to drink it straight. The taste was pretty horrible, but not as bad as the some of the beer I had tasted previously. Little did I know that the taste and even smell of vodka would make me nauseous afterwards.<BR>
<BR>
I got up from the couch and noticed there was a lag in my vision, like my brain wasn't acting fast enough for my eyes. I walked slowly to the kitchen and my mother asked me how I felt. 'Fine', I said. I started to laugh at nothing and thought this must've been what beind drunk was like.<BR>
<BR>
It was all downhill from there.<BR>
<BR>
I went back to the living room and started feeling nauseous. I closed my eyes and lay down on the couch. Supper was ready so my mother brought it in. Pizza. I didn't want to open my eyes because the room was spinning so I decided to eat with my eyes closed.<BR>
<BR>
After having a few bites of the homemade pizza, I felt like puking so I stumbled to the bathroom sat down next to the toilet. My eyes were still closed when I vomitted up the pizza and had to lay my head down on the toilet because of the nausea. I stayed in that position for probably 20 minutes before deciding to go back to the living room. I got on all fours and crawled down the hall. It's about 10 feet from bathroom to living room. At the entrance I started puking again and couldn't move anymore. My mother got me a pillow and I lay on the floor. With my head on the pillow I began retching because my stomach was empty. At this point (8pm) I passed out and woke up at 3am. I lay on the floor for 10 minutes trying to get up so I could brush my teeth and change.<BR>
<BR>
I finally got up slowly and carefully walked to the bathroom and then up the stairs to my bed.<BR>
<BR>
The next morning I woke up to an extremely sore throat and my heart beating like I had just sprinted somewhere. I felt extrememly dehydridated and asked my mom for a glass of juice. I sat up in bed and drank it slowly. I threw it up 5 minutes later into the can next to my bed.<BR>
<BR>
For four days afterwards I had extremely painful headaches (I never, ever have headaches) and a very sore throat. I swore to myself that I would never get drunk again. I'm a teenager so of course I broke my promise but I've yet to even touch any kind of hard alcohol. The vodka bottle is still in my kitchen cupboard and just looking at it now makes me feel sick.<!-- End Body -->
