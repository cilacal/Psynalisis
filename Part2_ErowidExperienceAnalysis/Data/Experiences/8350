I only took the drug because my friend said he saw so many pretty colors, i wanted to see what he saw. there was about 6 of us who tried it. we all took 25mg. it seemed as if it was not going to work. almost two hours after taking it the colors and crazy images slowly started to appear, while i was inside for a long time i felt uncomfortable. i could not look at any of my friends because their faces were distorted (ugly). eventually i went outside. it was raining very hard but it didnt bother me, the grass looked like the ocean the way it was moving. the ground i could hardly walk it was moving so fast and carzy. i found one of my friends. he wasnt having a very good time. we walked around outside suddenly i looked down and saw that i was stepping on these green worm like things that fall off of trees when it rains, but the half i was not stepping on was wiggiling and looking up at me with big eyes and the rest of them were crawling all around. it scared the shit out of me i screamed and jumped off the sidewalk. this was the most intense trip i have ever had. its not anything like acid. nothing in the world can compare to it. i could not look at any thing and it not move. i can eat acid like water, but there was a point where i cried and wished it was over. my friends re-assured me it was just a drug and it would go away soon. i got better and after that i enjoyed my self. <BR>
<BR>
they were wrong about it going away soon. this trip lasted 18 straight long hours. it was like i was stuck in peak forever, it was like alice in wonderland 25 times worse. I would probably have to eat a whole vial of acid to come close. <BR>
<BR>
i suggest that any one who tries this do not take more than 25mg so you do not get sick, and make sure that you are around people who can help you in case you wig out. its very very intense so be careful. its almost unexplainable. make sure you have all day because it lasts all day.<!-- End Body -->
