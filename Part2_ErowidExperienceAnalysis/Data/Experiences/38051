Saturday night, sitting around a table at another friends house, rolling some joints for a ride down the key to get ripped up, sitting at the table, I took out the capsule, I had no idea what effects to expect, maybe something like LSD, but different, honestly I thought I had been ripped off, and whatever was in the capsule was not a hallucinogenic chemical, I took half the capsule off for a quicker onset, and i swallowed down the pill, washed it down with a gulp of Coke. It was only 15minutes later, still sitting where I ate it when I felt something. I felt high, I had been smoking cannabis, but it was something else, I looked straight up at the ceiling, and noticed movement, like the beginning of a LSD trip. We were gonna go for a ride, and burn a J or 2, so I got in the backseat of a friends truck, and we were off.<BR>
<BR>
I was on a emotional roller coaster ride, I had never done MDMA, but I was feeling a really strong roll, as if all my serotonin was free flowing, damn it felt good, my skin , and lip felt weird, almost like damp clay, reminded me of my acid experience, visuals were dizzy, riding in a truck with music on I felt riding through eternity, music never hit me that hard, after a few puffs of the J, and I was gone, the inside of the truck, and people in it were distorting in very odd dimentions, lights were intense, everything was very intense, it was a delerium feeling of a amphetamine high of strong euphoria with dream-like visuals, we were doing donuts in a parking lot, and it was fucking insane just being in that truck. We came back to the house to watch a movie, the movie went on for an hour or two, everyone else was stoned, and looked tired, I was speeding, almost speeding ahead of present time. (what the fucK? I thought, this all feels like it already happened) I expected a friend to speak any second, and I heard words come out of his mouth that sounded like what I expected him to say.Suddenly I outburst paranoid, and freaking out.. 'This already happened... Do you guys see this? What we are doing, everything, even what I am saying, I can see it already happened, and I am watching it again' No one in the room felt the same way, and they could tell by now I was tripping into insanity. I have never takin a drug which made me have dejavu for like 5-10minutes straight, foreseeing everything a good 10 seconds before it took place, it was something out of Donnie Darco is what I would compare it to. The movie ended, everyone got up, half passed out from the weed, and went home, I said I was going to go home as well, so I went outside.<BR>
<BR>
Paranoia of the night world came into play, it was probally because I was outside, alone, and tripping in darkness, at the time this was the highest high I had ever had, I only made it less than 100ft from the house when the trees felt like they were falling onto me, and I felt so overwhelmed that I would not make it home, but rather blackout, and wake up in some strange neighborhood in somones lawn. I ran back to the house, and told my friend I was in no condition of walking home, and he told me to just spend the night, everyone in the house was asleep, except myself, I was wide awake as hour by hour went by, I felt no time, and afterawhile this feeling got very old, and repetitive, I tried sleeping, sleep wouldn't come, I looked for something fun to do, but it was just blah feeling, at one part of the night I compared the effects to something mescaline would have felt like, but I doubt mescaline would feel this synthetic, and meaningless. I looked for messages, and visions, all I saw was pattering, the doorframes got smaller, and larger, looked similar to the behavior of the lines in that movie waking life (very similar), I didn't go home, and goto bed until 9am. It was indeed a weird night.<!-- End Body -->
