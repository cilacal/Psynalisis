<!-- Start Body -->
I am a late 20's male. 155lbs. Experienced with a wide array of drugs but have been relatively sober the last few years (Mephedrone/4-MEC once or twice a year, Alcohol once a week, Marijuana once a week, Ritalin 10mg (prescribed and not abused). My crazier days were in my late teens and early twenties when I used a variety of substances regularly. This was my first *real* time trying 2C-B. <br>
<br>
This was the first psychedelic experience I had since 2008 when I ate 2 grams of Mushrooms so I was thoroughly looking forward to it. I was looking forward to 2C-B especially because I vividly remember reading about it for the first time when I was 18 online. The reports I read made it out to be a fantastic drug. <br>
<br>
I took the 18mg Blue Bee pills that were going around last summer and were tested and confirmed to have 18mg (maybe 19mg I forget). I bought two of them at the time and saved them. I took one for my first time this past fall... however I was quite drunk at the time and was using Mephedrone (high dose). The combination of the three substances led to a instant blackout and I remember nothing at all of the experience. I woke up in my bed the next morning, my fiancee told me it looked like I was having a blast, but I have zero recollection of anything at all that happened to me. So this in a nutshell was essentially my first time with the drug.<br>
<br>
Setting: Red Rocks Colorado, STS9 concert. Hard to find a better environment to trip. No substances in my body other than a bit of caffeine. <br>
<br>
I took the pill 30 minutes before the set starts. The come up is FOREVER. I still was never really was sure when I finally came up. The first hour and a half felt like a mushroom come up, filled with anxiety and nausea that a mushroom come up brings however it never subsided like mushrooms do. My legs were getting shaky, my mind was getting anxious, and my stomach was aching. I was not sure if I had to use the bathroom or if it was just in my imagination.<br>
<br>
I left the venue to use the bathroom. I had pretty bad GI problems. I made sure to stay hydrated the entire time. Throughout this endless come up, which consisted of little to no visuals, I had to leave the concert on three separate occasions to use the bathroom.<br>
<br>
My thoughts were jumbled. I was 'pseudo tripping'. My mind was in a weird semi-psychedelic mind state where I mentally felt 90% sober and 10% tripping. When I was in that 10% psychedelic head space I could never could really hold on to a thought and the thoughts I was thinking of were pretty uninteresting compared to Mushrooms, LSD, and 2C-E. It was 2 hours after taking the pill and I still felt like I was coming up. <br>
<br>
After close to two hours of anxiousness, very mild visuals, and stomach discomfort, I decided I really was not having a good time and bought a beer to help with the anxiety. After drinking it it made things a bit more blurry and it made me have a few more visuals. It also made my body pretty warm for better or for worse. I finished 75% of the beer and tried to enjoy the rest of the show. The whole time I STILL felt like I was in a mushroom comeup which never came. Slowly as the set ended the come up subsided and I began to sober up.<br>
<br>
I got back to the car, and drank a Red Bull to stay awake. My sober friend, who I was with and had a great time at the show drove me back. <br>
<br>
Twenty minutes later (around 3.5 hours after taking the pill) I was totally sober but my brain was a little drained. I went to a bar and drank a few glasses of straight Jack Daniels, merely wanting to quell the anxiety and forget the 'trip' if you call it that even happened. I went to my friends place and tried to sleep. No luck. I took 20mg of Valium to help get to sleep but still no luck. It was not until a friend arrived late at night with a few more beers that I was finally able to pass out.<br>
<br>
The next day there was no hangover from the 2C-B. I was pretty tired, but I am positive it was from the 20mg Valium and the 4 or 5 drinks I had at the end of the night. <br>
<br>
What I was expecting:<br>
A short trip with nice visuals and a good body high<br>
<br>
What I got:<br>
A never ending come up. No peak. Confusion. Paranoia. Anxiety.<br>
<br>
All in all 2C-B is a pretty awful drug and I will never be trying this again. Whenever I trip again, which I imagine will be in years from now seeing as I will probably be starting a family sometime soon I will stick to LSD or Mescaline if I can get my hands on it. <br>
<br>
To this date I have tried three 2C drugs. 2C-B, 2C-D, and 2C-E. The only one of those three I enjoyed was 2C-E at 18-20mg. 2C-B and 2C-D are worthless compounds in my opinion.<br>
<br>
Since 2C-B generally gets rave reviews, it just goes to show that everyone reacts different to drugs.<!-- End Body -->
