Not too long ago I suggested to a few friends of mine that we bike 45 miles out of my state.  Of course by me proposing this venture it is assumed that some sort of psychedelic be consumed.  This conversation took place the day before my friends and I actually biked out of state on August 31, 2011.  For me, I decided to insufflate 2mg of 25i-nBOME, far different from my buddies dosing 2C-E and mushrooms.  At this point I am on probation and sticking only to legal/not tested for substances such as booze, psychedelics, and legal smoke.<br>
	<br>
Prior to this date I had only tried 25i once before and loved it, but because I was at a ridiculous show I can’t quite recall what happened to me.  This was my first and only experience as of yet to have a clear meaning.  I got really pumped up for this because I love biking large distances and tripping.<br>
<br>
We started off the day at around three or four in the afternoon and started the bike ride out of state.  About ten minutes in we found a good spot to appropriately ingest our drugs.  I quickly snorted my pre-weighed cap of 25i-nBOME.  We got back on our bikes and continued to bike around.  By the time we stopped to grab a swig of water I was noticing a change in how I felt.  <br>
<br>
The come-up felt like the energy flowing through my body similar to that of LSD.  This was mixed with the stimmy euphoria of 2C-I as well as the uneasiness produced from 2C-E.  After this the come-up became unclear because biking mile on end seemed to distract me.  By the next time we stopped I was tripping hard.  The environment seemed to move just like acid with typical patterns and hysterical laughter over silly ideas.  My friends had decided to smoke a blunt so I packed up a bubbler with some legal smoke.  After smoking I felt very little different from before, despite smoking a blend I find stronger than weed itself.  My emotions from this point on continued to escalate from a tripping state of mind almost to a rolling state of mind.<br>
	<br>
Everything I thought of, every breeze that blew by, and every word uttered filled me with tingling sensations and a very natural sense of joy.  It was one of the most amazing feelings to be biking freely about just soaking up the sights and bumping into the occasional traveler.  About two hours in I realized that I was intensely focused on how I felt, almost to the point that I was not paying attention to real life at all.  I “looked up” and saw myself spiraling down an endless hill at what seemed to be a million hours an hour.  The trail I was on was actually extremely flat the whole way.<br>
	<br>
We had finally reached the state line at this point and decided to rest.  Out of nowhere an elderly man approached us and said “Can I ask you folks a favor, cause I don’t wanna see you dead?  Above you is ‘that’ hanging by a string.  I’ve been telling authorities to get rid of it, but they still haven’t.  If you hear a crack, run like hell.”  We all looked up and there was literally nothing hanging above us. Encountering this man really changed my trip for me.  I was not disturbed by him, only permanently puzzled.<br>
	<br>
For the rest of the trip the visuals totally absorbed my consciousness.  Every moment would be “Oh my god!  Why are there some many people roaming the woods?”  or “SHIT, the ground is splitting open!”.  The path would seem to wind away into the sky or my friends would seem to be sucked into the ground.  Everything including the trees, bushes, sky, and water would melt together to create one single image.   <br>
	<br>
I could go on telling many stories about all the visuals for the rest of the bike ride, but it did not seem to vary that much.  Nothing changed until my friends and I had biked back into town.  It was closer to 10pm and things got a WHOLE lot more funky.  Almost every shadow I saw would turn into the image of a human, and artificial source of light would look like an eye.  I started hearing people talk to me, feeling animals perch on my shoulder.  Basically I just started hallucinating a bunch of things for no reason at all. On top of the all the tripping, my behavior seemed almost exactly like acid.  Communicating with people became the most awkward thing.  I would consistently say awkward things and have extreme difficulty communicating.  Other than that, there was very little mental aspect to the drug.<br>
	<br>
In conclusion, this is one of my favorite psychedelics.  I don’t think there is very much to be learned from this chemical in comparison to many other psychedelics, but the magic seems to lay in the feeling that no bad trip can occur.  Despite feeling and seeing things that would normally frighten or worry me, I did not care.  The euphoria produced from it seems to reduce all anxiety for me. I like it more than LSD, the reason being because I visualize more and don’t scrutinize every little detail in my head.<br>
	<br>
Long story short, 25i-nBOME is an amazing party psychedelic mainly due to the intense euphoria and lack of worry, while the few mental alterations makes it less worthy to produce an insightful experience.<!-- End Body -->
