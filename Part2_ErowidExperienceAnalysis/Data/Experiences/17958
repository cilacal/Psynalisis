Last night was the worst night of my life. I learned what the bottom feels like. It all started by attending a local house party on a friday night with my friend M. We drank a couple beers, the cops showed up, and everyone left. M's parents were gone for the weekend, and we had money for more beer, so we gathered up a few (5) people to return to her house. There was a bit more beer drinking, though I quit after my third at the party and was losing the buzz quite quickly. M decided to eat some of the remnants of our dried 5-MeO-DiPT (Foxy) solution that was left in the vial, and she quickly realized the dose was larger than expected, so she asked me to take care of her.<BR>
<BR>
Now, M is, or was last night, my best friend in the world. She and I were as close as you can be without, well, dating I suppose. I care about her more than anyone else, and of course I was more than willing to help her through what might be a difficult trip. M and I are experienced drug users, with many previous foxy trips under our belts, several of them with each other. I knew, to an extent, what to expect from it. Though it may not have been the best thing to do, I usually think that in this type of situation taking a small amount of whatever substance the tripper I'm sitting for is in order, just so I can understand their headspace better. Henceforth, down went what I assumed to be a small dose of foxy methoxy.<BR>
<BR>
After a few minutes I realized I was actually going to have a regulation-strength trip. No matter, as I am almost always good about retaining my wits, not to mention the presence of a few other experienced hallucinogen users. Things went from bad to worse, and it turns out that somehow M never really tripped that hard. I somehow got a much larger dose than her, and embarked on the most horrific trip of my life.<BR>
<BR>
I've had scary trips before. I've been paranoid, I've been sad, I've been restless, etc. etc. etc. I can deal with these things, and typically view even those kinds of trips as 'good'. This was different, though. I simply lost my sanity. I was shaking, twitching, and vomiting intermittently in the back yard. My reality had hit a brick wall at 60mph, and I wasn't wearing my seatbelt.<BR>
<BR>
For background's sake, when M and I first started hanging out about a year ago, I was quite in love with her. She seemed interested at first, but it waned. Of course, my feelings didn't. After about 8 months of pursuing her, I realized that my feelings for her were interfering with me being a good friend, so I spent several weeks literally talking myself out of having a romantic attraction to her. Effectively, it worked, because I no longer chase after her, but when a person loves someone as much as I loved M, there will always be some residual feelings. I have a bit of an inferiority complex going, I think, because every time M shows interest in someone, the thought runs through my head: 'I'm not as good as him.'<BR>
<BR>
M knows all this. And she has been in the hole I was in, that bottomless pit of insanity that a truly bad trip can be. I expected her to do the same thing I would have done for her, just be there. Alas, I was sitting on M's bed with her and an aquaintance of mine named J. J had decided to come on a whim, and had never met M before. One thing led to another, and while I was sitting on the bed, M and J started kissing rather intimiately. After a few seconds, I had the sense enough to leave the room. I soon realized that they would not be following me. I spent the rest of the night alone in M's living room, desperately clutching the furniture around me, alternating between trying to convince myself I wasn't going to die and praying with all my soul that I would. I was shaking uncontrollalby, breathing like I was having an asthma attack, and crying. M knew all this, and I believe she must have known that I needed her more than anything then, more than I've ever needed anyone. But she had to get laid. So, as I was far too gone to drive myself anywhere (as if I had somewhere to go), I sat in M's living room for 6 hours listening to the noises in the next room, feeling far lower than I knew you could feel. I think the combination of foxy and alcohol is somewhat toxic, as I was having severe muscle spasms, tachychardia, etc.<BR>
<BR>
I've never actually wanted to die before. No matter how low I got, I always clung to some thread of hope. But the abandonment and rejection I felt was unrivaled even in the most sadistic corners of my imagination. Now, when the best friend I've ever had can stab me so deeply, I question whether there are really people out there that love others as much as I love.<BR>
<BR>
I apologize for the lack of an extensive biography in this report, but it was intended to be a lesson in set, setting, and responsible dosing.<BR>
<BR>
All is love; love all,<BR>
