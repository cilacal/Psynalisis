I ordered some 100mg bk-2C-B pills off the internet. I felt like getting something a little special, shroom season had come and gone and 6-eapb has had mixed reviews. I quite enjoyed the 6-apb that 6-eapb had been spawned to replace. <br>
<br>
I had my first pill an hour prior to when I was due to meet up with my friends, Bob and Rick.  The feeling of anticipation had been building, there was a beautiful orange sunset that lit the clouds from below, they were uniformly corrugated across almost the entire sky, that hit me as I walked out of ASDA, I was with my parents, they appreciated this as much as me, and this alleviated my fear that I was already 'on the coaster'.  I hadn't tripped for several months before hand and only 6 months ago I had been sold dud 25i tabs.  <br>
<br>
Several experiences in my life have led me to have immense respect for placebos......and if the power of belief can cure cancer it isn't hard to imagine tripping on that same power of belief. So after an hour and a half there was still no sign, at this point I was starting to think I had been scammed, I gave Rick and Bob one each and I had another, and another, silly. Me, Rick and Bob went to play pool, we all bought a pint and an hour passed with a growing buzz that I was still attributing to a placebo, my friends believed they could feel something whilst we were playing, it was only as we were getting up to leave, about 2 hours after I had my first pill, I realised, these were real drugs! <br>
<br>
My friends found that quite funny, Bob suggested I throw up but I wanted to ride this out and see where it took me, I enjoy heavy trips but I was being irresponsible here, I had never taken this substance before and I knew there was a good chance of a steep dose- response curve, 80mg low dose, 100mg mid dose, 120mg high dose, I don't know if this is correct, there is very little info about it on the web, I had never taken bk-2c-b or 2c-b,  but I cannot be sure bk-2C-B has a strong dose response curve until I try smaller amounts.<br>
<br>
So the trip became a little bit of a worry at first, in fact the whole thing was a bit out there, I only have myself to blame! We went to a pub and went to the toilet but this didn't work great although it took away my paranoia that I was going to poo myself, just a twinge of nervous bowls I guess, the paper jammed also, but this wasn't mission critical, Bob checked I was ok when I was in the toilet, I made very little mental assessments after this, the trip was too strong for me to enjoy, also I was uncomfortable with the strength of psychedelic disassociation whilst in town centre on a Saturday night, with strong physical effects such as cramps in the intestines that made me feel like I was going to keel over if I didn't stop in my tracks and take the feeling seriously, I also had to watch that I didn't get too excited as I could feel it might cause palpitations and my heart would go out of rhythm (these are things you really don't want to have to worry about when tripping). <br>
<br>
Another friend joined us later on about T+5 hours, Jools, we met him at the top of a pub. I had my second and last pint for the night, I just had water after this. There was a piano, I like to hear the notes, but my mind was too taken up with being ok. I needed a piss, I couldn't go on the urinal wall, too many people, nervous bladder now, I get this normally anyway, I wasn't embarrassed, even though my fellow urinal 'pissers' were poking fun don't worry we are not having a peak lad this is an old mining town so that kinda banter flies around, its a very interactive place.  On tryptamines I would have been more affected by this moment. I felt very military about the whole operation, I marched down the fire escape and found a pub down the way.  The world was fuzzy but not in a tangible way. Lights couldn't be contained in glass tubes, flickers and sparkles got carried on the breeze. Auras rose into the deep late autumn sky. It was the 30th of November and the town was buzzing but I was enjoying a few seconds out, a few seconds by myself as I walked back from The Goose. Buildings looked like they were about to unfold and fold into something else, anything felt possible like it could all melt at any moment, the whole world, reduced to a greasy mixture of its components, any thing was possible but I wasn't looking for it. I was riding it nicely, but I certainly wasn't beckoning it, and tripping out was way down on my agenda below 'being ok'.<br>
<br>
We retreated to my friends flat a couple of hundred meters down the high street, he lives in the top flat, 4 floors up. I splashed some water on my face. The carpet melted into itself from 8 or so different angels, I felt more comfortable, my ego was still half intact but very quiet. My friends were sitting around rolling up doobies so I sat down and began rolling up a doobie. My weed didn't look right and I gave it to a friend to inspect. It looked false and contrived, usually buds looks like emeralds to me whilst on 'things',  he said it looked nice. Now a few days later in waking life, its still not my favourite stuff, its too skunky and souless but it certainly is cannabis. We went for a walk to the park. A young girl got murdered there not so long ago, one of those things, broad daylight, could have happened anywhere. I put rest to that thought quickly, but in truth wouldn't have had the wits to pursue it if I tried but I was becoming more confident now, still spangled but in a better place, out of the rough, it was nice standing around with people I trust, far from the madness of snivilisation, the stars were the brightest I had ever seen them, we stood about and had a smoke, I felt more in control after a puff.<br>
<br>
We left the park and stood for a moment in the up and coming part of town, where a huge theater stands with a water fountain outside of it, and the streets are clean, and level. The world was very flexible at that moment,. Colours bounced about, the edges of things did a very poor job, translucent gasses took up shapes that dissolved before they assumed real meaning, ghostly vines made of smoke and water vapour that sank back into the concrete they grew from. If I acknowledged this at the time and seen where it took me the whole thing would have turned inside out, maybe another time, probably with another drug, for me at least this isn't one to push. Bob went back to his flat, Rick and myself got a lift back from Jools which was great because a 3 and a half mile hike at 2 or 3 in the morning would have been a pain, to say the least. The drive was incredible, immense, just fantastic, zooming through the night, sodium street lights burning orange, tarmac reflecting the sky, the world is devoid of life! I was feeling happier physically now also knowing I was going home and all would be well. I was with friends and I was also feeling comfortable in this new psychedelic skin, although I was still tragically disorientated and mentally scattered. Skinning up was possible but took half an hour or so. I've been more debilitated off 300ug of LSD, although that seemed to peak and then quickly things got easier, whilst the debilitation in this stuck around.<br>
<br>
Time was quite slow but nothing like what I've experienced with tryptamines. We smoked the joints and my friends came inside my house (parents house). It was 3 in the morning and my folks were asleep so we had to be quiet, we went upstairs. Google Maps was changing colours and zooming in and out at megaspeed. I took amusement in my brain being so willing to visualise on a computer screen because it didn't see the image from the computer as reality.  I took this thought and looked at a painting on the wall of a nude woman. She began dancing, moving naturally but in a stuttered way and becoming more and more real. She was an opaque vision, there was no question she was dancing. Colour was coming off her, Indian maybe, more south pacific maybe. Translucent clothes, swirling around as she moved. I've only had this a few times in my life, strangely off MDMA before, strangely never off LSD.  This is very real to me this kind of imagery. Much of what I experience is psychedelic smoke and mirrors, when I beckon a thought out of my imagination it will not be as real as what manifests when left to its own devices, this is because I am aware I imagined it and this is ingrained into what I am experiencing, but she has to stay in the picture frame, I'm not ready for her to come to life yet...... The problem with me taking too much is that I didn't feel comfortable in its hands, I didn't feel comfortable being taken up by it. I took a well deserved rest for six hours and got up the next day, bright sunshine lighting up the curtains, too yellow, oh no, I'm still in banana land. I never slept, this reminded me of amt. I was just in a trance for a few hours, it probably looked like sleep but it didn't feel like sleep. I was psychedelically exhausted but there was too much of a stimmy side to that bk-2c-b. I had a slight headache. I had a cup of tea and went for a walk in the sun, I had a bit of a smoke, I listened to doctor Lonnie and David wonderful interpretations of Beck. I sat up a tree and went home and watched shite TV all day.......... Come Dine with Me......watching real people interact helped return me to normal.<br>
<br>
The day after this I felt fine. I don't want to make too many assumptions about lower dosages, Rick and Bob had an interesting spin put on their night, Rick had tried 2cb before and said it was very similar. Physically this was much nastier than 30mg of 2ce, although I didn't have any bodyload on bk2cb, I didn't feel particularly sick either, a passing gippyness (slight sickness) at times but nothing much.  Walking was nice, I kind of drifted on 2ce.  Bk2cb has more energy, also it didn't have the strangeness of 2CE, I prefer 2ce for its strangeness, but I would think twice about taking it around town with me if only because the body load. I think bk2cb might be good for certain situations, not parties, not trips, but for all those things in between - BBQs, football matches, christenings, etc<!-- End Body -->
