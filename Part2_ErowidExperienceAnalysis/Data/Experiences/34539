<!-- Start Body -->
Basically, I went to my first rave recently, and didn't want to try E. So I got some Adderall instead. <br>
<br>
9 pm - Home<br>
Continuously drinking water. Hoping to saturate my body before rave with water. <br>
<br>
10 pm - Home<br>
2 Adderall pills (30 mg each) in rapid sucesssion ingested with water. Continuously pissing the water I just drank, and replacing it with more. <br>
<br>
11 pm - On the Streets<br>
Got Rockstar at local store and sipped it. I was very very impatient about sale's clerk, and was tapping my foot. Sale clerk mistook me for drunk, and tried to scam me of my change. <br>
<br>
11:15 pm - Home<br>
Still sipping the Rockstar, very impatient waiting for friends preping for the rave and delay. More foot tapping. Still pissing and drinking water. <br>
<br>
12 am - Outside Rave<br>
Spent car trip trying to prove to drunken friends that I knew the way to rave. Also, foot tapping continued in beat with CD. Finished off the the Rockstar with the last Adderall pill (again 30mg). Took one final piss. <br>
<br>
12 am -> 440pm - Inside Rave<br>
No precise timing details, sorry. Drank 3 more Rockstars, and 6 bottles of water throughout this period of time.  Constantly dehydrated dancing to the beat at the Jungle techno venue. Everytime I get liquid, I chug it down. 5 Minutes after getting liquid, I would be dehydrated already. So I spent a lot of the night dancing cotton-mouthed. Lips cracked due to lack of moisture, and all the sweat I got from dancing soaked my clothing and got rid of my hair gel in under an hour. I was sweating the equilivant of me normally running a 7 minute mile.<br>
 <br>
Dancing was very high tempo, fast and strong, but did not feel tired. Was dancing definitely faster than I normallly could. Legs cramped up a couple of times, but managed to ignore it and still dance without a break. Throat felt very dry throughout rave. Did not piss throughout entire rave, was sweating all the liquid. <br>
<br>
Whenever I drank a Rockstar and went back partying, had a slight stomach reflex action like a heart burn. Mind was a little buzzed, but once I concentrate on something, remarkably focused. For some reason, wasnt exactly horny, but took more notice of girls than usual. Danced all night except for purchase breaks. <br>
Roundup of friends was one short. Became very paranoid about the guy, but still left the rave without knowing his fate. <br>
<br>
5:00 -> 7:10 AM Afterparty<br>
Throat very very dry at this point. Kept going to the bathroom to drink out of the tap, pissing resumes. Noticed that penis has somewhat shriveled, but wasn't too concerned (thought it was cold). Dancing is not as strong and fast as it was in the rave, and actually sat out for a couple of songs. Left Afterparty to go home, felt social, and called a lot of friends. Finally found out where lost friend, relieved. <br>
<br>
8:00 -> 10:00 AM Restaurant<br>
No appetite, but friend forced me to get meal. Got mixed fruit, corned beef, and eggs. Did not enjoy beef or eggs at all. But really enjoyed the fruit. Constantly drinking water again, became aware how ridicously dry throat was. Drank so much, went to piss every 5 minutes. More concern on status of penis. Spent the two hours slowly eating, drinking, and talking. Subject varied, but always was interesting and dedicated to conversation. Throat swollen to the point that the thing that hangs down at the back is brushing against tongue, prompting a desire to swallow it. Drinking water seems to make swallowing less tempting. Became paranoid about the throat, and made friend promise to take care of me if anything happens. Still 'dancing' by bouncing shoulders to some imaginary beat, had ringing in the ears, probably from rave's speakers. <br>
<br>
1030 AM -> 1:00 PM Home<br>
Typed up a lot of emails to friends and chatting online. Typing very fast, completely focused on each conversation yet still maintaining the others. Constantly drinking water again, throat very dry and swallowing reflex still there. Shoulders still bouncing, but this time to Oakenfold. Ringing in ears finally stopped. <br>
<br>
1PM -> 2:30 PM Home<br>
Calling friends all over again, tried to find out what happened to everybody at the rave. Very fast talking and slightly mumbling between words. Tingling in the arms after I finish a 6 page email. Became more paranoid about own health, so conducted lots of research online. Very very relieved to read about penis situation is only temporary due to side effect of Adderall. Also saw previous Caffeine + Adderall article, became very determined to write own due to higher dosage and lesser ingestion time span in own experience. Still drinking, still pissing, still dancing.  <br>
<br>
2:30 - 5:00 PM Home<br>
Called Poison control just for confirmation of details, still paranoid about being traced and aftereffects. Gradually became less and less energetic, but body still not tired. However, eyes feels like shit and very tired. Subconscious dancing finally stops at around 3:30, but talking was still fast between roommates. All of a sudden became dog hungry. Then realized shoulders no longer bouncing, but throat still ridiculously swollen and sore. Drinking and pissing water.<!-- End Body -->
