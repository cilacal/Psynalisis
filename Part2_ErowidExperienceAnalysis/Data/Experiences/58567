First off I would like to share a bit about myself. I am 17 years old and I am completing my final year of high school. I have an A average despite my chronic drug use. When I was 14 I first tried marijuana and did not use anything else until I was 16. I have used Alcohol, Salvia, DXM, Mushrooms, Codeine, Hydrocodone, Nicotine, Caffeine, Oxycontin, Methylphenidate, and obviously, Amphetamines. <br>
<br>
Ever since I got into pharms I had been interested in trying Adderall. I had heard good things about it, and I liked Methylphenidate which is similar. I got into pharms mostly because I liked being high at school but hated pot. It was boring and made my mind wander a bit too much. <br>
<br>
One weekday evening I was at my close friend’s house. I was going through his medicine cabinet in search of some acetaminophen (I had a headache). I came across a bottle that was labeled Adderall. Sudden excitement engulfed me and without hesitation took a handful. When I got home I figured out that they were 10mg pills and I had 14 pills. I decided that tomorrow being Tuesday I should give these a shot. Although I was sure I could handle a large dose, I decided to get my system familiar with the substance so only took 10mg that morning right after first period. I felt little, minor cardiovascular stimulation, minor sweating in stomach area, decreased appetite and increased concentration. It was barely noticeable and it seemed not too different from methylphenidate. I was somewhat disappointed and decided that I would take a higher dose next time.<br>
<br>
The next day I upped the dose to 30 mg. It felt like a medium methylphenidate high with slightly more euphoria when at peak level. The other effects still persisted and I felt no comedown effects and sleep was not affected. I decided that I would take Thursday sober and on Friday I’ll go with 70mgs.<br>
<br>
Thursday passed by with much anticipation and on Friday morning in the middle of first period I swallowed all 7 pills. As soon as they went down a smile appeared on my face. I had a good feeling about this day. At the beginning of second period I began to feel a tingling sensation starting at my thighs and then throughout my entire body. It was very pleasant. My pupils then because dilated and I started to sweat a little bit through my armpits and at my stomach area. I felt slightly chilled but I did not care for it was somehow relaxing. My mouth became a little dry but this was quickly solved with some water and gum. After about 10 minutes of this body high my mood started to increase rapidly. I reached an uncompromised state of euphoria. I was more talkative, more enthusiastic and an important participant in the class discussion. I felt like I could take on the world and win without breaking a sweat. I talked to people I normally would ignore. I saw the beauty in all people and things, nothing could’ve killed my mood, and nothing did.<br>
<br>
This wonderful state came in waves throughout the day and completely killed my appetite. I did not care though, for it was worth it. I went home after school and ate a small and somewhat forced dinner and then departed to my friend’s house as his parents were out for the night. We invited some friends and girls over and I had a great night. All through this time I was high on Adderall and I felt no comedown effects. I had about 5 or 6 shots of whisky that night and it mixed well with the Adderall, it calmed me down and gave me a pleasant body high. I crashed at around 4:00 at my buddy’s house and there were no problems sleeping.<br>
<br>
Overall I love this drug and will definitely use it again, although I will use it with caution as there are horror stories of addiction that I try not to think about. <br>
<br>
Oh yea, another thing. I FIEND for cigarettes then when on Adderall.<!-- End Body -->
