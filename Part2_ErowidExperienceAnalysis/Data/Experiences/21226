Last weekend me and three friends had the house to our selves so we decided to trip. i had a few grams of AMT (which i have tripped off of about 20 times from 200mg to 50) i took approx 100mg at around 6pm my friend B took 100mg as well his girlfriend H took 50 and J took 50 as well since they werent as expierenced with this. <br>
<br>
We started to peak at around 8pm and i was tripping hard as hell. all night we were spinning glowsticks and listening to some great music. B and me were at about the same intensity but J and H couldnt handle it at 50 so they were pretty much sitting around all night. at around midnight we all started to come down. <br>
<br>
started smoking some weed every so often which goes great with AMT. at around 4 or 5 in the morning i asked H if i could have a few xanax cause i felt figity. i crushed it up and snorted it and felt great J tried it also but didnt like the burn so he was turned off. i decided to do another =O oooo baby. <br>
<br>
at around 10am J and H are sleeping and B and i are just cleaning up the house. at around 1pm we left J's house and went to B's and decided to get some beers.  i had about 4 or 5 i think was feeling like a million bucks. later in the after noon some friends stopped by and drove me home. i was pretty drained out so i hit the sack at around 7pm and slept like a baby until 8am. this was probably the first time i didnt have problems trying to get some sleep after tripping. i will probably do this combo in the future.<!-- End Body -->
