I was at a festival in upstate mass. It was at a campground in the mountains surrounded by beautiful fields in late september. I was very happy to be here as I hadn't really attended any festivals this year so I really wanted to have a great time seeing as how this was probably the last one I'll be able to attend until next year. I went up with a large assortment of substances including ayahuasca, 2C-E, and 4-HO-DET. I have done each on their own and had a great time on each, especially 2C-E and ayahuasca. I decided to skip the ayahuasca since I figured I'd want to try flipping some MDMA with something.<br/>
<br/>
Well, it's now or never I thought and with that I acquired 3 caps of MDMA at 100mg each and swallowed 2 of them. Then ate 2 chocolates containing 4-HO-DET, and swallowed a pill containing 10mg 2C-E. I followed this girl to the nitrous tanks and sucked down a balloon. This kicked in the visuals rather quickly. <br/>
<br/>
One thing about the ethycin is that I don't get the head high that mushrooms give me. It's actually quite different than shrooms and has more of a 'research chem' feel to it in that I feel mostly sober mentally. After about an hour??? I decided to take another MDMA pill to see if I could kick thing up a notch both physically/mentally. This was probably a mistake because I don't think I was even close to the peak at that point and this 3rd pill may have been the cause of what happened next. <br/>
<br/>
Even 20min after swallowing it the only difference I felt was the visuals increasing. And they just kept increasing, and increasing, and increasing.... I went to sit outside the hippie-rave cabin to enjoy the psychedelic music. I never felt sick or anything as these visuals intensified nor did I feel like I couldn't handle it, or like I was loosing myself/ego like on too much acid.<br/>
   <br/>
At this point the visuals where ridiculously intense. Everything changed, it was more intense than high doses of ayahuasca. Everything was glowing and covered in brightly colored morphing fractals. I figured I had better meet up with my friends before things get too intense so they could help me out just in case things get out of hand. I trekked into the woods and I wasn't able to get too far. It was nighttime but all I could see was a kolidascope of fractals and nothing more, no trees no people, no tents not even myself, was visible anymore. <br/>
<br/>
One of the weirdest things is even through all this I felt relatively straight mentally. Nothing close to sober but for the most part not too bad just like a had a psychedelic blindfold on or something, and I was starting to get hungry (remember I'm on lots of psychedelics including 300mg of MDMA). So I asked some people I could hear passing by to help me find a way to get food and water. So they helped me to the food stand and I just held out some money and said 'food please!' They didnt understand what was going on so I explained to the guy. It was very difficult to get the money to hand to him. <br/>
<br/>
Eventually the food made it to my hands but it was not very fulfilling. I was trying to remain positive but once my body started going numb like when your leg falls asleep I knew something was wrong. I just lay on the ground and things started to get bad, my recollection of everything from that point on is somewhat gone but I can tell you that it was bad. I started getting random pains, I just started saying I need pharmies but I knew I wouldn't get any this way so I gave in and said 'help, I need a hospital, I'm dying, 911' etc... It was a totally different bad trip than acid. You can watch yourself die, I felt like I was becoming a zombie. I felt like I was watching resident evil but and I was one of the living dead. At the time this analogy made complete sense and now I have a hard time understanding my mindset. It wasn't like acid were it feels like my brain being put through a blender, I did feel like I would die though, if those negative physical symptoms never came into play I probably could have handled the blinding visuals and rode it out, but once they kicked in my mindset went to shit.<br/>
<br/>
After they fixed me my visuals died down quite a bit but were still pretty intense. They let me go and I could think of was how stupid I was. I shouldn't of been so gluttonous with the drugs, I should have obtained to xanax/valium beforehand, and I shouldn't have said so much stupid shit after they found me. Even though these research chems can be fun I think I'll stick to natural drugs from now on.<!-- End Body -->
