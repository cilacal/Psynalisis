<br>
I’m now at home after one of the most fun nights I’ve ever had. All because of speed. <br>
<br>
My friend (we’ll call her cheese) and I had wanted to try harder drugs for ages now but due to unreliable dealers and other factors we just never had the chance. We found out that a local alternative club was having some live local bands play; we brought tickets because a lot of our friends were going. I had been before but always left early as it becomes really boring. We thought this would be the perfect place to try something new as it was just a small place and we were surrounded by lots of people we knew. So we asked a friend of ours if it was possible to get something for the night.<br>
<br>
We knew we were getting something but didn’t know what. Neither did our friend. We would find out when we got there. We got to the venue at 6pm and walked over to the station (about 5 minutes away) where our friend was going to pick up the drugs. She went off while me and cheese waited. On her return, she had 4 white tablets, each with a coke bottle imprint on one side and the coca-cola symbol on the other. There was one for me, herself, cheese (female) and two other friends of mine were going to share one (both male). We took the tablet on the walk back because we heard it would take half an hour to kick in. This was at about 6:20.<br>
<br>
Back at the venue we waited in line to get in. Friends of mine were coming up to me and asking if I was ok because they knew what we had just done. But I was really fine. The girl who got it for us went off to have some bongs but the rest of us went inside. We watched the first band and I was really bored. At 7:00pm every one who had taken it was talking really fast, walking around and saying how much fun they were having. I still felt nothing! All their pupils were huge.<br>
 <br>
Really, really big. I asked people if my eyes were bigger but they were not. I was really disappointed at 7:20 as it had been an hour since I had taken it and I felt nothing different while they were all having so much fun! I started walking off to the toilet and as I started walking my head had a little spin. That was it, I felt it. I felt taller and healthier and more fun. All within 5 seconds. I ran back to my friends to tell them. They were all exited. I went outside and was talking to some people I kinda know (a lot of them were stoned) and I was jumping from pole to pole and up and down steps.<br>
<br>
Me and cheese walked around the place cause it felt cool. There was a hallway and walking down it was heaps of fun. It felt like I was going too fast for it. I have a friend who works at the place and she came up to me and told me that the security guards suspected something and to calm down as it would fall back on her. So I went to sit down with a friend of mine who was there alone. I was talking to him but he is very into music so he wasn’t very responsive. I watched the band from where I was sitting and the strangest thing happened. The band turned into a TV screen and started breaking up (not blurry just like when the stations drop out and lines go up the TV) When that stopped I just sat there alone.<br>
<br>
That was the worst thing I’ve ever done. I started thinking about everything. I felt like I had so many problems. I didn’t know if I should stay and talk to my friend who was alone, or should I be moshing? Or should I go to the toilet? Or should I go home and do homework? I had so many thoughts in my head and was having a terrible time. I was going to ring someone to pick me up and go home. I had thoughts of myself in bed, not being able to sleep. Just tossing and turning and being really bored. I was feeling really bad because of all these thoughts. I started to wish I had never done speed and I got up to tell cheese I was going to go home.<br>
<br>
When I stood up though, I felt really great again. I couldn’t think of one problem I had. I thought about them but they were nothing! I was too good to think about problems. I just wanted to have fun. I was so exited! I ran around to everyone I knew and told them not to sit down. I was so happy at my new discovery and continued congratulating myself. I hung around with cheese since then, we talked lots and met new people and talked to them. I wouldn’t even think about letting any of them sit down.<br>
<br>
I had really bad jaw clenching and so did cheese and the girl who got it for us. The guys who had half each had none. I find now that I have small chunks out of one of my cheeks. I bought some star burst to chew but I only got about 2 because I was in a generous mood and gave them all away. While I was there it was going really slowly because I was moving too fast for everyone but as soon as it was over, I felt it went too fast. It finished at 11pm<br>
<br>
Before I went home I went to a park with some people. I don’t remember why but I ended up doing laps around the park. When I stopped after about 10 I said, “I could’ve done way more”. I felt like I could’ve but I think something speed does to you is makes you really cocky as during the night, cheese was saying how hot she was and the other girl was telling us how talented she was.<br>
<br>
At about 1 or 2am, I went home to bed and even though I was a bit restless, I went to sleep pretty easy - considering. I woke up in the morning and felt great. I decided that I like doing speed the best as you are alert the whole time and able to have fun and socialise (unlike with dope) and you don’t get clumsy and incoherent (like with alcohol). I can see it would be easily addictive as last night I was wondering where I could get some more and just wanted to be on a high again. I am definably going to do speed again and I highly recommend it to anyone. Just don’t sit down!<br>
<br>
Just some info-<br>
<br>
Me- about 60kg, Male. Took over an hour to kick in, lasted longer on me than any of the others. I’m pretty shy but I was happy to talk to everyone. Hadn’t eaten anything except lollies all day. 16years<br>
<br>
Cheese- fifty something kgs. Female. Hit her the strongest and the quickest. She is pretty out going and did talk to everyone. Hadn’t eaten anything all day. 17years<br>
<br>
Lorrie- Pretty tall girl. Female. Smokes a lot of pot. She mixed it with pot. Hit her pretty quickly. Was running around looking after everyone. Got a bit obsessive compulsive. 16years.<br>
<br>
Mick- less than 70kgs? Only took half a tablet. No clenching. Hit after about 40 mins. Got very energetic, moshed a lot. 16years<br>
<br>
Jesity- 70+kgs. ½ tablet only. Loud and cocky anyway. Those traits were just emphasised. Became very energetic. Some experience with e and speed previously. Moshed the whole time. 17years.<br>
<br>
I hope this has been as helpful to you as this site has been to me.<!-- End Body -->
