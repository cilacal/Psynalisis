So, one Friday night, me and my friends 'D' and 'B' were looking for some rolls. We had rolled the weekend before, and we wanted to again because it was the best time we had ever had. So we called our hookup to see if he had any beans. He said he didn't, but he said he had this new shit called AMT. We had no clue what it did, so we asked, and he said it made you roll for awhile, and then you started to trip your nuts off for a long ass time. I said that we should give it a try. <br>
<br>
We said we would call him back in awhile to see how many we wanted. So we started to think about where we were going to do it, so we came to my house and looked up AMT online, and it sounded tight as shit, so we gave our man a call back, and he said he could do it. So we met up with him and he wanted to know if we could sling some for him, so we gave him the money up front for ours pills, and he gave us 14 pills to sell. So we left and picked up our friend 'S' and smoked some more before we went into my house. <br>
<br>
All 4 of us were ripped as shit when we got inside, and we went straight up to my room and took the pills. Each one had 25 mg in it, and we each took one. It took awhile for it to hit us, but after like an hour, we felt like we were rollin, and for me, the sensation wasn't that strong, but it felt good. Then about 30 minutes later, I was holding a glow stick and I was waving it around. Then it hit me, I started to see in frames, and everything was fuzzy and wavy. <br>
<br>
We all were having a good time, and 'B' and I went into my bathroom to take some more. We opened the capsule and poured all the powder out. We divided it in half, and put it in a tissue and swallowed it. It took about 20 minutes for that to hit me, but when it did, holy fucking shit!!! I was seein whirlpools on the walls, the techno was sounding good as shit, and my body felt a sensation it had never felt before. I told 'B', 'Damn, I feel like my body is sitting here, and I'm not in it.' He knew exactly what I meant. <br>
<br>
It was almost a numb feeling throughout my whole body. I then realized 'S' had fallen asleep, so we let him sleep. 'D' asked 'B' if he could have another pill. So 'B' let him and 'D' told me to come in the bathroom with him. We split the pill open, and divided in in half, and parachuted it just like I did with the other half earlier. So I had pretty much had 2 pills of AMT, and I was so fucked up, I couldnt even talk in complete sentences. When we came out of the bathroom, we layed down in our beds and started to look at shit. I was feeling so fucked up, I was seeing patterns and whirlpools and little bubbles floating across the room. Then I would look at my walls and they would start expanding and coming in. <br>
<br>
Then 'S' woke up and he was going to bitch about turning the muscic down, but before he could say it, he was like 'Holy shit.' I asked him what, and he was like, 'That has to be the coolest feeling ever, waking up and you are tripping.' I thought to myself, that would be pretty bad ass, but then I realized how fucked up I was, and started to go into my own world. I wasnt in the normal world, I had moved into completely different world. I was beyond fucked up, the most fucked up I had ever been. I looked at the clock and it was about 4 in the morning, and I was still fucked up as shit, and the feeling was still getting stronger, the hallucinations were getting more intense. I asked if it was the same for everyone, and we all started to laugh hysterically. <br>
<br>
I was so happy. We just talked for the next 3 hours about how fucked up we were. It was about 7:30, and we were still fucked up as shit, and I heard my mom, she had woken up. We were up the whole night. We tried to go to sleep, but the feeling was so intense that we couldnt sleep. 'D' kept on puttin his head on his pillow and lifting back up, he couldnt help it. I couldnt help chattering my teeth. It was so loud. 'B' was rollin all over his bed. 'S' had fallen asleep, because he only had 1 pill, 'D' and 'B' had 1 and a half, and I had 2. We were all fucked up. <br>
<br>
We stayed in my room until my parents left the house. When they left, we all got up and started to walk around my house and everything looked so weird. I was still tripping. We all were except 'S'. We ate breakfast and headed on out. 'S' went in his own car and went home, while me, 'D' and 'B' were all driving in 'D's' car. I would not recommend driving on this.  <span class='erowid-caution'>[Erowid Note: 
Driving while intoxicated, tripping, or extremely sleep deprived is dangerous and irresponsible because it endangers other people. <a href="/chemicals/show_image.php?i=dmt/dmt_contraindications1.gif">Don't do it!</a>]</span> <br>
<br>
We took it at 10:45 the night before, and it was 10:00 in the morning and the feeling was just as strong as it was at 4:00 in the morning. I couldnt believe how long this was lasting. We smoked and it was the most fucked up high ever. After we smoked, we went to 'B's' house and smoked out in his gazebo. I stared into the trees and the braches started to tie themselves together. They were moving around like snakes. We sat outside until about 3:00 in the afternoon, and we were all still trippin. But we realized that we needed to sell the rest of the of the AMT. We went out and sold the rest of them. Then we called up our man and met up with him to give him the money. He saw us and said that we looked fucked up as shit, and we told him about how fucked up we were and that we were still fucked up as shit. <br>
<br>
It was like 8:00 at night, almost 24 hours after we had taken the AMT, and we were still fucked up as shit. So we smoked more and 'D' dropped us off at each of our houses. I was high as shit, and my body felt numb from the AMT, and the hallucinations were still going on, just not as intense. I stayed up until the effects wore off completely. It was 11:20 when I couldnt feel anything anymore. A day of being the most fucked up I've ever been. I would have to say AMT is my drug of choice. The next day, I was in the best mood. It felt like the world had been lifted off my shoulders. It was the AMT, I felt this way for the next 4 days. I couldnt believe how good AMT was. I would highly recommend that you try this shit. It was fun as shit.<!-- End Body -->
