5-MeO-DiPT can be surprisingly potent. It gave me a bit of a kick in the ass a while ago, so I'll take the opportunity here to talk about my experiments a bit. Please note that the dosages given below have been measured with an electronic scale with 2mg accuracy; however I can not entirely rule out the possibility of human error or a malfunction of the scale.<BR>
<BR>
I had read the trip disaster stories from Erowid, but most were with very large doses so I wasn't afraid. I started my experiments with 15mg (quite high), as my tolerance for almost all drugs (tryptamines included) seems to be higher than the average. Fitting the picture, I got only what I in retrospect would say were threshold effects. Next try was 10mg insufflated, which also produced threshold effects.<BR>
<BR>
I then decided to up the dose a lot to find out if 5-MeO-DiPT had anything to offer me (I was quite sceptical after the initial experiences). I ingested 26mg (a strong dose for most people, I think) of the substance, and as expected, got very nice effects. Not as psychedelic as LSD, but heightened senses and a nice body feeling coupled with some psychedelic ideation and a few visuals. Very nice :) Later I took 22mg once at home and once at a party, and had good, mellow, subtle experiences. So I thought I knew what 5-MeO-DiPT was all about: a nice little tryptamine with euphoric body feelings, not at all intense on the mental side, perfect for a social setting for instance.<BR>
<BR>
One weekend I was taken by surprise by an urge to trip. I hadn't prepared at all (I usually do prepare a little) and I had just had the most intense psychedelic experience of my life some time ago (with LSD), so I wasn't looking for a full-blown trip. I decided to take some 5-MeO-DiPT for a mellow evening of listening to music etc. I decided to take a tiny bit more than I had taken before, and settled for a 30mg dose (again, a hefty dose for someone with a normal tolerance). I was pretty certain that the trip would be very light on the psyche, as 26mg had not been intense at all.<BR>
<BR>
What followed was an experience that was as intense, in part even more intense, than the LSD trip that I had taken some time ago. I would say it was level 4 on Graeme Carl's scale. I would roughly estimate that the intensity was comparable with 3-5 hits of european acid, which would AFAIK probably translate to at least 6-10 hits of US acid. All in all the trip was _very_ similar to the LSD trip; I might have some trouble telling LSD and 5-MeO-DiPT apart at those doses. Visuals were almost identical with LSD visuals, and the psychedelic ideation also very much resembled that of LSD. The experience also had something that reminded me of 5-MeO-DMT, although obviously it was not _that_ intense.<BR>
<BR>
5-MeO-DiPT would appear to be a pretty promising candidate for an LSD replacement for me. The only negative differences were strong nausea (which quickly passed) and muscle tremors. Also, any possible (neuro)toxicity is of course a big question mark. Anyway, where I had previously considered 5-MeO-DiPT a 'light' psychedelic for social and recreational use, I now consider it to be more of a 'serious' psychedelic that has similar potential as LSD in self-analysis and other 'serious' uses for psychedelic drugs. <BR>
<BR>
I would urge anyone experimenting with 5-MeO-DiPT to use an accurate method of measuring doses in the milligram scale AND to keep in mind that the dose-response-curve seems to be extremely steep. I don't know what would've happened had I taken for example 40mg.. or the 30mg at a party or a similar setting, instead of at home. The experience was very intense even with 30mg and I had some trouble figuring out what was happening. I tried to communicate with a friend on IRC, but all efforts failed miserably :) At times I felt compelled to sit still or lie on the floor with my eyes closed to shut out visual input. Some of the trouble adapting to the experienced was likely caused by surprise at the intensity of the effects.<BR>
<BR>
The time frame of the trip was comparable to LSD, except that it took 1,5 hours to come up. At +12h I was able to fall asleep, but the effects were still noticeable.<!-- End Body -->
