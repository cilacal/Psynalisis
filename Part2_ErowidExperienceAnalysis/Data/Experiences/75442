<!-- Start Body -->
I am an experienced psychonaut, having taken my first LSD trip about 35 years ago. Since then I've experienced as many interesting psychedelics as possible, including MDA, MDMA, n,n DMT, 2C-D, 2C-E, 2C-I, 4AcO-DMT, 4AcO-DiPT, 5MeO-DALT and Mescaline. I've been growing/extracting Mescaline from cacti for over ten years., and extracting n,n DMT from a variety of plants for the last 2 years.<br>
<br>
Several months ago I had the opportunity to procure some synthetic 5MeO-DMT. After doing some research on the 'net, I purchased the smallest amount possible. I wasn't very impressed by the trip reports I had read, simply because the visuals were supposed to be much less than n,n DMT, and because some reports actually made the trip sound scary.<br>
<br>
When the package arrived, I decided to experience it in exactly the same setting as that which I experience n,n DMT : Laid back on a half-dozen pillows, in a darkened room, wearing headphones blaring various albums by the Mahavishnu Orchestra. I don't have a scale accurate enough to measure out 15 mg, which is suggested by some to be a 'heavy dose', so I packed a bowl of Cannabis and sprinkled what I thought might be 15 mg on top of the bowl. I have no idea how much it really was, but I used a tiny spoon in order to have a finite measure upon which I could guestimate future doses. After melting the freebase into the Cannabis, I took a hit. <br>
<br>
After releasing the hit, I waited about 90 seconds. All I felt was a slight energy which might have been placebo/anticipation, so I took a second hit. Upon releasing this hit, I noticed some visual distortion and a building euphoria. Since I felt no fear, panic or anxiety, nothing 'scary' at all, I quickly finished the bowl. As I laid down the bowl, my vision altered (I couldn't tell whether my eyes were opened or closed) and my body began to feel like lead. I was filled with an intense euphoria and I began to see brilliant multi-faceted diamond geometrics. Not the wild, brightly-colored visuals of n,n DMT, but bright, white, prismatic geometrics. After a period of time, the visuals began to fade (about 15 minutes), but the euphoria lasted much longer.  I was prepared to experience breathing problems from some of the trip reports I'd read, but it wasn't really a problem. <br>
<br>
Now when I experience 5MeO-DMT, I do it the same way, without the pauses in between hits, with exactly the same amount. 5MeO is not as visual as n,n DMT, it doesn't produce the synasthesia that n,n DMT provides, but the euphoria generated seems to be much more intense. Without the synasthesia, music appreciation is diminished somewhat, but this seems to make it easier for me to contemplate my problems and pending decisions/actions.  The only negative is breathing. I am an experienced diver, with over 3,000 hours logged in the briny deep, and to me, breathing while experiencing 5MeO is like breathing through a scuba regulator. Because of the body load (the leaden feeling ), breathing seems to require a little effort. Bear this in mind if you are a first-timer, as I feel that this could lead to panic/anxiety, which would be unwarranted. <br>
<br>
Needless to say, I procured a much larger supply as quickly as I could.<br>
<br>
My business takes me away from civilization for 10 days at a time. I harvest wild Mother Nature. During this time, except for the men who work for me, I am 50 to 100 miles away from anyone or anywhere. We work from dawn 'til dusk, and if I'm not tired, and if my mindset is right, I'll smoke 2 or sometimes even 3 bowls of Cannabis/5MeO in an evening. There is no hangover the next day, in fact, I feel good, better than I would if I'd not smoked anything (I think). I never have a problem getting to sleep, either.<!-- End Body -->
