Last night I decided to get very drunk for the first time. I had never gotten drunk before this. Almost everyone at my age (I am 16) has been drunk before, so I decided to give it a try. I have tried other drugs before. I smoke alot of pot, I've done mushrooms, half a hit of lsd, and tripped Robotussin twice. I wanted to get drunk, but I did not want to be throwing up. I decied to do it after my parents and brother went to bed. I decided to take 6 shots of vodka.<BR>
<BR>
It was 1:30 before my parents and brother went to sleep. I took the bottle out of my parents stash of alcohol thinking they wouldnt miss one bottle. I took my six shots by about 2 am and there was about a quarter of a bottle left. I decided that it was fairly pointless to leave the bottle a fourth full so I finished it. In a bout half an hour I started to feel really messed up. Everything I was watching on the tv was extremely enjoyable. I began to get extremelly tired so I decided to head upstaris. Walking was very interesting. I didn't really stumble but it was not easy to walk. I walked into my bathroom and did the dumbest thing I did in a year. I reached for the drinking glass but I knocked into the sink breaking it. So I through the bottle away and then took the empty bottle out to the trash.<BR>
<BR>
I went to sleep at about 3am. I woke up at 11 am and was still feeling extremely messed up. I guess that I have a low tolerance for alcohol. Much too my disapointment my mom was still homw when I got up. I guess she had to go to a denist appointment. I said hi and walked into the kitchen. I dont think that she thought I was drunk. There no milk in the kitchen to make some cereal so I decided to take a shower. I got very dizzy in the shower and had to sit down a couple of times.I was wondering how long the effects of the alcohol would last. After mentally reveiwing the effects of last night I realized it is difficult to remember things when under the effects of alcohol. The whole night seemed like it happened in the course of a half an hour. After I got out of the shower I was feeling alright so I cleaned up the house and talked to a few of my friends online. Its 2:20 now and im still feeling the effects. I did not think it would this long. The only thing I am worrried about is that I have to go to a guitar lesson at 4:00. I hope I am down then because I dont really wanna drive drunk.<BR>
<BR>
Alcohol was definetely enjoyable, but I think I would rather do it at a time when I didn't have to be at home. It lasts quite long. Its been about 11 and a half hours now. It lasts almost 4 times longer than pot. I usually come down from marijuana in about 3 to 4 hours. I guess its just going to be an interesting day. Overall it was an enjoyable experiment.<!-- End Body -->
